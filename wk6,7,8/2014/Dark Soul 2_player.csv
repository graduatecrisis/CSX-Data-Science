It's as simple asI've never done this before, but Dark Souls 2 deserves creating an account and submitting a review.I'm not going to address the technical issues the pc port is facing, or the quality of ingame graphics. It's a separate problem and I hope Namco Bandai will face some  consequences of their false advertisement/bate and switch tactics.Dark Souls 2 is not a Souls game. It's as simple as that. It's missing everything that made the previous games so special. Starting with the controls, combat mechanics, loot system, game world, boss fights and ending with the difficulty level. It's all gone. Replaced with mechanics that try to ""innovate""and remain similar to the previous game at the same time.The controls feel clunky and unresponsive. The character seems ""heavy"" and the movement is sluggish. Where in previous games the overall rules applied to both the player and the enemies. In Dark Souls 2 there's a different set of rules (stamina, poise, movement etc) for the player and the monsters. Some will have infinite stamina and spam heavy attacks to no end. Other's will ""track"" your movement in the middle of their attack animation. We're talking about spinning 360 degrees while ""channeling"" their attack. Some will even go as far as to reset the attack animation and hit you when they should be recovering from their last attack.The world design is inconsistent and seems out of place. One minute you're fighting a boss in a giant mill just to take the elevator up to the iron keep. The problem is - there's no keep above the mill. Level design is poor at best and the multitude of bon fires makes little sense. In some cases you'll have 4 of them in an area the size of Undead Asylum. You'll find yourself fighting 4 of the most powerful demons in the land to overcome a bit of rubble blocking the way in the forest...Instead of creating interesting enemies From decided to toss a bunch of mobs at you to make up what they lack in design with numbers. The difficulty doesn't come from good design choices but cheap gimmicks. Enemies attacking you through doors or a gate. Bosses with adds during the fight, bosses that ""multiply"" during the fight. It's all based on cheesy gimmicks. Even the fights that suppose to resemble if not imitate boss fights from the previous game are simply boring.Deaths feel cheap. It feels like the game is trolling you by not following it's own rules. The concept of having to die in order to get loot has no place in a Souls game.Overall the game is a huge disappointment.It's got as much in common with previous Souls games as Resident Evil 6 has with the original Resident Evil ;)An average imitation at best.…"

The binding is really difficult to do, and the camera is clunky. The menu's still have Xbox 360 controller buttons instead of actual PC key-binds which is ridiculous. They said it would be a decent port, but it's barely better than the consoles. The only thing great about the game that's different is the graphics and fps which is improved from consoles. If you wish to play this with a controller, it's worth it more than 360 or PS3. HOWEVER, I SHOULDN'T BE FORCED TO PLAY ON A CONTROLLER. If a game is released on a PC, I expect, no I demand that the controls are actually worth using. I didn't buy Dark Souls II on PC to play it with a controller.…"
7,"I made this account just for this game. Pre ordered it 2 months before release. For the first four days I couldn't even start it due to White Screen of Death (crash during startup).Now the game has been fixed.Gameplay wise this is a great game. But the company's false advertising (graphics, lighting etc) forces me to keep my score down.7/10"

What you're left with is a mediocre hack and slash action romp that looks at times like a PS2 game.Claims made about Dark Souls 2 being developed for the PC natively have turned out to be another marketing gimmick and a bold faced lie. Not a grain of critique was spent on the gaming press about the obvious bad keyboard and mouse controls, that on top of everything else, have almost a half a second delay on every action you take. Xbox controller icons are left in place from the Xbox, proving that the game is just another quick console port. Nowhere it is explained, that you need a controller to properly play the title on PC, which makes sense from a marketing perspective. It should be made clear, that the PC gamer will have to put another 20 euros towards the title in the form of a Xbox controller, but it isn't.Don't believe the fan-boy hype. This is not a PC game, but a bad console port of a game which is overshadowed by the brilliance of the original Dark Souls.…"
8,"Game has been updated and seems to work for most now. I haven´t played for long yet, but from what I saw I´d give the game a 10/10 minus one point each for graphics (only slightly improved from DaS1) and controls (I use a Xbox-controller, so they are fine for me, but even when using mouse/keyboard the games always displays the Xbox buttons solely, which is unlikely to be fine for everyone)."
9,"Revising my first review. Patch fixed everything. Game looks and plays fantastic. It's Dark Souls 2, you will die alot and get angry. But you will have fun while doing so."
7,"This game would be a solid 10/10 if the PC port wasn't broken. I had to go through various forums and plenty methods to even run the game, which is unforgettable for a 50€ release. Huge amount of people still cant get it to run, I was lucky to get it resolved.Apart from that, game is great so far."
10,"Now have serious bugs (I have to switch down the HDMI port every times when I run the game, and only run in windowed mode not fullscreen).The diminishing healthbar and the evaporing  enemies are really annoying, but it is a great game, when they fix the starting bugs I will change the rate."

6,"This game is not much fun anymore. It's either input lag or the unfair packs like the Three Sentinels. I don't like to summon people to beat the game, but this one leaves me no other choice - unlike DS1. And that makes me sad and angry. The input lag is annoying as hell. You block at 100% stamina and simple enemies slay through it. The game feels stable, but the fights don't feel balanced.This game is not much fun anymore.

And that makes me sad and angry. The input lag is annoying as hell. You block at 100% stamina and simple enemies slay through it. The game feels stable, but the fights don't feel balanced. It just so frustrating. I know, the game is ment to be hard. I beat DS1 several times. But this one is has not the same feeling. I'm always feeling like being cheated by the engine.Another big issue is the bad durability of weapons. Having a favorite weapon for PvE is almost impossible, because durability is soooo low. I always find myself fighting mobs with my favorite, leveled weapon until they vanish (after 10 - 15 kills) so I can reach a boss with this weapon. And why the hell, don't enemies do damage to themself in close ranges?!!Another big issue is PvP. Too often, the lagging decides who the winner is. Lagstabs, teleports and taking damage after having dodged ten meters away becomes the norm. And you can call yourself lucky not to meet a hacker, because the PC platform is already infested with them. The game has no cheat countermeasures in place. (Why not make the client verify actions on both ends, compare them and just quit the duel when the comparison is negative?) It comes down to use a dashcam (record the PvP matches) and report the hackers to Steam along with a YouTube video.The overall map design feels less creative than in DS1. The zones are more separated so there is not that experience anymore, that you can look from one end of the world to the other. I liked that flavor of DS1 very much and it added to the atmosphere. In DS1 the zones felt like they really belong together.I hope, FromSoftware will deploy some patches to address the input lag and the PvP lagging. Right now, after 40 hours into the game, I'll take a longer break and wait for patches.…"

On screen hints tell you to press the green 'A' or the blue 'X'.   Want to go up a ladder?   In every other PC game you walk in to a ladder and start to climb.   In DS2 it's ctrl-left click. Why would they make it so awkward?    I tried to swap weapons and ended up consuming a good portion of the healing stones.Another bad part worth mentioning is the combat.  It's .... awful.  You can lock your target by pressing the middle mouse button, but it doesn't really make much difference.   I created a cleric and armed myself with a great big metal mace and picked a fight with a little old lady cooking a meal (I'm very brave, I know).   She beat me to death with her ladle.   Not once but many times.  So many times in fact I had to roll a new character to get past the point.In short this is not worth buying on the PC.   For the consoles maybe, but not the PC.…"

I didn't beat it, but I played for 12 hours total before quitting. I'm still disappointed by how the game turned out and only gets one point more this time, but I want to review it once more from scratch because I want to make the review better, more comprehensible and I want to expand it a little.The game, as a sequel to Dark Souls, feels disappointing. It was stripped down of everything that made Dark Souls 1 good and went through major changes that, for the most part, are changes for the worse. But, let's start with the pros first.Some of the mechanics are executed far better than in the former game. I really liked the presence of Human Effigies as a cure to hollowing instead of ""liquid"" and ""soft"" humanity that could be acquired pretty quickly, but also could be lost by one fatal mistake. In Dark Souls 2, when you die you lose your human form, but you can reverse the hollowing with ease - you don't even have to go back to the bonfire; you can do it immediately.Another thing is that the locations are far larger than they were in Dark Souls 1 so there's a lot more to explore. They are branched too, so very often you can get to the boss by many ways. Plus, some of the locations are truly breathtaking and atmospheric. I'm especially talking about No-man's Wharf and Harvest Valley with astonishing view on the humongous and abstract windmill. This is, unfortunately, too little to make me enjoy the game and give it a higher score, as numerous flaws overshadowed every good aspect the game had.Now for the flaws.Let's start with the key element and core of every Souls game - the combat system. In Dark Souls 1, the combat was very precise. The slow pace of battles and well-made-but-not-perfect animations made you ""feel"" the weight of the equipment, making it a major part of making up tactics against an enemy and your playstyle in general. When you wanted to be a knight armed to the teeth, fighting with a sword bigger than yourself, it was obvious that you had to sacrifice mobility for it, while choosing a leather armor and a scimitar was the exact opposite. In Dark Souls 2 it doesn't matter - every piece of the equipment feels super-light and the only thing indicating you actually travel heavy is the rolling speed - and it feels very forced.The difficulty - another key element of the Souls series, and something it is always proud of. Dark Souls 1 was really unique in this aspect - it was hard and punishing, but very fair at the same time; you always knew what you did wrong and could learn from your mistakes. Dark Souls 2 is nothing like that. After a few deaths you start to notice that most of them weren't your fault, but the game's. The difficulty was amped up just for the sake of being hard, while forgetting to add fairness along the way. You often die from being outnumbered by groups enemies that ""aggro"" all at the same and stunlock you to death or cheap tricks, like mummies in Lost Bastille that can explode and get back on their feet as many times as they want. There's also tracking of your moves present in the enemy AI - they spin around following you during every second of their attack animation, giving you next to no chance to dodge. And to make things even more ""exciting"", your character's movements are now clunky and awkward - he gets tired really quickly and can't dodge properly.Now, the atmosphere. Dark Souls 2 lacks certain peculiarity Demon's Souls and Dark Souls 1 had, giving you generic Dark Fantasy stuff in the veins of Gothic series. Now, it wouldn't be too bad if it had any soul (pun not intended) - despite what I've stated above, almost all locations feel bland and uninspired. Most of the them are either a forest, a castle or something trying too hard to mimic a location from the first game. Literally, none of these made any impression on me, aside from boredom. Another thing is - why are you even in Drangleic. You don't have any purpose of being there, aside from looking for alleged cure for the curse, which you are told right at the beginning, doesn't exist.The level design in this game is absolutely terrible. Aside from the blandness, the locations' arrangement in the world map makes no sense or logic whatsoever. The creators went for Demon Souls-esque hub world with the central point being Majula. It's not a bad thing, if executed properly, but in this game, the locations feel very disconnected. They are always preceeded either a tunnel or a cave and there's no smooth transition between them.Concluding - Dark Souls II is a pretty average game with many technical difficulties and quirky, badly executed mechanics, that may be good for die-hard fans of the series, but for an average gamer, who likes challenging games, it's too unbalanced and badly-made to be enjoyed. Hence only a 5/10.…"

I was disappointed to find that it only showed the XBox controller buttons in place of the keyboard commands and it took some rebinding to get keyboard and mouse rebound to a functional set-up but I was ultimately treated to a fantastic game. The atmosphere in Dark Souls, as well as its environmental storytelling and bosses were all phenomenal, and I've sunk many long hours into the game.I've therefore been waiting with a great deal of excitement for Dark Souls 2. Dark Souls was a rushed port in response to high PC player demand so some problems were expected, but surely there wouldn't be any with Dark Souls 2, which was developed for PC simultaneously ... Wrong! The Xbox controller prompts are back. The default bindings are appalling, and many keyboard buttons can't actually be bound for no apparent reason. The controls are laggy in a game were rapid responsiveness are key. There's also the more minor issue of the massive downgrade in the lighting of the game, which hopefully may be fixed at some point for PC.In short, this is once again an embarrassingly bad port, and I'd advise waiting for fixes from the developers or modders before getting it. What I've played of the game itself seems great, but it's simply not a finished product and I object to being sold games in this condition.…"

Luckily for me, there were a bunch of fans that fixed the company work for us gamers without asking for a single penny, so I ended up enjoying the game I had bought (half of my money should have been to those guys who fixed the game), and I remembering me thinking ""they wont do this again, right? The backlash was pretty hard on them"" well yesterday I bought this game (the sequel) and I'm already feeling like I will need those guys who fixed the first one again! Really?. For starters, it doesn't initiate if I have my controller plugged onto the pc, it just crashes, so I cant play it with my controller (not that I would like it but, It's the recommended way right?), amusingly enough, it doesnt seems to matter if I have my nostromo plugged into the pc or not (I tried unplugging it, plugging it with the controller, plugging the controller alone, etc) and guess why it doesnt matter? because it doesnt recognize it. So that leaves me out with traditional keyboard and mouse, so ok. I try to start the game: CTD!, try it again, CTD when I first move! I'm starting to have a Deja vu from the first game (which had several graphics problems that luckily those fixes from those saviors fixed for me, which made my game CTD), so I use Nvidia control center to deactivate several graphics options (rather force them) and the game stops CTDing. Yay! Who needs graphics, right? well turns out the controlls are a damn mess. Better than the first one, but not by far. So I end up getting really pissed and as a result I come here to warn people that if you buy this and have the astonishing luck that it works like intended, you will have to deal with camera and key binding issues that will have you dead not because the game is difficult, but because you will feel paralyzed by the control system.So, I'm planning to get a refund on this garbage and move on to something better from another company, a company that doesnt have his fans fixing their games for them... Oops It seems there are none of those nowadays.…"

The difficulty was not the main focus, and interviews with the director shows that. The director of Dark Souls 2 took a very different approach, and it shows in even the dialogue of the game.In the first few cutscenes, the player is told ""you're going to die and lose souls over and over again"", it is almost like that is coming from the developers. This wasn't seen in the previous games.The gameplay suffers from this too. The game tries way too hard to surprise you and punish you. with very predicable surprises at almost every single corner.An example of this that is very evident is the first level of the game.I'm not going to spoil it, but i'll just say that in the previous Souls games, the first levels were pretty good tutorials with fair enemies. It isn't like that in this one, you'll see what I mean if you play it.The new mechanics the game throws at you are a different, fresh, new experience.Stats are distributed differently, movement feels different, healing items are awful now, and enemies have different movesets. It's interesting to play, and in some aspects, much more difficult.I was kind of worried this game would be a casualized version of the first, I can say that I'm not dissapointed.Onto the technical aspects:The PC port is very good, a definite improvement over the first. Easy 1080p and 60 fps on an AMD 7850.I can't judge the Mouse+Keyboard controls though, because I haven't tried, but honestly, who would? A controller is a must for these types of games.Loading screens are almost non-existent just like the firstAlso, Alt+F4 is beautiful, try it out when you play it, it saves your game, fades out and exits - A counter against people that will quit during PvPSteamworks for this game is amazing! There is no ""summoning failed"" message like in the first, summoning and invading people are almost instant! The connectivity is nice and a great improvement over Games for Windows Live in the first Dark Souls.Overall, I'd recommend Dark Souls 2.It's decent, but I still like Demon's Souls the best.…"

As well as a strong enemy variety and well animated/telegraphed attacks allow you to see actual tactics being used.Enemies will charge at you when they see you healing, some of them can heal, and others can be baited into putting up their shield (if they have one) just by pulling out a ranged weapon.…"

It doesn't seem that hard yet, the biggest struggle I find is the fact that the controls are impossible to navigate when reacting to enemies. The main reason I die is because I can't control the character enough to react to the game itself which is the worst problem you can have for a game. Another obvious flaw is the fact that when your going through tutorial area in the beginning all of the helpful signs are still in console controls! So you can't even translate to what in the world I'm suppose to do on PC to get that to happen. They even have the menus in the game still on console controls.

That's what ""Dark Souls 2"" is.  Not only is it obviously a terrible PC port despite claims that PC was the lead platform (then why do enemies in the distance only animate at 30fps, why is the UI so obviously designed for console, why is M&K functionality still garbage?), but the game itself plays worse than a ""Souls"" game ever has.This is likely in large part due to this being the first ""Souls"" game that isn't made by the original ""Souls"" team.  If you need more info on this, google it, but bottom line is ""From Software"" felt that the ""Souls"" franchise had become successful enough that the people who made it good could do... whatever they're doing now, and the next entry (Dark Souls 2) could be made by ""From Software's"" B-Team.Playing as Melee is pretty much broken this time around, as enemy tracking is impossible to outpace.  In DeS/DS1, you could see them winding up for an attack and roll out of the way, but now they spin on a dime and do not stop their facing until their attack has landed.  So, instead of rolling when you see the attack coming, you have to roll during the window right before the attack lands, which is much, *much* more punishing, and *far* more difficult to execute.  DeS/DS1 were punishing but fair, DS2 is punishing for the sake of being punishing.Gone as well is the tactical one-on-one combat, not just because of the above, but because of the game's tendency to throw entire rooms of enemies at you at once.  In DeS/DS1, you could lure enemies off large packs to make them easier to handle, or if you alerted one enemy in the room you would only pull that enemy and *maybe* whoever was nearby.  In DS2, if you trigger on enemy, you trigger every enemy in the room.  This makes the focus on co-op much heavier, as you're going to *need* two other people around you spamming attacks just to clear more areas.The vast majority of boss fights are copy-pasted from DS1, and the ""new"" boss fights are just bosses that look new but use mechanics that anyone who's already played DeS/DS1 will immediately recognize.There's also the issue of item durability.  In this game, your weapons are going to degrade at a much faster rate, and the only way to restore them is to use extremely rare and highly expensive Repair powders, or resting at a bonfire.  This means that, more often than not, your favorite main-hand weapon is going to be rendered unusuable before you reach the next checkpoint.  There's also a bug in the game that makes it so swinging your weapon through enemies who are in the ""dying"" animation, or swinging your weapon and having it clip a co-op phantom, will cause it to degrade at 300% the rate as well.  These two combined make for a more naggy, OCD melee-combat experience.This is also the first time I've played a ""Souls"" game and felt like it needed a map.  ""Demon's Souls"" was split into 5 seperate worlds which made it easy to keep track of things in your head, ""Dark Souls"" was open world but everything fit together very cohesively so again it was easy to keep track of things.  ""Dark Souls 2"" feels like they threw a bunch of zones together and didn't care about how they connected to each other, they just wanted them there.  Navigating is an absolute chore.  It's entirely possible to be exploring your first time, and find yourself stuck in areas where the only way to get out is to die by jumping into a chasm/pit, or returning to a bonfire (with a spell or item).  ""DeS"" and ""DS1"" had *some* of this as well, but not nearly to the extent that ""DS2"" does.The ""Souls"" series is all about overcoming unpleasant surprises, but the only unpleasant surprise ""Dark Souls 2"" delivers is that of a mishandled entry in a beloved franchise, with the only feeling left afterwards being that of wasted time.  ""From Software"" decided they could save money by hiring lesser talent to make a game that'd get success by brand name alone.  And sales-wise, it probably worked, but from now I'm going to be far more leary when I look at the next title from ""From Software"".It's very disappointing to recognize what ""From"" has done here, because it means that the ""Souls"" franchise will never be as good as it used to.  Yet for how good the last two games were, there was still a lot of room for improvement, and now we'll never know how good this series could've been.  Like everything else, it comes down to the people in charge intentionally ruining something so they can increase their profit by a few percent.  Once that starts, there's no going back.  If they feel like they have ""f u"" money after just two big titles, then quality from here on out is only going to get worse for ""From"" titles.…"

By no means is different bad, in fact I think that's this games sticking point.  If it was too much like the first, I don't think it would have been as enjoyable for someone like me, who knows the mechanics inside out, upside down and backwards.  I feel like I'm new again, holding up my shield while slowly turning the next corner, and hoping not to come across some new trap.For all the hate it's getting for not being exactly like Dark Souls, I can agree with some of the points.  The weapons degrade at a shocking rate, although I am still early on (3 hours in) so who knows, upgrading may fix that.  And of course, we could discuss the lighting engine and all that fluff, but it's been said and done before.  We know it's not what was shown at E3 in 2013, nor what was in the beta, but whatever.  Although, I still feel that it's trying a bit too hard to give the lighting effects a chance, because nothing actually looks, you know, dark yet... Here's hoping The Gutter proves this point moot.Anyways, first impressions aside, I'm glad I purchased this game, and I plan on playing it for a good long time.

It's not an issue or a bug they need to fix nor is it ""clunky"", it's how they chose to implement multi-player into the game. Yes, the keyboard and mouse controls are terrible, but this is a studio that doesn't make PC games, Dark Souls was their first attempt at a port and Dark Souls 2 is their second. It blows that you have to use a controller to play the game comfortably but you don't HAVE to. I used  the PC controls for about 3 hours and while they are a bit odd and uncomfortable, the game is completely playable using keyboard and mouse. Now lets actually talk about the game.Now Dark Souls 2 is an amazing game, from the visuals to the gameplay, it stays true to the Souls series. The game looks brilliant and it's color palette is wonderful, they optimized the heck out of it and the game runs incredibly even with all the settings turned up to the max on mid-range PC's.I feel it's a bit harder than the first as well, and the main reason behind that is that weapons now degrade a lot faster. Enemies are more aggressive and bosses need a little bit more strategy than previous titles, more than once I have underestimated the enemy and in the end paid dearly for my mistake. Control responsiveness is great, never once have I been screwed over because my input didn't go through. The world you're in is amazing, the level design is just as good as Dark Souls 1, and the enviroment feels more immersive. My only one gripe is that your weapons break far to quickly, you can now equip three items to each hand, but that doesn't make up for it. It's really annoying how quickly you can get into trouble when your weapon breaks and you have to high-tail out of a fight. Not even upgrading your weapon improves it's durability. There is and item you can equip that you find later in-game that slows the degradation of you weapons, so that's nice, but I wish upgrading improved their durability. Dark Souls 2 is everything I hoped for in another Souls game, and anyone that says their a Souls fan and then says they were disappointed with this game is not a Souls fan.…"

I should start with s of this game. It is dark souls,  it has beautiful lore, awesome gameplay, magnificent views (my favourite location is Dragon Aerie), hardness and my favourite... you kill bosses and progress not with level or high damage sword, but with skill. Some bosses are unique and interesting. PVP or Jolly co-op is just awesome (after I defeat boss on my own, I like to help others). There are added tons of items and mechanics what make game better. And the ending is quite good.Now about cons. and I found only one big flaw what made me sad, it is bosses. The problem is, that there is too much knight bosses, and sometimes they even repeat. Few bosses are just copy/pasted from ds1(like scorpion lady(ds2) and spider lady(ds1)). Well I must admit that ornstein is copied for lore and his attack are different, so I wouldn't count him as flaw, but sometimes you just feel thet it's too familiar, in a bad way. Another con for bosses is hardness, you meat Persuer (just a knight) and this is your nightmare(and yes, only after I defeated him, I received an info of 90% easy damage, but the way I defeated him as knight was even better) . Then you meet an awesome dragon in cage and he dies from 10 hits or you meet Lord of Giants( who should be hard as hell and awesome in this way)... I killed him on 2nd try. And final boss wasn't **** but he/she was disappointingIn sum-up I can say, that this is great sequel, not perfect, but great one. If you just compare with what came out in 2013/2014 (bugged and not finished bf4, simcity, Rome:TW2 and others) DS2 is best right now you can get in 2014(for me). DS2 receive from me 8.5/10.

The world is incredibly well designed, and the game never holds your hand through anything. As you progress you get actually feel like you've accomplished something, and when you fail (which you will -- a lot) you need to exercise patience and sound strategy to overcome. I wish every game I purchased played out like that. The class creation system is deep and allows for tons of possibilities (kinda like how Blizzard games used to be before they determined everyone was too stupid to put points into attributes by themselves). And da 30+ boss fights and creature variation?... Awesome. Nearly everything about this game is excellent, reminds me of how action RPG's used to be and should be.9/10 Would Die Again…"
9,"When Dark Souls 2 was finally released in 2014, it set the stage for what would be considered ‘difficult’ in the gaming world, ironing out the unsavoury parts of its previous title and redefining difficulty in its challenging boss fights and pvp, rather than challenging environment and controls. Upon starting the game, the player is thrown into the tutorial area, which is littered withWhen Dark Souls 2 was finally released in 2014, it set the stage for what would be considered ‘difficult’ in the gaming world, ironing out the unsavoury parts of its previous title and redefining difficulty in its challenging boss fights and pvp, rather than challenging environment and controls. Upon starting the game, the player is thrown into the tutorial area, which is littered with secrets and Easter eggs for its more experienced players. Here, the player will learn how to parry, backstab and all the other skilful combat manoeuvres that made Dark Souls 1 so rewarding.Alongside a more refined gameplay, Dark Souls 2 is paired with a deep storyline to rival that of even Skyrim and similar titles, despite being completely separate from its previous title, both are still, unsurprisingly, set in the DS universe. The player begins as a cursed undead, doomed to remain between life and death forever and to eventually become ‘hollow’, a zombie-like being with no memories or purpose. In order to break this curse, the player is tasked with collecting four Great Souls from powerful ancient beings known as Old Ones, an undoubtedly daunting mission.The aesthetics of the game perfectly complement its lonely, harsh atmosphere, the graphics are very realistic and the fantasy element of the game is only really shown in the terrifying beasts and ghouls that face the player, even they are eerily realistic. As for the technical side, I did personally experience occasional framerate issues even on PC, let alone consoles at the time. I, however, did find the game very playable despite this.The loneliness of the game creates perfectly compliments its NPCs and artificial intelligence, in the sense that the player would rather be relieved by the company of anyone than have to go through the whole game alone. For example, by the end of the game most have become ridiculously attached to the being known as ‘snuggly’, who is never even actually seen in the game, though is assumed to be a crow-like humanoid and who’s character is developed through Easter eggs and adorably broken English.In summary, Dark Souls 2 is my personal favourite of the series, surpassing both its previous title and even its following title with unrivaled atmosphere and terrifyingly monstrous bosses.…"

7,"There's a lot to say about this game so I broke it down into three catagories: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. Skip to the bottom for a synopsis.The Good:+DaS2 is still huge. There is a lot to explore and there's plenty of hidden areas with tough bosses.+A larger, more open game world.+More character interaction. Much of the lore is fleshed out via NPCs as you journey throughThere's a lot to say about this game so I broke it down into three catagories: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. Skip to the bottom for a synopsis.The Good:+DaS2 is still huge. There is a lot to explore and there's plenty of hidden areas with tough bosses.+A larger, more open game world.+More character interaction. Much of the lore is fleshed out via NPCs as you journey through the game, with characters having more to say (and more to sell).+Better networking and better co-op. A new ring essentially makes your summon sign only visible to your friends.+More accessible covenants. While most covenants in DaS you had to jump through hoops just to find, overall DaS2's covenants are easy to join and more enjoyable to level.+Dual wielding is greatly improved. Power stancing lets you swing both your weapons in new combos.+Magic is greatly expanded and includes a new catagory for Hexes.+Greatly improved NG+ experience. Bosses drop new items, new enemies spawn in special areas, and some bosses gain new mechanics.The Bad (huge problems that will [probably] never change):-Terrible map design. Most levels are very simplistic, with some even being a straight corridor from beginning to the token boss.-Heavily unbalanced covenant rank-up requirements. Heirs of the Sun's 30 sunlight medals can be achieved in a few hours for max rank, while BoB & Blue Sentinel's 500 kills requires NG+ or nonstop victories in the arena (losses count as -1 rank points... why?).-Overabundance of forgettable, humanoid bosses. Some are recycled later in the game (or later playthroughs) as normal mobs or bosses. Many bosses have similar attack patterns and fall apart when you circle strafe and roll.-Swarms of enemies everywhere. While DaS focused on intense 1v1 fights, there were occasional cannon fodder slaughterfests. DaS 2 will regularly throw multiple heavily armored & long-reaching (polearms, ultra greatswords) enemies at you.-Parrying and riposting are harder to perform and less rewarding. Even if you manage to riposte, you can now be damaged while riposting by the swarms of enemies in DaS 2.-Overabundance of healing items and consumables. There's no reason to start as a Cleric because of 3 different purchasable lifegems (HoT consumable), 12 Estus Flask+5s (easily attained on first playthrough), and 8 other consumables that restore spells or cure statuses on top of healing you.-Terrible plot and story telling. The last few levels (and especially the ending cutscene) make no sense and it feels like the devs just wanted to add ""cool"" stuff to pad the game.The Ugly (nitpicking and balance problems):*Iframes have been removed from backstabs, ripostes, using fog gates, doors, and other environmental actions.*Roll iframes & estus flask drinking speed are tied to a stat.*No pyromancer starting class. You have to get roughly through one-quarter of the game to find your first flame and pyromancy and its very easy to miss.*Tons of balance issues with both PvE & PvP. Near the end of the first playthrough magic becomes very powerful, even in PvE. In PvP most spells worth using in PvP will kill you in 1 or 2 hits even with strong magic defense.*No un-cracked Red/Blue Eye Orbs and cracked orbs aren't sold by NPCs until NG+.*Changes to equip load mean everyone is some kind of hybrid class, doing normal rolls while wearing full Havels with a cloud of Persuers- err, i mean Affinity over them while waving a flaming katana around.*Cheaters are currently a huge issue on the PC version. You can now be invaded while Hollow and not being human is a big HP handicap, meaning you will run into cheaters much more often than in DaS.Dark Souls 2 isn't much of an honest sequel to Dark Souls; Being more akin to a numbered Final Fantasy sequel, with the only connection between the two being some equipment & spell names as far as I can tell. While it will win tons of GOTY awards, it also has a ton of issues that need to be addressed before it will be remembered as fondly as its predecessor. DaS 2 is definitely worth playing, but it feels like a rushed cash-in made by a B-Team who were told how a Souls game should be made (and then went and did their own thing anyway). Hopefully FromSoft's next Souls game has some actual soul to it... Otherwise we might just end up with another Armored Core situation with a new half-assed sequel being pooped out every few years.…"

The most annoying thing I have noticed is the lack of boss variation. Most of the bosses are some form of humanoid creature or knight. There is the big Jabba The Hut looking thing and also the rat king boss but other than that they are all the same. I beat 90% of the bosses by either strafing to the left or right because of this. If you some how could not beat a boss you could always summon the phantom NPC to help you which are there for most bosses and since it is really easy to stay human that option is always there and make the fight an almost guaranteed win. The dragons were just plain weak which was very disappointing. There really were no mini bosses that were a challenge. It seems the developers made it sound like it was going to be much more difficult to get more sales because it was definitely  not a challenge. The boss weapons were all crap. No point in even saving the boss souls for them because the ones that were good had some major flaw like the durability was low or something. Dying is not a big deal in Dark Souls II because you only lose a very small fraction of your health. On my third character I was able to make it through the entire game and only died about 7 times due to stupidity such as falling off a cliff or something. The conditions, such as poison or curse, barely do anything to even a character that is not resistant to them. On top of that the targeting system is jacked and rarely works how you want it to. The covenants are great if you love multiplayer but if you do not there are only a select few that will benefit you offline. With that being said there are a few things that were good about the game.One thing I thought was a major improvement was the PC controls. They are a little confusing at first but after a while of messing around with them it is just like playing any other game. The graphics are awesome and the developers did an amazing job on that but can also be scaled down far enough to work on a crap PC. The bonfire jumping, although it makes the game easier, I thought it was an improvement. There are also many easily missed secrets which may keep you interested through your second play through.I would rate the individual parts of the game as follows.Graphics 10/10Controls 9/10Gameplay 2/10Difficulty 1/10Multiplayer 5/10To sum this up I would say it is a fun game but if you want a true souls game play Demon Souls or the first Dark Souls because the developers like many others are just pumping these things out for money now.…"

I spent 100 hours+ with this game, played it till the end and still want to play more so I wouldThis is my revised review without playing DS1 before . At my first time play through, I gave this game 0 out of 10 because of terrible port. I almost ditched this game but on a second thought, I gave it another try by overlooking bad port and poor graphic. This time I really enjoyed the game. I spent 100 hours+ with this game, played it till the end and still want to play more so I would like you guys to read my review first, you will understand why this game has a lot of lovers and haters at the same time, and whether this game suits your taste or not.Let me start with the bad port first. As many negative reviewers said, this game has a abysmal console port EVER !. If you have controller, you will not have the issue. Nevertheless, if you have only keyboard + mouse, You will have to spend 1-2 hours  learning how to play with keyboard. Even after you know how to do every moveset, you still have a delay. Anyway,  you still can play this game with keyboard + mouse. Me too struggled at first but now totally fine.Second, the Graphic is unacceptable if you compare to PC RPG game nowadays. So even without keyboard issue, this game cannot get perfect score. No zooming to the face when you talk to NPC, NPC mouth is shut. Character creation is bare bone. Begining cinematic is a lie. You will not see cinematic like that again in the game. The only cinematics left are seen when you fight a boss, which most of them are mediocre.Third, there is a very little story in this game, or I could say this game has no story at all, no quest or whatever. You just have to put yourself through the end of the game, that's it. This game is pretty much like a hack&slash game if you ask me.However, even with these very poor features, this game still has its huge merit, that is THE CHARISMA of the game. or in another word, THE CHALLENGE, which is very unique if it is compared with most RPG games in the market. EVERY TIME YOU DIE, THE GAME WILL PUNISH YOU, this concept adds the unique tense that I never had before in other games. Every death will decrease your maximum HP 5 - 10% per time and If you die again before getting to the spot that you just died, you will lose all your souls accumulated, which can be a huge loss since you have to use souls to up your lv and spend stuffs. Of course, you cannot save your game. This rule will force you focus on the game and be cautious to every corner, traps and  enemy. ""I must survive ! I must not die"" these are what you will chanting in your mind while playing the game. There are checkpoints (bonfire) available though, however many times checkpoints are far from each other, so if you die along the way, you will have to run from the start again.Game Mechanic is also very awesome. I blamed it in my first review but that was because of my inexperience. This game when you click attack button, it means you just committed the attack, you cannot cancel it and you will be vulnerable at that time. This force you to play more carefully. Most of enemies in the game can be defeated only  by skill not by your lv or equipment.  You just need to understand its attack-pattern, dodge and attack at the right time. Boss's fights are so epic and super excited. I still remember how hard when I fought will Last Giant, the first boss and Pursuer, the second boss first time. I spent more than 2 hours to beat them. I died a lot, many times I made mistakes just when I was about to finished them off ( wanna cry). I even almost gave up. However, after I defeated them, I felt very satisfied. The feeling that you conquer the game on your own perseverance will emerge.To me, there is no game giving the winning feeling as big as this one.Multiplayer, another thing that I must mention no matter what. This game has a VERY GOOD MULTIPLAYER, which I've never expected from RPG games. PVE, you can summon your friends to help you fight or can go to help in your friend's world. Thus, if you feel like the game is too hard, you can summon help anytime. More importantly, PVP IS THE BEAST, fighting the others is very fun. A lot of weapon have its own moveset, making the fight very diverse. There is no best weapon nor best armor in the game. Moreover, you can invade the other's world forcefully by using items, ambush poor guy while he is busy with his monsters, or be invaded yourself, or even become a helper who helps newbie fight with invader. However, for me, in a high lv 200+, the game will start to be less fun in PVP since everyone will use the same style due to the stat  soft cap and soul mem matching is unreasonable.In sum, I have a lot of fun with this game but I cannot give perfect score because those bad aspects. So here is my quick brief reviewIF YOU WANT THE GAME WITH AN AMAZING GRAPHIC, EXCELLENT STORY that has various of choices and memorable NPC. This game is absolutely ์NOT for you.However, IF YOU WANT A INTENSE CHALLENGING GAMEPLAY and GREAT PVP, this game is a must try !. I hope DLC will come soon :>…"

First off, the gameplay is amazing.  I found myself sitting through late hours of the night mashing away at cruel and punishing enemies.  I died, ALOT.  But thats a part of the games appeal.  When you finally get through that tough boss that took you hours to finish, its one of the most rewarding experiences you will ever feel.  Besides the gameplay (which is near perfect), the lore is also a very interesting part of the game's story as well.  Dark souls 2 isnt direct with its story line at all.  In fact, the only way your going to  end up understanding most of the story behind different bosses, or the land of Drangilec, is by reading up on the history of specific  items and souls you get through the game.  You'll also be able to talk to different npcs during your playthrough.  The reason im not giving this game a perfect score is because doesnt feel all that original.  Many bosses, weapons, and even some different areas of the game all feel like they were almost copy and pasted from the original Dark Souls.  Also, the game doesnt always feel 100% fair like the first one did.  What i mean by this, is that in some areas of the game, you'll encounter enemies or bosses that'll slide and move in your direction as you try to evade.

A drastic improvement over Dark Souls 1, with better connectivity, quicker weapons and what I felt was a higher skill cap, due to the new parrying/backstab system. I am aware that there are some that think Dark Souls 1 PvP was superior, but for me, Dark Souls 2 really fixed the issues of Dark Souls 1 PvP.…"

When you are behind (and several in-game feet away from) a forward-thrusting spear-wielder, you shouldn't be taking damage. And it's **** like that, dying when your character is in an apparently safe space, that turns this from an educational exercise in patience, tactics, and the adrenaline rush of long-sought success -- into a cheap-ass dice roll, more akin to angry birds than either Souls game.…"

DLC делали другие люди (2), тут хоть сложный босс есть Сэр АлоннЛокацииЧто-то новое в плане локаций игра не превнесла, и, опять же, самокопирование. НО.. локации имеют ещё большую проблему.. ДС 1 был почти цельным миром с парой ответвлений, здесь же это куча ответвлений, без цельности. За прохождение ни разу не было ВАУ эффекта от шортката, возвращение в некоторые места в ДС 1 просто разрывало шаблоны, а тут куча срезов, которыми вы даже не воспользуетесь.. Очередной перебор с анусами подземелий, но тут хоть с наличием света проще. Одно радует - перемещение между кострами есть изначально и вам не нужно бегать 30 часов для получения такой возможности.ПерсонажиКолоритные NPC и забавные враги - забудьте, я был влюблён в людей-грибочков, из-за которых я когда-то купил ДС 1. Колоритом ни от боссов, ни от NPC тут и не пахнет, запомнился только Вождь Венгарл, но остальные..АчивментыОчень расстроило то, что я не знал, что нужно было обязательно призывать NPC фантомов на бои с боссами для получения пары ачивментов.
