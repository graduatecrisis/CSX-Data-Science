10,"Gameplay mechanics and combat are finely polished and highly enjoyable. Monolith has managed to capture the LORT world perfectly and paired it with Batman AC like gameplay. This is a must play if you're a fan of either, but the game stands out on it's own regardless if the obvious influences those games had on it.  Overall, an amazing game."
10,"Finally we have a LoTR game worthy of many hours of our time! Shadow of Mordor brings free roaming adventure and game changing new features together to make one amazing game.

Shadow of Mordor brings free roaming adventure and game changing new features together to make one amazing game. One of those games where you get lost in its mechanics and find yourself putting the story on the back burner. For me that's a good sign of a game with good longevity.Nemesis system is great, combat is satisfying and gory to boot. Story is there but I find myself making my own story to enhance the main one. RPG elements are there. I especially like how the weapons upgrade with ruins you collect off of war chiefs or other notable enemies. Graphics are great. There is not much tediousness that comes with the open world genre. You can fast travel pretty readily conveniently. But this is one of those worlds where I prefer to get lost in and take that short cut threw the woods.Even if you are not a fan of Lord of the Rings check this game out. It is an amazing game on its own.If you are a die hard Tolkeinite the lore should not be that blasphemous to you either.…"
9,"Ultimately, I think this game is worthy of all the praise that it has received thus far. As a full disclosure, I haven't quite finished the game, but I've finished nearly all of the story missions, and I'm cleaning up some of the side stuff, and I decided to write this while taking a break. So, bar an abysmal ending, this review should hold up.RPG MechanicsUltimately, I think this game is worthy of all the praise that it has received thus far. As a full disclosure, I haven't quite finished the game, but I've finished nearly all of the story missions, and I'm cleaning up some of the side stuff, and I decided to write this while taking a break. So, bar an abysmal ending, this review should hold up.RPG Mechanics----------------------------------------------------------------The first thing you need to know about this game is that nearly the entire focus of the game is on combat. When it comes to the actual RPG mechanics of this RPG, it's pretty light, honestly. You go about and kill things and find collectibles and etcetera to acquire EXP/currency to upgrade your abilities/weapons and there's also a rune system which are used to augment your character into some more specific roles. From my understanding, what runes you actually acquire from the Orc Captains are pretty random, but the ones I've gotten tend to rely on random chance more than anything else, just straight percentage rolls. Which is ultimately fine, as your character has another means of upgrading, via a skill tree system which actually has a good amount of variety/customisation. It's a tiered system (which makes sense) and the abilities actually impact the way you play the game rather than just provide you with a bunch of passive stuff.Combat----------------------------------------------------------------------------The actual combat in the game is very satisfying, albeit a bit easy. It takes cues from the Batman: Arkham series and just has a kind of freeflow combo system. A lot of games try to emulate this system, and a lot of games fail at this system. This game, fortunately, does the system well. The combat is very fluid and responsive and is generally very accurate. Also, the animation quality of this title is top notch, so moves flow into each other very well and your character looks completely natural while pulling off his extravagant combos. There is also a rudimentary stealth system that is functional, but very basic. You should not play this game in a stealth only approach, and if you do (if it's even possible), you are not very likely to have a lot of fun.Story-------------------------------------------------------------------------The story is pretty serviceable. It hasn't been anything that has been cringeworthy, it feels pretty in place in a Tolkien universe. I've read The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings trilogy, but I haven't read the other Middle-Earth stuff, but as far as I can tell, the game doesn't really reuse any plot devices from the books and everything feels natural. I've had a lot of fun with the own stories that end up getting created as you play the game via the Nemesis system where you form your own rivalries with orcs and orcs will fight amongst themselves and vie for power. If you get killed by an orc, that orc gets more powerful and becomes your nemesis and you get to go hunt him down for revenge. It creates context to the battles you're fighting and gives the enemies more personality. Also, the voice acting in this game is top notch.Technical things-----------------------------------------------------This game ran at a smooth 60 fps and, as far as I'm aware, didn't dip anywhere. The graphical fidelity is quite good (Full HD res even!), the texture quality was very consistent, and I didn't notice much of anything like texture pop-in, etcetera. The draw distance is quite far as well. In my playthrough, I did not notice any bugs or glitches. Once in a while there was some odd collision detection with the environment as you go for a stealth kill but outside of that, nothing.Conclusion--------------------------------------The game is fun, pure and simple. The Nemesis system is pretty innovative as it allows you to play games in the shadows where you pit orcs against each other. I wanted to talk more about that, but it's kind of hard to put into text, you might want to watch a video that'll give you more detail on that. I recommend TotalBiscuit's video on YouTube.I gave this game a 9 because later on in the game, things do start to feel a bit repetitive. Unfortunately, I think that is just something that's inherent to the combat system and the game is very combat focused. Do not buy this game if you do not like the Arkham style combat system. Also, the game won't really present you with much of a challenge, which disappointed me a bit. One other gripe with this game is that there are a couple forced stealth sections, they are few in number but it's, y'know, a slap in the face to player choice and agency.When all is said and done though, I quite enjoy this game. It feels in place with Tolkien works and the combat mechanics are responsive, fluid, and fun while adding a bit of innovation to the genre via the Nemesis system. Also, the production values are top notch, truly an AAA title.Monolith is back to form.…"
10,"This game is amazing, such a new and refreshing experience!. And also its 60 FPS 1080p! Excellent graphics, gameplay, voice acting, story, music etc. I can't find anything negative about this game so I'll give it a 10/10. Get this game NOW!"
10,"This is a huge Game of the Year contender. I find myself struggling to get sucked into and pull value out of games these days, but I started playing Shadow of Mordor last night and only stopped 11 hours later. I haven't done that since I was in college, and all I can think about is going home later to keep playing. The nemesis system is really incredible.

10,"With some issues aside, which I hope will be patched soon, the game stands to its hype. Extremely fun combat, with awesome visuals and not to mention the much loved world setting of Middle-earth, which I'm sure even non-Tolkien fans will rejoice. This is a RPG that I cannot wait to delve further into."
5,"A creative Nemesis system along with a Batman-ish style combat system which will entertain you for a few hours.  However, soon the enjoyment dies down and becomes a repetitive button smasher.  Try before buy."
9,"Easily the best game in Lord of The Rings Universe ever created! Fantastic combat system with top notch animation brings you the enjoyable gameplay experience! Fairly big open world with engaging story and side missions! And the best thing about it, innovative Nemesis system that creates emotional connection to your enemies! MUST BUY"
10,"This is a very very fun game...I was expecting it would turn out to be a 7 rated game but never thought it would turn out 9.5 to 10.  Stop reading and play this... your missing out....Ignore the negative reviews from AC fans....."
9,"Very different from any game I have played before.Much more to do other than the main story. Filled with content.Graphics are top notch on the ps4.Only problem I have with this game is that the game play itself can get a bit repetitive."
6,"VERY REPETITIVE !  Go there, kill enemies, win experience and repeat. Go there, kill enemies win experience and repeat ...Combat system stealed from Batman videogame, parkour system stealed form Assasins Creed. Nothing really exiting about nemesis system. The game is ok, wait and buy it for 30 € or less."
2,"The game feels like a poor Assassin's Creed rip off.The camera is so bad that it becomes a challenge in itself. If you fight near a wall it completely goes crazy and points to random directions. It reminds me of old N64 games.The stealth mechanics are bad. It's an open world most of the time, so the enemies just have super small sight.

If you fight near a wall it completely goes crazy and points to random directions. It reminds me of old N64 games.The stealth mechanics are bad. It's an open world most of the time, so the enemies just have super small sight. You can kill 3 enemies stealthly when they are all side by side and nobody notices. It's made to look like you are stealth, but in fact I think they found out that in LoTR orcs are deaf and have very poor vision. Also, there is no ""go behind the wall mechanics"", so when you go close to a wall, the camera focus on the wall and the controller gets clumsy (since you can't walk by the wall).Combat mechanics are a bit better, but still clumsy. Fighting has lots of button smashing and the player moves in random directions sometimes. To compensate for the easiness of button smashing, the game throws tons of monsters at you at the same time. This changes the mechanic into: button smashing, run far from everyone (which you do faster than them anyway), wait for them to come in line, button smashing and repeat. Also, the bow mechanic is worse than Tomb Raider. The only ok point of the combat system is that you don't have to actually switch weapons (press square you use the sword, press R2/L2 you use the bow).The open world part seems to be ok so far and the nemesis/famous orcs part works well. The respawn system is very aggressive (more than Destiny, for example). It means it is virtually impossible to get rid of all orcs in an area before killing the big guys. You kill a bunch of them, walk 15 steps, look back and there are more of them again. The only way to clear an area is killing the bug guys. It is designed like this because the fighting is very easy 1vs1.…"

Without going into deep narrative, many items are found and characters are met throughout Mordor that tells the Silmarillion up to the events beginning The Lord of the Ring.

The characters aren't top-notch realistic, yet the graphics, animation look great, especially in 1080p.  The combat is more like Batman than like AC, although it does borrow AC's scaling walls as well as the rooftop strikes, but you level up your combat combos and skills like the Batman Arkham games.  But, this game goes beyond what Batman offers in the combat scheme as the addition of ""Wraith"" skills makes combat something incredible to see once you get all the nuances down.  The ""nemesis"" system is an awesome innovation that I would love to see more open world games utilize.  I found myself getting caught up more in cleaning out orc strongholds and bending a makeshift army to my will, then searching out the story line in this open world. Sadly, while there is an emotional charged story, with both Tailon and Celebrimbor as your duel protagonists, it never really comes across compelling enough to get caught up in.  Such as shame, because the voice acting and animations are very well done.  And the last sad thing about this game is the final end battles with Sauron's servants that were very anti-climatically done.  Think Tomb Raiders last game disappointing boss battle.  But even with those issues,  I found myself engrossed in the world of Mordor and quite a willing participant to rid Middle Earth of orcs in flourishing style.…"

9,"I really enjoyed this game, its everything I hoped it would be when first seeing it. The gameplay is reminiscent of Assassins Creed (free-roam, free-climbing) and Batman Arkham Asylum (combat), but it very much feels different.

Even when you're completely leveled up its still possible to swamped by so many Orcs that even as a badass ranger you never truly feel safe in Mordor, this is especially true at the beginning of the game. The story was also really good as well, although at times it felt a bit thrown together (you can approach certain missions in whatever order you want, so branching side-stories can feel lost in the overall narrative). My only major gripe is that after the campaign is finished the side missions (archer, sword, dagger and outcast missions) dont have enough variety to sustain 5-10hrs of grinding. It would have been good if cut-scene side-missions were available or the side-missions already in place had more variety and better objectives.…"
6,"Something's missing. This game is all about combat and it's very repetitive. It's not bad but I got tired really quick (didn't finish). Also, reading other reviews made me think graphics were incredible. They are not."

I don't like Lord of the Rings lore... I even hated it, but if you like epic games and Orcs (specially killing them) you won't be able to stop playing this. Also there are lots of collectibles and additions to complete. One of the most interesting things is also the way Sauron's army has its own living hierarchy. For an instance, if you die at the hands of an Orc boss, he will be rewarded with a higher Rank and you will see this in a screen that shows the current army's status, but also other Orcs can kill between them or the recently upgraded ones, taking their ranks. These things make them more powerfull, and is fun to find one who killed you in past again, and get revenge when he is suposed to be more powerfull and brags about thart fact. Also, there are many different ways to kill your enemies or create distractions... to mention one, you can just stay at distance and shot arows to free jailed beasts, and watch how they eat them all... or also runaway to avoid been eaten too! Brilliant!…"
10,"Taking into consideration some of the other major reviews, for example ""IGN"" and ""GameSpot"", I have to agree that the campaign, even though it is interesting to experience since it involves more of the lore of ""Middle Earth"", it is not the game's strongest factor/component. That does not necessarily mean that it disappoints, but that it leaves you wanting more. You get this feeling thatTaking into consideration some of the other major reviews, for example ""IGN"" and ""GameSpot"", I have to agree that the campaign, even though it is interesting to experience since it involves more of the lore of ""Middle Earth"", it is not the game's strongest factor/component. That does not necessarily mean that it disappoints, but that it leaves you wanting more. You get this feeling that the main story messes up what you already know from either the books or the movies (most common). My personal ""Story"" score would be a 7 or 8 out of 10. Of course, this game received good critic from major reviewers for a reason, and that reason is everything else excluding the ""Main Story"" of the game. This includes the fantastic gameplay with your epic sword, your ghostly bow, and finally your brutal stealthy dagger. Even more fun are the abilities that you have from being a ""Wraith"" where you are tremendously fast and blow you opponents heads off continuously. It is extremely fluid and responsive in every situation. There is nothing else to say about the gameplay since it is difficult to understand just from a review how impeccable it really is. This game was created, in my opinion, to introduce the ""Nemesis System"". Even though it is really easy to understand what it is doing while playing the game, I will just say this: Every kill you make, counts. Every kill your opponents make, especially counts! You could be fighting some random ""Uruk"" while exploring Mordor, and something happens and leads to your death. The random (could had avoided death) Uruk that killed you will now become a ""Captain"" and all the other ""Captains"" will increase there level. The thing is that if you are not careful while playing, and are constantly dying, the ""Captains"" can become a huge issue, getting into a point where they are totally harder than a ""War-chief"" (Commander of Captains). You might not understand what this means (not until you get the game), but basically keep in mind that you receive rewards to upgrade Talion , but think of his deaths as a ""Double-Punishment Treat"". You can always be able to kill even the hardest opponent, but don't expect it to be as easy as you might think since at that point, they will be invulnerable to simply everything.To conclude my simple review for ""Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor"", I say that it always falls down to you (reader of my review) whether or not to buy the game, maybe you're not into games like this, or maybe this game has made things difficult for in terms of how the game it-self is made up. I will have to admit though that when I bought the game I was not entirely sure I made the right choice for giving away $60, but after while, I realized that the game is unique in it's own, specific way and has come out to bring a different sense/feeling of gameplay compared to anything else out there in the market. It has come out to intrigue ""Gamers"", who are looking for something different in terms of game development.…"

It's smooth and beautiful and a great step up on the next gen consoles. The nemesis system is incredible, within 2 hours I had been killed 6 times by one foolish uruk who made his way up the ranks, eventually I got revenge, only for him to come back with a face wound and for our battle to continue. It creates small stories and power struggles within the game and I absolutely love it. Overall Shadow of Mordor is an incredibly fun experience, though it is not without flaw and so much more could be done with it, I would highly recommend it. I look forward to more games following in the footsteps of this one…"

I enjoyed every bit of the game.With Shadow of Mordor it seems Warner finally found the right formula to make great Lord of The Rings games, they still have to build on it, particularly increase the diversity in the game and not the same generics characters and story.…"

The cool little Gollum missions and moments like riding a catagor seemed few and far between, as opposed to walking from point a to point B trying to kill an endless supply of respawning orcs who taunt you if they kill you. And those boss orcs are either randomly easy (die to a single headshot, can be stealth killed) or resist everything (can't be stunned, can't be flipped over, invulnerable to ranged attacks...)

The true fun is in the nemesis system.Gameplay: This game plays just like the Batman Arkham games, with a smooth free-flow combat system based around achieving combos and using various abilities. However, the nemesis system adds a whole new dimension to this game. Each uruk is unique--even the lowly grunts. Each one has the potential to rise and fall (die) in the ranks, develop new traits (weaknesses, strengths, etc.) based on their experiences, and also be your tool of manipulation. The real fun is choosing uruks that you enjoy and dominating them--this allows you to begin building your own line of uruks, having them train and gain power, get close to your target, or strike at other uruk leaders. If you like the combat of the Batman Arkham games, you will enjoy this combat, which includes the excellent gore and crude violence missing from Batman, as well as some great differences to make it its own.Graphics: While I felt like the main character (Talion) had a weird appearance to his face, you are usually over his shoulder so it is not often in view. Everything else looks fantastic. Not quite up to the current-gen standard, but clearly at the cross-gen peak.This game is a whole lot of fun.

8,"Very good game. I love the combat system as the battle can get intense and it is lot of fun. I just which there was more things to explore in the world. A little bit more from Skyrim kind of thing, something else than just collection writing for the wall and the memory thing . Sometimes it gets too repetitive."

Story is awful, which is the reason it didn't get a 10 but man , am I glad they finally made a LOTR game thats good and not consist of Lego.Any reviewer rating this beyond 7/8 is a joke and has some emotional reason to not give it an honest rating. Get this."

Just to continue playing against war cheifs and captains? That is fun and all but the final point is so that my character would be strong enough to face the final boss. I mean that's the point right?

9,"This game is a breath of fresh air for the PS4. With the multitude of ridiculous ""HD remakes"" plaguing this system (i.e. GTA4, TLOU) along with the lack of new titles, this game has put a step in the right direction for current-gen gaming.

While it is obviously taking inspiration from Assassin's Creed and the Arkham series of Batman, it is a FUN game. While some people think it's a rip off or boring, I would say that it takes inspiration from other games and makes it their own. The nemesis system is incredible while being super frustrating and rewarding. I remember going back to specific warchiefs and captains AFTER I've beaten the game to test myself.Having said all this, the story is interesting and works well within the LoTR universe. The graphics are fantastic and I only imagine they look even better on PC (sorry, PS4 fans...it's true). The combat speaks for itself with it being very fluid while sometimes button-mashy, but fun in its own right. There's a lot of ways to make your character OP, but if one were to completely dismiss the strategy of runes, stealth, attacking enemies' weaknesses, you're going to be in for a frustrating time. That's the one thing I do enjoy about this game. With Batman or Assassin's Creed, if you were powerful enough, you could just go all ""guns-blazing"" and make it out alive. With ""Shadow of Mordor"", you have to use some strategy and some wits, otherwise, you'll be dead before you know it. For that reason, this game gets a 9.I'm looking forward to more games within this series. A great new series from Monolith.…"
8,"Shadow of Mordor is a hybrid between a sandbox and Arkham-style brawler that is set in the famous land of Mordor, in which you play as Talion, a ranger from the black gate who is brought back from the dead, after having his family slaughtered in front of him, by a wraith who had forgotten his past (I would just outright say who he is but I don't want to spoil, even if it is completelyShadow of Mordor is a hybrid between a sandbox and Arkham-style brawler that is set in the famous land of Mordor, in which you play as Talion, a ranger from the black gate who is brought back from the dead, after having his family slaughtered in front of him, by a wraith who had forgotten his past (I would just outright say who he is but I don't want to spoil, even if it is completely obvious who he is).I think I speak for many of us, Tolkein fans and traitors alike, when I say that expectations for Shadow Of Mordor were rather low, it both being a movie/book tie in game and a Lord Of The Rings game, which (unless you count that one RTS game which I thought was kind of good) are both historically **** or at least not really that good, largely due to heavy pandering to the fans by focusing exclusively on accuracy and completely forgetting that video games are supposed to be fun. Either that or the other way round where the devs don't give a rat's arse for the fans, or humanity in general, and end up creating an abomination which even the flaming pits of hell wouldn't admit to creating.However Shadows miraculously avoids this and manages to both be a fun game while at the same time expanding on the franchise, though it is non-canon so I suppose it matters little regardless.While we're on the topic of fun, my oh my is Shadows fun, it manages to blend elements from Assassin's Creed and Arkham games rather effectively while at the same time adding in some fresh ideas of it's own. The best singular example of this would be the much lorded Nemesis system, which allows you to look into and target the more powerful Orcs within the Orc hierarchy itself and once intel is gathered, learning their weaknesses and strengths so as to make the task of murder much more successful and that's only the beginning, it gets even better when you insert your own mind-controlled orcs into the mix later on in the game.Also when it comes to murder, SOM gets a big fat check from me, as the combat and the enemies are both fun, intuitive and interesting, I especially like both the fantastic voice-acting and the way that the head orcs (to put it simply) recognise and talk to you, for example if you made them flee last fight you had with them, then they will reference that when they talk to you, which adds a much more personal feel to the Uruk, who by the way are all randomly generated, so everyone will have their own War-chiefs to square off against.So let's talk about environments, the land of Mordor is quite ""next-gen"" on the PS4 as it looks pretty despite being so desolate, also for those worrying that Mordor will be another generic dark bland sandbox needn't worry as there is also another, more lush part of Mordor to explore, so despite the sandboxes being kind of pokey when we compare them with other games, they still are interesting and have plenty to explore within them.So all in all a solid game, which though is hardly revolutionary manages to be fun and even at times half-way intelligent with it's interesting characters, that in it's whole, I cannot complain too much about, though if you don't like killing orcs and doing little much else, avoid it like the plague, otherwise I recommend this to everyone. (Unless you're a **** killjoy who can't handle one minor inaccuracy within the mythology, in which case what are you doing here? There's a new hobbit movie to complain about)…"

The stealth gameplay reminds me of Assassin's Creed games with a lot of the same movements. The stealth missions aren't too long thankfully. Orcs seems to be fairly blind though, allthough this allows for a better gameplay experience overall with more freedom  of movement.Graphics: Not much to note here if I'm honest. It looks great (depending on your rig). Pushes the bar just a little bit higher and still runs well while doing so. Make sure you get the HD package after installing.Replayability: That's where the downside of this game kicks in. It felt short. I completed the entirity of this game (side missions, collectibles, weapon legends, etc.) in 21 hours. For a modern third person action game that's a respectable time. Still it felt way too short for me and the main storyline consists of 20 missions which only tell a threadbare story. The entire time I was playing I felt like I was playing in an enclosed enviroment. Just a teeny, tiny bit of what could be a huge world. Some of the final missions were just to wrap up the story line and felt like the designers didn't know where they could go anymore. And a quick-time event for the final scene just seems like a waste to me.Conclusion: An overall very good game which is certainly worth buying if you're into fast paced action in a good looking world. You might at times feel claustrophobic within the confined walls of the two zones, but there's plenty to do in this secluded space of MIddle-Earth. If the above is not true for you than I'd suggest waiting till the price drops to 25 euro's/dollars or so before picking this up. As far as the storyline goes you're not missing anything by not buying this title.…"

The combat system is excellent and there is nothing more rewarding than decapitating an orc and watching his fellow soldiers running to the hills in shock and dismay.. A mention has to go to the Nemesis system which a totally new experience and is constantly in the back ground. You take down a captain then another orc is promoted they may get to war chief only to be beheaded in the future. The graphics are vibrant and detailed and always a joy to look at.

The camera might sometimes be a little off but never to an annoying point or that it hampers your view or fighting ability.And even though anything but the main missions is repetitive (kill uruks, free slaves, kill warchiefs) there is a certain addiction to doing the challenges, duels and interrupting a recruitment attempt by Uruk warchiefs. Especially when things get personal (they have killed you and brag about it, throw insults at you or run away to fight you another time) it is very satisfying to walk across half of Mordor to get that bastard and finish him off. The sheer hatred you feel when a cowardly warchief stabs you every time in the back when you are already in a fight and kills you for the 3th time that way (all the while growing in power) I have not experienced before.The abilities work all very well and give you more options to make a battle a whole spectacle.I just had hoped there would be a bit more diversity in your enemies/world, like Haradrim or Easterlings. Maybe that will be something for expansions? And my worry is that when you are fully levelled up you become a bit to godlike which takes away the thrill of the fight or hunt.My only complaint is that not everything is explained very well. You learn the most from doing immediately the main missions but somehow they throw you out there in the open world without much explaining.…"

8,"Shadow of Mordor could be epic, and most of the time feels like its heading in that direction, but then....just isn't. The game does a lot of things right, and a lot of things that other games don't do. To judge a book by its cover Shadow of Mordor looks great, and once you dive in it is great. However, the game is held back later on by a lack of impact and replayability.Shadow ofShadow of Mordor could be epic, and most of the time feels like its heading in that direction, but then....just isn't.

However, the game is held back later on by a lack of impact and replayability.Shadow of Mordor looks great. I wasn't blown away by the technical prowess of the graphics, but everything looks sharp. The character models are well done, combat animations are fun to watch and the world looks, for the most part, realistic. The blood and guts gore adds to the oppressive tones of the title, though does go a bit far. Its only the second time my wife has asked me not to play a game in front of her (the other being the original The Darkness). There are plenty of games out there I wouldn't play in front of children, but there are far fewer I wouldn't feel comfortable playing with other adults around, and this one crosses that line at times. The gore isn't sadistic nor necessarily over the top, but it is frequent and bloody. The voice acting and sound are solid and add to the experience. There were no characters or enemies that sounded out of place or had poor acting, and the main cast was solid from start to finish. Overall, a solid start to finish presentation that won't blow you away, unless you love seeing gore, but has a high floor that doesn't disappoint.The gameplay is where the game shines. The combat is fun, fluid and gets better as you level up so it doesn't stagnate. I would compare the gameplay favorably to the Batman Arkham series (which I enjoy) but my friends equate it to the Assassin's Creed games (which they enjoy). As you level you gain a sense of power slowly but surely. Where a few weak enemies early in the game would quickly kill you, by the end of the game you are able to easily dispatch even the most powerful enemies you come across. The world is easy to navigate and rarely becomes frustrating, save for the times you want to just get a certain collectible but have to cut through a horde of enemies to collect it. The stealth is fun, if a bit clunky. Once you figure the system out it becomes simple to stealth through areas sniping enemies with the bow, but there's always that sense of suspense as a horde of enemies can come crashing down if you make a wrong move. The minigames are varied and fun, ranging from stealth assassinations to last stand type situations with your bow to freeing prisoners through whatever means are available. They can become frustrating later on in the game as there are no checkpoints, so if you fail you have to start over. This can be even worse for the stealth minigames as you can make a mistake so easily.This may be a small spoiler, but to anyone who has watched a trailer for the game you will know the end goal of the game is army building. To take over Sauron's army by controlling their minds and turning them against him. This was what made me want to play the game so badly. Be able to build an army and take it into combat. It's extremely fun and rewarding to find the captains you want and take control of them. You are then able to assist them on the missions they undertake, much like you are able to hinder enemy captains as they undertake missions. The problem is it doesn't really do you a lot of good. Yes, it's fun to get into a brawl and have an ally captain come with his small group of soldiers to aid you, but the problem is that it's not really all that useful. Captains will be where they are and you can't command them anywhere else. And the commands you can give them are very limited and don't allow for a lot of strategy beyond trying to position captains you control to become a warchief. Once they are warchiefs they become slightly more useful, but only as a means to kill off enemy captains. The one really annoying hiccup I did run into with the system was if you control enough captains the game feels hollow, as there aren't anything besides basic enemies to fight and not a lot to do with the captains you do control. Army building is extremely fun and rewarding until you realize that it's not really all that useful in the grand scheme of the game, though by that point you'll be powerful enough to rip through any enemy that comes across you. You have an army, which is fun, but it's an army that just wanders around.Shadow of Mordor is fun, rewarding and does a lot of things right. The floor is high as everything is done well. Unfortunately there are enough issues to keep the game from being epic. I would equate Shadow of Mordor to a book that draws you in, makes you want to keep going, makes you invested in the characters and then just....kind of peters out. The game is spent doing a lot of fun things, that make you invested in what's going on, only to surprise by just kind of ending without great resolution or impact.…"
8,"A very strong and engaging experience, mostly.The story is a tad weak in driving the game, however, things like the Nemesis system constantly push the world forward.

Yes, the world could be a little bit bigger, but the designers did a great job of balancing the size with the large amount of enemies all over the map.Randomly running into an officer was also an exciting experience.  Once, while I was fighting one (in order to gain intel about the warchief) I was met by 4 others.  Suddenly, a small battle turned into a large one with 5 officers and about 30 other orcs.  The game is full of exciting moments like that.The leveling system and customization also perfectly match the length of the campaign and size of the world.  At no point did I feel like I leveled too quickly or not enough.A feature that would have been nice is a difficulty setting.  I found that when I beat the game, even though I thoroughly enjoyed it, I had no urge to go back again.  If I could set it on a harder difficulty, I definitely would have given it another go.My biggest issue, besides the weak story, is the final battle of the game.  It is essentially a 30second QT event, which really rubbed me the wrong way.  They had created such a great and exciting experience up until those final moments.All in all, I think this one is definitely worth your money and time.  If your looking for an RPG action fix this is it.  Oh yeah, and the added bonus is that is J.R.R Tolkien.…"
8,"Assassins Creed meet Shadow of Mordor. The stealth is not as good as AC.

9,"Fantastic game, thoroughly enjoyed from start to finish, There are a few tweaks the developers could have made, for instance the ending / final battles were very disappointing.Hopefully this is a start to a successful chain of games, each improving like the Assassins Creed games"
8,"First, I'm gonna discuss all the things the game does right. #1 Presentation. No other LOTR game has come close to capturing the grandness that is Middle-Earth. SoM does so perfectly. It's extremely detailed from top to bottom. Although the graphics aren't the best in terms of next-gen, the art direction surely makes up for it. There are also tons of collectibles that have their own back story which you can read (and/or listen to) in the lore menu which is pretty cool #2 Voice acting. Troy Baker gives a great performance as Talion. He gives Talion a bad-ass vibe while at the same time, is able to draw  sympathy from players. My personal favorite performances are Alastair Duncan as The Wraith or Calabrimbor, Phil Lamarr as Ratbag and Liam O'Brien as Gollum. #3 Combat. Combat here is excellent. It's basically a carbon copy of the combat from Rocksteady Arhkham series only 10x more violent which is definitely not a bad thing. You have one button to strike, one to counter, one to dodge and one to stun. The more you strike enemies, the more you fill up your combo meter and once the meter reaches a certain level, you can unleash a brutal combat finisher to change the flow of battle. The stronger Talion becomes, the more combos you can unlock by completing various story missions or side quests. The stealth is a little clunky but it's sufficient enough for players to use it from time to time and you may need to use it early on because it gets rather challenging if you're fighting dozens or orcs at the same time. Finally #5 the Nemesis System. This is a unique system which I found myself being addicted to. The Nemesis system is basically a hierarchy of  Sauron's army of infinite orcs. This is what separates SoM from other open-world action games. When an orc captain kills you, he instantly gets promoted and becomes stronger. This will also happen if even a no name/ no ranking orc kills you, that orc will INSTANTLY become a captain with his own gang. Each captain has his own list of strengths and weaknesses and if they have more of the former and less of the latter, you're gonna have a tough time especially with captains who are virtually invincible to all of your attacks. This gives substantial meaning to your deaths and you always feel like you're getting more experience even in death. But it's not all kill or be killed. As you progress, you unlock more things to with orcs if you defeat them. For example, I ""branded"" one orc captain and commanded him to become a bodyguard for a warchief. After I confronted the warchief, I commanded that captain to betray him and literally stab him in the back. This didn't bode well for the warchief because as it turned out one of his weaknesses was ""fear of betrayal"" which gave the upper hand. Not only that but events can still happen with or without your presence. Like say two captains fight each other for a spot as Elite Captain or one captain plans an ambush against another to take his place. This can all without your character ever being there. It's things like these that make SoM feel more dynamic and alive and I hope that this Nemesis System can be applied for future open-world action titles.Now that all the good is out of the way, let's get to the bad. #1 The Story and (most of) the Characters. The story is short. Too short which is very ironic seeing as this is a game based on the LoTR franchise and we all know that the franchise is known for its lengthy stories and even lengthy subplots. Without doing side quests. You can finish the main story in about 5-6 hours and it's also a bummer that most of these main story missions feel like side quests because they're so similarly structured. Also, Talion is not a very engaging protagonist. I see the writers were going for a more tragic Aragorn-ish like hero but it just doesn't work out. Calabrimbor is probably the most interesting character in the entire game and rightfully so since he is the creator of the Rings. Other than him, 2 characters stick out in my mind, Gollum and Ratbag. We all know who is Gollum is by this point and he still steals the show whenever he appears so that's great but the real surprise character is Ratbag the Coward. He's an orc that decides to help you as long as you help him climb the ranks. A ""scratch my back and I'll scratch yours"" kind of thing. He's just so funny. From his dialogue to his mannerisms, he makes an impact whenever he shows up in the missions. It's a shame that he was so unceremoniously and abruptly killed. Everyone else feels bland. Nobody else is really fleshed out. I don't even remember their names anymore. That's how forgettable the other characters were. #2 Boss Battles. They were so anticlimactic. The final 2 important battles were so disappointing. You kill them with QUICK TIME EVENTS. THEY WERE SO BORING.Overall, I liked Shadow of Mordor. It has its issues but I can't deny how addicting the combat and the unique Nemesis System is. Definitely the best LoTR game so far.…"

The nemesis system adds a new dynamic to the game, and punishes players who go in to kill war chiefs or captains without gathering Intel to learn said captain/war cheifs strengths and weaknesses before hand. It was also a lot of fun to play the political game of turning orcs against each other so they are aligned to you and then plotting the demise of a war chief. The fun part about that is you can convert all of a war chiefs captains to your side and then challenge the war chief. The look on his face when he walks in to take you on, feeling good about himself because he has 4 captains with him but then realizes they are going to kill him. Priceless.In the open world, I like how the orcs are just going about their business rather than being placed their just to take you on.Story wasn't too bad and had some good moving moments, but don't expect a deep story from this gameThere are few minor design issues; free running seems clunky in a few places. The end game is really easy once you have your abilities unlocked, and while that made for some fun killing, it kept me away from playing the game once I finished it (everything just became to easy). Once I was done with the main quest, I went back to kill some orc captains who killed me earlier in the game when I had no idea of what I was doing and who became very powerful as a result.

Yes please, more please. I had a great time with the game.The combat and gameplay mechanics are very fluid and clean. You definitely feel very powerful as you progress through the game, and the fighting sequences are a ton of fun.The Assassin's Creed-feel to the game comes in the way the map is set up with several collectible-esque things to find, as well as the towers revealing the map. I thought they did it in good taste though with the collectibles needing a little mini challenge to be completed to get some of them, which was always fun.Attacking the orc generals was a very cool part of the game. I found myself posting up high and watching the orc camps for as long time planning out my attack. The weaknesses and strengths added just enough to make the need for some strategy necessary, which I liked.I did however find the orc mind control a little disappointing. The game advertised orcs that would always remember you and that you could mind control and shoot up the hierarchy so you could control an army of orcs. This mechanic wasn't even available until later in the game, and wasn't quite as in depth as I thought going into it, but this is really my only issue with the game.In closing, the LOTR fan will love this game, and any fans of the Assassin's Creed or Batman series' could definitely get into it. The game offers a lot in story and amazing gameplay. Definitely a recommended game.8.9/10…"

The setting is good but I felt it was a bit repetitive, there is only 2 areas which are kind of different but at the same time similar; I know it is Mordor…and I know it is supposed to be kind of monochromatic but still you can spend quite a lot of hours playing this game and, in my opinion, the map is a bit repetitive and kind of empty (compared e.g. to GTAV). The final boss is a bit disappointing. Good stuff, the action gameplay is good, some people say it is repetitive but, in my opinion it only is if you want it to be. Let’s face it, the game is easy, and it is quite easy to just say I’ll go around just swinging my sword and it’ll be fine that’ll do. However, there are quite a decent number of different skills and different ways of killing the war chiefs (e.g. direct approach, poisoning grog, taking advantage of a mutiny or what scares them, possession etc.).  So, yes you can make this game really simple and repetitive if you want and go CBA, but it is potentially varied in the ways you can approach your enemies and if you take advantage of that you’ll have a lot more fun. Finally, the story is not awesome, but it is all right, good enough.…"

8,"Story - The game begins on the time when the black captains used Talion and his family as blood sacrifice in order to summon and use Celembrimbor, but due to unforeseen events, Celebrimbor possessed the body of Talion which resurrected him and together must work together to get vengeance against the black captains. The story overall is a bit cliche but interesting main characters as wellStory - The game begins on the time when the black captains used Talion and his family as blood sacrifice in order to summon and use Celembrimbor, but due to unforeseen events, Celebrimbor possessed the body of Talion which resurrected him and together must work together to get vengeance against the black captains. The story overall is a bit cliche but interesting main characters as well as supporting characters and cameo appearances saves it. esp. Celembrimbor which is the most interesting character in the game. A score of 7/10.Gameplay - The gameplay is a mix of Arkham series (fighting) and the assasin's creed series (platforming and exploration), despite it lacking creativity, it is still executed properly and without major or significant problems. But the strength of the game doesnt really revolves on those but to its nemesis system, an advanced gameplay mechanic in which you control using wraith powers the Uruk officers in game and use them to wreck havoc against their fellow Uruks. Such an amazing feat added in game and is the main reason why the game is really good. The only and biggest weakness i have for this game also is in this aspect, which is the very bad boss fight...I wont spoil it to you, but all boss fights in game are bad and unremarkable in that regard. Still though, Ill give it a great score of 9/10 due to that unique nemesis system.Graphics - This game is also one of those which was released both in the last and current gen consoles and is also in my opinion looks significantly better in the current consoles. The environments are good like the dead world of the first map and the greenish and more alive world on the second map, with regards to the design and layout, the overall map is small and can be easily covered. Its not a minus though. As to the character design, overall, i really liked it. From Talion's rugged image to Celembrimbor's ghostly image is really great designs in game, The Uruks also are nice since even though some are reused models, they are still distinguishable due to different armor designs. The thing i really liked though is how their image change if you have hurt of burned them too. A score of 9/10.Sound and music - I liked the voice acting of the characters and the enemies in game, it is smooth, spot on and really gives life to the character they try to portray. As to the music however, i never really remembered anything nor did i hear anything good. A score of 7/10Overall = 8.00This is one of the underdog games of 2014 that surprised everyone and is the runner up for the most GOTYs of that year and it is really deserving of the credit and rewards it has recieved. This game showed that it is not bad to get ideas from other games so long as you can execute it smoothly and for being creative in making such a good gameplay mehanic with its nemesis system and also the advanced ai the enemies have. The Boss battles needs a lot of improvement and i hope they would do that in the sequel. It is awesome. Thanks!…"

That being said, this game is a whole lot of fun. it has a bit of a learning  curve as we are not used to playing a game as clever as this. rushing in to a battle is a sure fire way to get killed and rank up the enemy. Not to mention that you may also be being hunted. the fear of thinking, its ok, im only taking on a level 5 captain, just to be ambushed by your rank 12 nemesis mid battle is very real. its a great game that manages to make your palms sweat when your about to die, forcing you ask yourself, would i rather flee and be called a coward by the orcs? ( and they do call you a coward ) or do i risk letting another captain level up making him tougher to defeat down the track?This is a must play for those who crave a deep gaming experience, the rabbit hole is deep indeed with this one.

I am not a big fan of Assassin Creed games but I do really enjoy the combat.  I feel like the combat in SoM resembles that of Assassins Creed III.  It has a parry and dodge system and it really works fluidly against multiple and hordes of enemies.  It does have a story but I am only 6 hours into the game and I have found a lot of story through the descriptions of items and memories they contain.  I also have not explored every area yet but from what I am seeing, the landscape and weather change is very nice.Gameplay - The combat has a parry & dodge system with timed button presses you can counter-attack and perform finishers.  As time goes on, you earn more types of finishing moves and special attacks.  It is amazing to be surrounded by a horde of orcs and watch all of the amazing moves you can make and gruesome finishers as you parry and flip over them.  Some of the enemies are stronger than others, especially when you get to the captains or tougher opponents and you must find other means of killing them.There is a nemesis system in place that really makes this game unique.  Each captain you face on the battlefield can and will remember you and the fight you had if they end up fleeing successfully or they are able to kill you.  If you come across them at another time, they will be stronger with better gear and will say something about your previous fight, or what you managed to do to them.Sound - The music is very fitting and at times dark and ominous.  It can really immerse you in the world if you let it.  The sounds of swords clashing and orcs grunting as you are in battle seem very authentic.Graphics - It isn't visually stunning but it still looks impressive.  There are times when the sun sets over the hills and rays of sunlight can be seen through trees and the like.  Little moments like that are nice to look at but I wouldn't purchase this game for the graphics alone.If you are a Lord of the Rings fan, this is a must buy.  If you haven't seen the movies or read the books, I would hold off until it goes on sale or possibly rent it.  I give this a 9 because of the combat and nemesis system that is in place, AND because I am a fan of the series.…"

The sense of equality really brightens up the gameplay, none of your weapons will ever be overpowered, your battle is maintained purely on how you respond to each of your attackers, and the classes differ in each party so you're constantly having to focus on some Orcs first, which gives an amazing edge to the gameplay. 10/10, best game I've played.…"

This review is for you guys, and hopefully you'll read it before buying. I'm not going to bog this down with credentials. Suffice, I've played enough for long enough, and know, above most things, objectivity is key.Shadow of Mordor is not a good game. It's not the steaming pile it's made out to be by its harsher critics, no, but it's also not very good. Breaking it down piecemeal:Fighting mechanics are stolen from Assassins Creed and the Batman series, fused into a simplistic three button counter dependent system that sits just slightly below AC's variety. Fighting bottlenecks in proportion to the number of enemies, meaning the more there are, the fewer options you have and the more you must comply with the game's ideal scripted fight scenario. It's all massively flashy, but also massively repetitive. Environmental attacks are possible, but often feel very scripted, thought there are quite a few varieties. The game is heavily inclined to sneaking, which it does passably, but not well, and being spotted is a common occurrence.Weapon selection is limited to three, all of which you gain from the start. Runes can be used to improve them and give attributes, which is a good mechanic that was unfortunately shallow. Damage upgrades are earned in tailored 'proving' quests. Application of these weapons is dictated by skill tree progression. There is a sense of achievement in the skill tree, making you feel like you're gaining strength with each notch, but there is no real versatility. It is obvious what you need, and what you'll upgrade early (ranged attacks are useless, early finishers are essential). If you fail to recognize this, later engagements become terribly long suffered and some downright impossible.Overland travel is limited, stunted and slow. An early game upgrade allows short dashes to be activated by leapfrogging rocks to get you where you need to be (yes, you read that right). Talion climbs well enough, but you'll begin to notice very clear passages and footholds to starkly defined second and third floors, which lifts the veil on what you considered to be a clever entry point.Enemies are varied, and kill animations are numerous. But SOM also sadly illustrates a very good idea gone wrong in a very thoughtless way: Immunities. Some Orc captains are immune to numerous damage types. You can't sneak stab, can't use arrows for headshots, etc. The problem is, instead of improving the actual fighting mechanics or skill of these tougher orcs, the game simply adds immunities. This is a broken mechanic, and once more forces a bottleneck. In addition, when an opponent can only be killed by aerial takedown, but the nearest chest high wall is four miles away, I can't exactly invite him with a phonecall. Resistances, not immunites, would've been the step back that completely fixed this issue.The story is shamefully weak for a Tolkien inspired game. Character roster is limited to about a dozen (including NPCs, excluding the procedurally generated orcs), and though these few are well realized (never let it be said the game lacks polish on character models) their backdrops, being the environments you find yourself in, are bland and feel very samey. It is understandable that the world has been ravaged, but that's not much of an excuse for the barren nature of it. You get the feeling that you're one of the last men on earth, and not in a good heroic ascension kind of way. As a character, Talion is strong and virtuous, but also very flat. There's no progression to his grief. And grief this man has (should have) much of.Lastly, the nemesis system is essentially pokemon without visual battles, gyms or a final boss. Before you're sold on the hype and bootlicking, know that there are no benefits to 'finishing' it. It's a collect-a-thon with no payout. And with Talion's abysmal walking speed, intervening when necessary to advance your chosen orc becomes a case of racing to keep in-game appointments you're essentially setting for yourself.I didn't enjoy SOM. It could've been much more and I think a lot of the love for it stems from the want for the old days of the intense LoTR games. But it isn't those games, and for an open world, it's surprisingly devoid of content. Everything is essential to your quest in becoming the greatest orc murderer there ever was, save for one or two Gollum missions added to break up the monotony. This is a shame, because it makes the world feel very dead.I can only conclude that many reviewers here seem to have been raised on less than excellent value, game wise, to give such shining reviews. Don't get me wrong, it's okay for it to not be good, to enjoy a game for inherent elements that appeal to you. But objectivity is vital to improvement. And improvement, in the case of SOM, is a necessity if games that follow it are to rise above this…"

Almost every enemy is Orc, again and again and again. I guess they can excuse the masses of dumb AI Orcs because masses of Orcs are dumb- so that was by design right? Right... And as with the gameplay so the same with the environment, it's a small open world and it all looks the same. When I think of LOTR, I think of grand beautiful variations of environments, races, and adventures. I mean I've only seen one hobbit and one elf; no wizards, dwarves, or trolls. This is just one small shadow of mordor. Still... The game is good. The challenges themselves are challenging and fun. The action is exciting. The graphical detail of Talion and each Orc is all very well done. It is similar to Arkham and AC as so may have said, which is not a bad thing. I'd also say that it's similar to Infamous as well in the layout of the map, quest & ability progression, and use of cutscenes. Music and voice acting are very good.

I opted to play the tutorial again, which solved all of my problems.I am, however, a LotR enthusiast, well that's a little too far. I should say that I very much enjoyed the books, movies and games.  I found Shadows of Mordor (heretofore to be called SoM) a great deal.  I found that the stealth options were fun, the ranged options were fun, and the swingin'-my-ranger-sword-in-yo-face options were fun too.  There truly is something for each style of player, whether it be in your face, from the shadows, or a safe distance away.  Sure, the game will force you out of your comfort zone, but any great game will, in my opinion.The game is also open world, so expect that you will find it easy to meander and fart around, but it is also easy to just follow the story lines.  I enjoy that very much, because I like to roam and get far from the storyline, but I like to be able to get back to it when I want, and SoM allows you to do that.It combines innovate moves and ideas into the combat system, and rewards players for not always taking the easy way out.  The leveling system isn't too fast paced, and although I haven't beaten the game, I feel like the abilities at the end will be well worth the work, time, and effort.The game isn't without faults, I can see how some people would get bored by killing throngs of Orcs.  I am not one of those people, though.  I hunt them down like the bastards they are.I feel that the Nemesis system bears some mentioning as well, because I think this is something that I have yet to see in another game, which makes it truly original, and originality should be rewarded! (I mean, sure it may be out there in other games, but I have yet to see anything similar to the Nemesis system as of yet.)  By using the Nemesis system, WB and IE have introduced strategy into a sandbox hack-n-slash game.There is something to be said about replay-ability.  You can play this game through time and time again, and while the scenarios themselves will be the same, the way you handle them, and what you do will shape the outcome.

While it actually has a story as compared to Destiny, and it's deeper, it's still seriously lacking considering how much material Tolkien provided in the original sources.  I get it, I'm revenging my family's death, but I just haven't don't feel compelled to disrupt the chain of command.  I have little reference for the locations.  So far, all the artifacts have told me more about the people then the history of the region, the factions, and the major players.  This might seem trite to complain about, but, when you consider how much lore is available, I feel that they should have made an effort.  The other thing that has really bothered me is the actual game play.  I don't mind so much needing to hit a button and just the right moment, but there are times where you have to move the pointer in the circle, and hit a requested button.  It's very similar to Laura Croft's 2013 release, and I hated it in that game also.  Finally, the AI can be frustrating.  I might find a captain, and I might know how best to fight it.  I can methodically take out all his unit, so it's just the two of us.  Or I could be in a battle, and one would show up.  I think, I can handle this, no problem.  I start fighting, and then, next think I know 2 or more captains show up.  I've had this happen both in and out of strongholds.  At first, I'd get killed, but then I quickly learned that sometimes, it's best to run and fight another day.  Other then my annoyances, this is a solid game, that has already given me many hours of enjoyment.  I knocked off a point for not using all the lore available, and another point for the actual game play mechanics.  If you like the Middle Earth setting, like button mashing, like a mix of outright fighting and a good amount of stealth, then by all means get this game.…"
7,"The journey to Mordor is a solid game, one built on the foundation of games like Assassin's Creed and Batman.

That isn't a bad thing, even though WB games might get into some hot water from it legally. If you enjoy the AC series or theThe journey to Mordor is a solid game, one built on the foundation of games like Assassin's Creed and Batman. That's not a figurative comment either, it literally steals pieces of those games like the climbing from AC and the combat directly lifted from Batman. That isn't a bad thing, even though WB games might get into some hot water from it legally. If you enjoy the AC series or the Batman Arkham games then Mordor will be right up your alley whether you're into the LOTR franchise or not.That's where I found myself, I like Orcs, Dwarves and Rings as much as the next guy, but fantasy has never been my favorite genre. I'd rather have light sabers and laser beams like Mass Effect or Fallout 3.Mordor does what it does well, a great quote ""If you steal from one person you're a thief, if you steal from many you're a genius."" Bruce Lee subscribed to this philosophy and apparently so does WB Montreal. It not only borrows all these facets of Batman and AC, but it IMPROVES on them.The stealth component gives you more combat options than the big Bat. There's very deft range methods that keeps expanding the gameplay for the duration. There's a huge upgradeable skill tree that will take the longest playthrough ever, or if you beat Mordor in the typical time (about 20 hours) you'll barely be able to open up some of the most impressive skills.That's all without talking about the nemesis system, which takes every underling and mini-boss from the game and turns them into a living breathing chess piece. Any grunt orc that kills you will begin moving up the Orc ladder. If any Captain or Warchief kills you his notoriety will increase, and so will his power, making him even tougher during the next encounter. Eventually you get the power to brand Orcs with your mark, eventually stock piling nearby gruns to help you take down the Chieftains. After that you quickly get the ability to brand even the warchiefs themselves and therein lies the best strategic idea behind Mordor: Do you brand the Warchief directly, or install fraudulent bodyguards that can help you remove him from his pedestal? Nearly always I found it easier to bring in my Orc trator bodyguards and do the job with me. Then ultimately the most powerful bodyguard takes the recently felled warchiefs place on the hierarchy map.So it sounds all good right? Beautiful combat backed by two great franchises WB worked on, a good solid graphics engine, new upgrades to the formula and a huge skill tree to fill out.... and you know it's coming, there's a ""but"" in here.Mordor stumbles slightly for a number of reasons, and some of it hinges on the gameplay and Nemesis ideas. There's always been flaws in ACs gameplay and while not massive some of that is still there. I will say that Tailion can grab a ladder or a ledge almost better than anyone in AC, I never felt like he did the wrong thing at the wrong time because of the game. If I blew a counter or jumped off the wrong ledge it always felt like user error, the way it should be.It seems that WB was making another game, speculation is an open world Batman game. That might very well be true, but since Arkham Knight is on the way out and is open world the rumor is it was scrapped. WB has made a very well crafted game here, and it's plenty enjoyable, it got me to trudge through blood stained Orcs and the sprawling countryside of Mordor for about 30 hours.The story is completely bare bones. Wife dies, get revenge, live with a ghots, kill Sauron, the end. There's a few cutscenes sprinkled in there, but it's pretty negligible even for LOTR fans. This game is all about the combat, and some times that's just not that exciting. The world is pretty bland with just two main areas, and strongholds of Orcs littered about. In fact, if you don't spend some hours swinging your sword killing and doing side quests you won't level up enough to have a powerful ranger. I almost completely ignored the main quests of the game for the first 20 hours and just leveled up. The main campaign is almost non stop fighting and often for no reason.Not to be too harsh, but it almost felt like a LOTR Dynasty Warriors game for the bulk of it.Finally the Nemesis system isn't as polished as it should be. I died at the hands of Orc captains or higher maybe 2 times during my entire playthrough. Mostly that's because I wasn't afraid to run away, combat in war is about survival and my feet would carry me out of danger. I'd hide for a bit and then exploit a major weakness. Other times I was near death and ran straight to the nearest underling for a quick death. It meant the bottom man on the totem poll got ranked a bit, but I avoided having the super elite Warchief grow in power. You also have a last chance move that saves your neck long enough to get out of most situations.Mordor boils down to a hack and slash game. It's Batman, but 100% combat focussed. Depending on your mood that might not be a bad thing, I spent 30 hours there. Solid 7.…"
8,"I think the 10/10 reviews are way off on this. To say the graphics are next gen is just not true - they're distinctly average - and the camera is a nightmare at times near walls.But, the gameplay is very enjoyable and the nemesis system is very good.

9,"Shadow of Mordor is a better assassin's creed game than any assassin's creed game.I spent a good 4 hours as soon as the game started roaming around stabbing orcs in the back, having a grand ol' time murdering anything that moved and hunting down captains before I even bothered getting into the main missions.The game really opens up and shows you it's true colors in the second halfShadow of Mordor is a better assassin's creed game than any assassin's creed game.I spent a good 4 hours as soon as the game started roaming around stabbing orcs in the back, having a grand ol' time murdering anything that moved and hunting down captains before I even bothered getting into the main missions.The game really opens up and shows you it's true colors in the second half with the addition of the ""Brand"" ability which allows you to convert enemies into your followers. Suddenly a 30 on 1 brawl looks less like an impossible disaster and more like an opportunity.The nemesis system is a lot of fun and I had many a ""Hey, I remember that guy!"" moment when a captain I killed came back with a metal eye-patch or a sack over his head screaming ""they call me bag head now!"" and with the brand power you can take control of those captains and ensure their rise in the ranks of Sauron's army, becoming a shadowy figure pulling their strings from behind a curtain as you lure your true foes out into the open and crush them with your army of carefully selected and trained up warchiefs.The only real complaints I have are the fiddly controls near walls, getting stuck on them when you try to walk around them can be a little annoying, and climbing around on archer towers trying to drop into the middle space can also be irritating.The lack of a smarter lock-on in combat means you'll end up combat-branding the same guy twice in a row and not him and his pal right next to him. There is no -hard- lock on either, so you have to contend with the soft lock on system and fiddly wiggle yourself around a bunch until the guy in the pack below you want to pounce on is lit up, this is especially a nuisance when the enemy has a group of bodyguards.The story is about average length for games these days, and it ends on a modern movie style ""sequel coming!"" note.It took about 3 solid days of playing to get ~most~ of the stuff in the game done, sidequests and all, I figure 4-5 days total if one were to try and platinum it AND just play the game.In all I would give this game a solid 8.6 out of 10, but since I can't, it's getting a 9.…"

What stands out is the Nemesis sytem, where you can hunt down and kill, or later on in the game, mind control them, Orcs. It's very fun and it's something I've never played before. That's what took up the bulk of my game time. Doing the side missions where you hunt them down and figure out a way to kill them is easily the best part of the game no questions asked. While the difficulty spikes if you run into an Orc with a special blend of strengths, there's no better thrill than to run into a stronghold and take down 100 guys before you fight a captain.The bad with this game starts with the graphics. While they aren't bad in some spots, in others they are absolutely terrible. The hair effects on the main character are PS2 worthy, and some of the other spots here and there are just absolutely terrible. The story is also terrible. While I commend them for trying to get away from the Lord of the Rings franchise and create a game based on Middle Earth itself, it failed miserably in the story department and decent performances by Troy Baker and the rest of the cast did nothing to save a terrible script. The ""final battle"" was super dull and I feel cheated a bit with how it ended. I haven't felt this cheated by a story since Mass Effect.There are other things that are bad including the camera and clipping stuff in the world but all these things combined don't hurt the experience too much. I feel like this is a good game that just was horribly crippled by the story and graphics. I like that they wanted to set themselves apart but they failed miserably and, that's too bad, cause there is major potential here for a decent franchise going forward.

There were great ups and then there were bland downs.I think the game is really bold in what it sets out to do. More often than not when you write a story within an already established world, you create new characters and tell their tales. I guess Talion and his story is exactly that, but everything else (and there's a plenty of that ""else"") goes hard on pre-established major characters. I can see why someone could be up in arms about the plot developement later in the game, but I don't really mind. The story overall was good, although I will say that some of the Main Missions didn't feel like Main Missions at all, and some of it just happened too quick.The gameplay? It's Assassin's Creed with Batman's combat, which if you asked me, is a significantly improved Assassin's Creed. Of course, aside from the combat being very solid, there are also plenty of other special tricks you can pull off to help you murder orcs. This is all great, but the major issue I had here was that you learn all those combat moves and tricks too slowly. When you've learned the bulk of them, the game is nearing it's end. And some of those are what I'd call core abilities! While opening all abilities slowly and letting the player choose the order is fine, this is something I've seen happen in other games too. I thought I had much more fun with the combat and orc slaughter later in the game than in the beginning. But when it was fun, it was really fun.The side missions and collectibles are alright. Or perhaps mediocre. There's an okay amount of them. What a lot of them do is add flavor to characters met during the main storyline, but those characters were only mentioned relatively briefly in the first place. I didn't really care reading more about them. ""Forging the legend"" of your weapons is a cool way to say ""combat""/""stealth""/""archery"" challenge. It's all fairly repetitive, but such is the nature of the beast.It's an interesting thing that there's no difficulty slider. I think it could use one, but there's two sides to that coin. The game gets harder everytime you die or use fast travel, but if you only die rarely and don't use fast travel, it actually never gets really hard. And I found avoiding death isn't actually hard, since running away from fights is really easy. So really, depending on how you're doing, you might find yourself wanting to turn the difficulty either up or down.All in all, if you liked either AC or Batman, you'll like this. If you'd like to play Orc Army Building Simulator, you're gonna love this. If you're a hardcore LotR fan, you probably think this one ruined LotR forever. If you're a casual fan, not so much.…"

The DLC feels like an option for if you really love this game and want more rather than.. ""hey you wont enjoy this game until you fork over money for the season pass"".  With that I may buy the DLC once I have beaten the game.I can truly get lost playing this game.There are a few bugs in the game like where Celembrimdors spirit will stay frozen in spots you left wraith mode but its not game breaking.There are quick time events however it doesn't take away any immersion what so ever like a lot of quick time events do.Its definitely one of the better games out and I believe if you buy this game which you can find $40-$50 deals at best buy and the internet then you can be assured your money was well spent on an entertaining fun game.The story is interesting but honestly I just love the gameplay.  you have free roam to go wherever and the scenery in the game changes as you progress.  Grinding for upgrades is minimal and the side missions aren't dragged out and boring like assassins creed.If you get this game I would recommend upgrading your elf shot as much as you can and your wraith abilities because you will use it a lot and will be most helpful.The game is very rewarding and yet not too challenging.  you can't go hacking and slashing in a fight expecting to button mash your way through.  it takes some combat strategy much like batman arkham city.  The side missions make it rewarding to complete as you find new runes to play with the customize your ranger/wraith the way you want him to fight.  which is very unique... some runes can be burned to upgrade quicker.All in all i feel like the game catches up with my skill level to where its not too easy to where i can get bored easily.I enjoy having that feeling of revenge if an uruk kills me and I see him get promoted, then i go stalk him and hunt him down or I possess him so i can use him as my puppet to get me a big uruk army.  Sometimes i just let an uruk kill me just to watch the events unfold for him.My only disappointment (SPOILER SCROLL DOWN) is they killed off my favorite character Ratbag the Coward early in the game.  Was feeling attached to the little guy.There are also some moments that get annoying like trying to get talion to hang on one side of the wall then hangs on the opposite side where the uruks are however it still isn't game breaking.I do wish they would've gotten deeper into the hunting.However I will say this.. If you are curious about this game and you love assassins creed and the batman games then this will be for you.  Its one of the better games out there and monolith/WB did a great job releasing a game that feels like you got your money's worth. GREAT JOB.…"
