10,"Best hack and slash action game of all time. Flawless pacing, great graphics, the best combat ever, intense boss fights, great value (huge amount of unlockables and secrets) and varied and enjoyable music. If you are a fan of the original Bayonetta or games such as DMC and Ninja Gaiden, buy this game."
10,"The first game is already amazing, the second one more so.And with this package, you get both for the price of one. It's an awesome deal from an awesome company like Platinum Games."
10,"Excelent, easily in the Top 5 games for Wii U right now, everything about this game is incredible, every moment is action-packed, the game always feel smooth and looking awesome, must have."
10,"Fantastic game with beautiful design.  It's the best game I've played all year!  I bought a Wii-U for this and SmashBros, this game has validated my decision completely.  The only gripe I have is the lack of anti-aliasing which makes the game a bit jaggy at times, in all honesty I'd love an option to drop the frame rate to 30 just to see the game at its best.

If Bayonetta 2 wasn't so good I'd be peeved by this but the gameplay and design overshadow this minor gripe and I can confidently give it 10/10.…"
10,"Perfect. The game is extremely fun to play and must by for any Bayonetta fan, or fan of this kind of games. Graphics are awesome and the game runs 60 FPS, which makes is look good. Voice acting is nice and the soundtrack is what you can expect from Bayonetta game. If you have Wii U, you should pick this game up and check the first one too, maybe before Bayonetta 2, if you haven't played it yet!"
9,"Why is Halo Master Chief collection not on Wii-U? That's what you guys sound like.  I already know this game is going to have a 2.5 user rating because all the reviews will be like ""Not on X1/PS4/PC lol why is not on a real gaming platform.  I bet it will be multiplat in a month- 0/10"" Its a disgrace to the gaming community that people will look up this game's metacritic and see a low userWhy is Halo Master Chief collection not on Wii-U?

Please grow up.  What I've played of the game itself (about 4 hours) is absolutely incredible.  Its the best spectacle fighter/action game I've ever played. The game looks beautiful, runs well, has a great soundtrack and the story is over the top and wonderful.  If you have a Wii-U, please buy this game.  Not only to show support for an amazing developer in Platinum who continually gets shafted when it comes to sales, but also to show Nintendo that third party games as well as mature games will sell on their system.  I love Mario, DK, Kirby, Zelda and the others, but it would be nice to have some more diversity among exclusives.  The first game even comes included free with the second in most countries, for those who have never played it (it is also amazing).…"

Just... great.Spent my entire night playing and every time I played and felt I was better at it, the game challenged me even more.…"
10,"This game is a true successor... a true masterpiece.Level designs are great, great soundtrack, excellent character design as expected again from Platinum Games. If you played the first one, this is a ""not to miss"" follow up."
10,"It is not so perfect in a perfect way!Every wii-u owner need to buy this now, and if you haven't played bayonetta 1 buy the double pack :)10/10 for both games!"
10,"I'm still at what I assume is an early part of the game, but so far this game is flawless. The controls are insanely improved over the first game, there's the same over the top sense of humor, and overall I just haven't found anything wrong with it and have enjoyed every second. If anything changes I'll be sure to change my score, but so far this is a great game."
10,"By far one of the best games of the year. It harkens back to a time when games weren't made to be padded and plodding (lookin' at you Shadows of Mordor, Watch Dogs, Assassin's Creed) but full of interesting mechanics and variety. It's old-school design in a perfect modern package. That's without mentioning that it's the very pinnacle of its genre."
10,"Bayonetta 2 is everything it was hyped up to be. It's the perfect action game and simply the best game on a Nintendo platform in years. It doesn't do anything too differently from the first game, but that's good. Instead the game builds on the first one and takes it up to the next level. More insanity, more camp, more fun; Playing this game will make you feel like you're in an ecstasyBayonetta 2 is everything it was hyped up to be. It's the perfect action game and simply the best game on a Nintendo platform in years. It doesn't do anything too differently from the first game, but that's good. Instead the game builds on the first one and takes it up to the next level. More insanity, more camp, more fun; Playing this game will make you feel like you're in an ecstasy induced coma.The controls are spot on, the combos and flow of battle are still magnificent, and witch time is still the coolest thing out there in action games today. The boss fights are even more grandiose than the first game, with crumbling stages, multiple bosses at the same time, fighting while flying through the skies, etc. The scenery and assets are gorgeous (even if the texture quality sometimes leaves something to be desired due to the weak hardware of the Wii U) The best thing though about Bayonetta 2 over the first one is that Platinum removed all of the frustrating instant failure QTEs that were found in the first game. There are still button prompts during the climax scenes and the like, but none of those ""push this button in .5 seconds or you lose"" QTEs. Great choice Platinum!When I first heard that Bayonetta 2 was being revived by Nintendo I was both overjoyed and disappointed at the same time. The reason being I feared Nintendo was going to lower on the ""aesthetic"" of Bayonetta to make the game more ""kid friendly"". That isn't the case at all here, Bayonetta and her crazy antics are all still here to behold. She remains gaming's best heroine and is a true statement on what an empowering female character in a video game should be. She's pretty much the anti ""femi-nazi"" (modern feminist) and harkens back to what a real feministic character is. She's a strong cool badass, comfortable with her sexuality, and has a humanistic side that keeps her from veering too far off into the unrealistic territory (including a strong mothering instinct as seen at various points in the series).I will say though that the only real issue I have with the game (and this is more of a personal reflection) is that during the climax scenes, you don't hear anything like the cover of ""Fly Me to the Moon"" playing. I really enjoyed that in the first game and it's a shame they opted to just play the regular score instead. Perhaps this changes later in the game (I am about halfway through).Overall Bayonetta 2 is an easy choice for game of the year (and possibly of the decade). It's the sequel die hard fans of the series who will buy Wii U systems just to play this game (as I did) deserve. If you don't already own a Wii U but really want to play this game, please go out and support Nintendo for reviving the series and purchase one (as well as supporting Platinum for making such a great series).  Believe the hype, it's real.…"
10,"I bought this game only due to the lackluster wii U library. But WOW was i surprised, this game is a non stop action thriller that makes you file amazing for everything you do. I've not played god of war and i know there is allot similarity so i will have to check that series out as well. I haven't had this much fun in a video game since warhammer 40k space marine."

10,"Jaw dropping. Picked game up this morning . Amazing in every way . Time to sell my Xbox one. The graphics gameplay and control are perfect . Get this game"
10,"Bayonetta 2 is ultimately the best non-stop action climax that you simply cannot put down your controller for hours.

If you don't have a Wii U, buy the system and this game.  Not only that, it comes with the enhanced original at no additional cost.  For now, Bayonetta 2 is by far the best game ever made from Nintendo and Platinum Games.  Final score:  10 out of 10!…"

No doubt Nintendo nailed to enter into a partnership with Platinum Games to bring back one of the best games of action of all time. The game offers a frenetic action to press buttons like crazy is not the solution, but for novice players can turn out to be a good choice. In addition to offering one of the best graphics of the Wii U, Bayonetta 2 benefits of owning a huge replay factor, with many collectibles, customizations and even to please fans of Nintendo, a collection of clothes of its major series such as Mario, Metroid and Zelda . Couple this with the fact that the game running at 60 fps 1080p. Yes, if you own a Wii U and looking for a great game to do against big names like God of War or Devil May Cry, Bayonetta 2 is this game that not only is a hard match to those mentioned games, as also outperforms in many aspects. Buy it without thinking twice.…"
10,"Just an absolutely fantastic game, takes the awesome action and controls of the first and literally perfects them in every way.  The story is much better than the first, though admittedly still semi-shallow and a bit convoluted without any real deep explanation of certain elements, but doesn't detract from the gameplay at all."
10,"nitido, el juego que venia de la version 1 esta mejor que la version de xbox360, y el juego de bayonetta 2 me parecio bastante bien, ya que mantiene la emocion y los ""cut scene"" me parecen bastante bien, ya que son para darnos un respiro entre partes del juego."
10,"This game is BRILLIANT! Love the story, the character/locations designs are pretty artistic, love the music so much, love the gameplay, I just can't express how good this game is, GOTY!"
10,"Incredibly fun gameplay, interesting storyline, atypical characters... if you're a fan of God of War or Ninja Gaiden, then Bayonetta 2 is definitely worth checking out!"
10,"This game is freakin amazing.  You can tell Nintendo and platinum games really went all out on making it THE killer action game for the wii-u.

10,"Justo cuando creíamos que el año se terminaba, el excepcional estudio desarrollador de videojuegos Platinum Games,con Hideki Kamiya a la cabeza (quien fuera creador de Devil May Cry o Viewtiful Joe entre muchos otros títulos de Capcom),nos sorprende con la genial secuela de la bruja Bayonetta. Sensualidad,humor crudo,demostración de poder y una aventura que nada tiene que envidiar a lasJusto cuando creíamos que el año se terminaba, el excepcional estudio desarrollador de videojuegos Platinum Games,con Hideki Kamiya a la cabeza (quien fuera creador de Devil May Cry o Viewtiful Joe entre muchos otros títulos de Capcom),nos sorprende con la genial secuela de la bruja Bayonetta. Sensualidad,humor crudo,demostración de poder y una aventura que nada tiene que envidiar a las clásicas joyas  Hack N Slash de sus hermanos mayores de antaño.Gráficos:Visualmente es muy apetecible ,los diseños fueron mejorados notablemente desde su primera versión salida en PS3/Xbox 360.Los escenarios son enormes,tal es así que uno mismo hasta puede observar a lo lejos lugares que podrá alcanzar mas avanzado el nivel.A pesar de ser exclusivo de Wii U,no tiene nada que envidiarle a un juego de esta generación,pues gracias a sus 60FPS constantes y 1080p las batallas de un hack`n slash jamas han resultado tan vistosas.En tanto los enemigos sufrirán diferentes transformaciones a medida que les propinemos golpes,de esa manera su cuerpo sera tan solo un puñado de carne mutilada al momento de padecer antes nuestros ataques.Simplemente excelente.10/10Trama:La historia continua,un tiempo después del primer juego.Nos encontraremos con una Bayonetta mas relajada,pero a la misma vez muy consciente de su poder.Deberá enfrentar a un poderoso enemigo que nuevamente tratara de reunir los dos ojos,el de los sabios y el de las brujas.Inicialmente tendremos que rescatar el alma de Jeanne,su compañera,pero al avanzar la aventura iremos develando el pasado de Bayonetta,como así también la causa de la muerte de su madre y la guerra entre los sabios de Lumen y las brujas de Umbra.A cada momento la historia atrapa,pues con cada capitulo estamos cada vez mas cerca de adentrarnos en esta magnifica historia que nos ofrece el juego.10/10Jugabilidad:Como novedad se incluye un modo online la mar de adictivo e incluso necesario puesto que recaudar la cantidad de halos necesarios para comprar ciertos items en la tienda de Rodin se nos dificulta con tan solo la campaña.En el mismo podremos acabar con los enemigos de manera cooperativa para dos jugadores,también podremos seleccionar personajes con su respectivo equipo.La  transformación pantera se encuentra disponible desde el principio,sumado a esto tendremos la posibilidad de juntar magia esquivando enemigos con el tiempo brujo y atacando para así activar el climax de umbra al llenar barra mágica o si uno prefiere ejecutar ataques finales. Entre los coleccionables deberemos recoger las perlas y corazones,ya sea que estén dispersos por el escenario o acabando los desafíos Musphelheim. Derrotar ciertas hordas enemigas nos dará acceso a discos los cuales podremos intercambiarlos en el bar de Rodin por armas,estas mismas van desde una hoz  hasta sables dobles que incrementan la velocidad con cada ataque e incluso un par de lanzallamas.Cabe aclarar que la mayoría de las armas podremos equiparlas tanto en los brazos como piernas.Por ultimo juntar cuervos de la sangre de Umbra desbloquearan sellos para postear en la comunidad miiverse. Por otra parte, las batallas son dinámicas,nada extensas y por sobre todo distintas,jamas parecerán repetitivas.Siempre habrá que innovar en los combos debido a la gran variedad de enemigos que utilizaran técnicas diferentes y si no mejoramos nuestro repertorio de golpes el resultado sera fatal culminando con un rotundo game over.10/10Música:Tal como su antecesor,las mezclas J-pop con jazz estarán a la orden del día,incluso con la canción característica de “Fly me to the moon´´ del primer juego como con la principal de las escenas de lucha de éste: Tomorrow is mine.Ademas de las ya mencionadas canciones de pelea,endulzaran nuestros oídos  magnificas orquestas imponiendo una sensación épica a las cinemáticas. Las batallas con los jefes finales no quedaran afuera,puesto que cada una esta animosamente musicalizada con la mejor OST del juego.Las voces de Bayonetta y compañía,perfectamente dobladas al ingles como así también podremos seleccionar los seiyus originales en japones,demuestra lo vivos y reales que pueden ser los personajes de los videojuegos.10/10Conclusión:Palabras sobran para describir a esta genial obra maestra proveniente de la mente de Hideki kamiya y Platinum games,la cual ha cumplido con todas las expectativas,e incluso las ha superado con creces.Juego obligado para quienes sean orgullosos poseedores de Nintendo Wii U,no solo por este juego sino también porque ademas del mismo se incluye Bayonetta 1 totalmente remasterizado a 60 FPS,1080p e incluso trajes completamente nuevos como los de Link,Peach,Satr Fox entre otros.Recomendado y de lo mejor que nos dejo este 2014.Y para quienes ya estén a la espera de una tercera parte,Platinum games ha confirmado la misma y dará información a lo largo de este 2015.Nota final:10 EXCELENTE…"

10,"Bayonetta 2 is simply fantastic. From beggining to the end it is a ride with non-stop spectacular action. It looks way better than Bayonetta 1 thanks to the artstyle and color palette change. I really can't find any cons for singleplayer. It offers a ton of replay value. Multiplayer is a little dull because of its 6 stage structure but its an allright addition anyway."

10,"Absolute fun. It looks gorgeous and it gets shipped polished  to a shine: I did not notice any bugs or graphical hiccups.At first I raked in silver ratings for the chapters at best, but once you actually learn the combos and learn to read the enemies animations so you know when they strike it becomes easier to get better marks.

It's also nice that you get awarded for not mindless button mashing, even though it looks like just button mashing at first.To the issues about oversexualisation and objectification of women:This game is absolutely over the top with their stereotypisation - they use parodies of clichés. You get the silly, foulmouthed italian mafioso type, you get the black tough guy à la Samuel L. Jackson Tarantino-Style, the slightly narcissistic beau-good guy Luka, the Italian Womanizer stereotype. And you get the sexy vamp ""I care only about me"" nigh-immortal witch, that finds pleasure in teasing everything and everyone. And she doesn't care about men one bit.The sexualisation of Bayonetta, in that regard, fits right in with the parody cast. Do I sometimes cringe when I see crotch-shot upon crotch shot? Definitely. Do I mind it? No. It is a parody of sexualisation and objectification, and fits right in with the rest of the cast and story. I am for gender equality, and I don't like the girlyfication and objectification of women in the media, and most of all, marketing. This, to me, toys with exactly that and makes a joke out of it.Oh, and, something nobody here or in any review mentioned: did anyone notice that Jeanne is very flat chested? She does not feature huge breasts, and that is actually refreshing in a world that screams ""you have to have this big breasts to be womanly"".…"
10,"For me it's the best hack and slash ever, better than DMC, god of war or ninja gaiden, as simple as that. And in my opinion it's the best game of 2014"

10,"I can't say this is the first true classic on the Wii U, or even the second, or third. But what I can say, definitively, is that this is the most memorable true classic on the Wii U.

However if they ever did make DLC it would be a nice addition as it would expand upon an already great and complete game.If you're looking for a different experience to the first Bayonetta you're out of luck because it's essentially the same gameplay as the first just with slight variations and additions, but really, why fix something when it's not broken? Well maybe the insane difficulty is a little bit more friendlier than the first even on Normal but by no means is it not challenging to your reflexes and memory as a gamer.The story and characters are over the top and simply ridiculous, but that's not a bad thing, it's a fricken awesome thing and the amount of times I laughed... I love the more vibrant colours compared to the first game too, the setting just looks a lot better in my opinion and the colours really bring out the world. And along with the new look for Bayonetta as well as all the new enemies everything looks great. Also if you're a prude you're going to hate Bayonetta's dominating sexual personality, but if you like me and don't care and think that she is just badass, then you will love her!Let's hope this gets Game of the Year and shows all the haters and especially game publishers like EA and especially Ubisoft that Nintendo is still in this fight. And that people will buy games if they are **** excellent.…"

10,"Ah Bayonetta 2, what can i say that hasn't been said in every review already.First off it continues the story of Bayonetta, a Umbra Witch who uses her hair (yes i said her hair) as a weapon to fight off angelic foes whenever she comes across them. This game expands on the enemy type to now also include her old demonic friends from inferno who have now become disloyal to her.ThisAh Bayonetta 2, what can i say that hasn't been said in every review already.First off it continues the story of Bayonetta, a Umbra Witch who uses her hair (yes i said her hair) as a weapon to fight off angelic foes whenever she comes across them. This game expands on the enemy type to now also include her old demonic friends from inferno who have now become disloyal to her.This game builds on the first game quite well, even if on a less powerful system then we all wished for. The environments range from the golden skies of Paradiso, to the red and black world of Inferno itself, everything looks amazing. You can really tell the amount of detail and time they took to create each individual environment. The angelic enemies look similar to the first game with the porcelain faces and headless bodies but are still a spectral to look at. The new demonic enemies all look completely unique and fresh. The variety of enemies keeps it fresh, you never seem to be fighting the same 3 enemies for a prolonged period of time before a new enemy and intro popup. The one downfall of this is just the sear amount of intros for the amount of enemies you face someone slow down the pace of combat, when you go from one room seeing a brand new intro then you walk 10 feet and you see another one. Regardless it doesn't affect the game all that much.Next the actual story. This game has had an amazing story as a selling point. Its ridiculous and over the top, but I'm okay with that as is many of the fans. The game itself is over the top, why wouldn't the story be as well? Though the story is not a selling point, it is in no way a bad story, its just goofy.As for character design, they stay true to the original game. Bayonetta loves her blacks as much as Jeane loves her reds. Enzo and Rodin look about the same but that is neither here nor there. I honestly like Bayonetta's short hair this game a bit more then her over sized bun of the first game. Everyone swears a ridiculous amount, and where it doesn't bother me, it may offend some so if that's not something you're okay with this isn't the game for you.The combat is amazing and fluent, the sheer amount of weapons you can unlock in this game is amazing. Once again you can add weapons to both your hands and feet for a endless amount of combinations (no not really endless but you have a lot of choices). This is the only game where you can wear chainsaws for ice skates that also doubles as a weapon. How can you ask for more? Nintendo did a great job adding their own touch of weapons including chomp chomp and mini Arwings. There is so much to unlock in this game that warrants multiple playthous. You can also unlock weapons from the first game in the second game as well for a even higher weapon count, so start collecting those halos!Now that we have talked about everything I find amazing about this game, ill mention the parts that could of been left out. Bayonetta is a sexy hair witch who uses sex as a weapon, and no I'm not talking like Xena from Goldeneye. She uses her hair as both a weapon and her clothes so as she uses her wicket weave, clothes will start to disappear. And at the end of the fight you will climax, summoning a giant demon to finish off your weakened foes which will leave you completely naked (censored by your own hair of course). Now people seem to think there is a problem with this, which is fine everyone has their own tastes and own opinion which they are entitled to, but the developers are not trying to belittle women by over hyper sexualizing her, but she using as a weapon and it empowers her as she does it. Now i feel there are a few shots that do degrade her, it feels like some of the cut scenes were shot by some 16 year old trying to get a peep at his attractive neighbor. These could of been left out of the game and no one would of missed them i think.Overall this is an amazing game, one of the best if not the best in the genre. The combat is both engaging and simple at the same time. You can hit buttons for easy combos and enjoy the game, or master every combo and master the infinite climate and tag climax modes. There are a few oddly placed camera angles, but don't let that take away from the game. I was a bit upset that this was a Wii U exclusive, but all i did was go out and buy a Wii U. I'm hoping that it sells well (yeah i know i have my hopes up) and we can get more out of this amazing series.…"
10,"I just fell in love all over again. Brilliant, probably one of the best action games around. Good graphics, control, difficulty etc .. and still as much a work of art as a video game. It was always going to be hard to top the 'Fly me to the Moon' opening of Bayonetta 1, but the 'Moon River' sequence in Bayonetta 1 comes close enough and keeps the theme."

The game is not super long but isn't super short either. The only complaint I have is the graphics aren't the greatest, especially when looking at the cutscenes. But that really is the only complaint I have."

10,"As i was playing my first run on the hardest available difficulty, i couldn't help but feel conflicted about where this game stood compared to it's predecessor. I hold Bayonetta 1 dear to my heart. This game felt easy in comparison because of Umbran Climax and the fact that you didn't lose magic when you got hit. I was disappointed by this, and how ""mashy"" it felt because the motion is soAs i was playing my first run on the hardest available difficulty, i couldn't help but feel conflicted about where this game stood compared to it's predecessor. I hold Bayonetta 1 dear to my heart. This game felt easy in comparison because of Umbran Climax and the fact that you didn't lose magic when you got hit. I was disappointed by this, and how ""mashy"" it felt because the motion is so fluid. Initial impression of the game sat at an 8.5. HOWEVER after playing for hours in INFINITE CLIMAX lead to an enlightening moment. Everything came together and made perfect sense. The action is so speedy and really tries your reactions and ability to execute the most damage. Enemies so different from one another and having to think ""What weapons should i equip against these guys"". The amount of combos available is improved from the first game since each weapon has specific combos, along with the bread and butter combos so they can be used easily, but also leave room to become masterful with your favorite set. Accessories, Items, all come into play when you have to deal with each fight scenario in this mode. It's the kind of game that starts to reveal it's depth and you start to realize just how far you can go with it. I'm starting to feel as if i'm going to have to play the game for years to come to become satisfied with my skills. The motivation comes from how good it feels to kick ass! The art style, sound, visual effects, enemy reactions, the speed and chaos of everything happening at once! it's a very balletic advance and retreat so finely tuned that it's hard to think of a flaw. Everything that happens can be controlled and you know you messed up if you got hit, it's never the game's fault. The magic builds slowly this time around and when you finally get Umbran Climax in Infinite Climax it feels like a well deserved break where you can pummel your enemies in return and it's oh so satisfying. This thing is Masterfully executed and varied, no cut corners. You can feel the love with so much detail and content packed within. Truly an ode to the old-school gamer with a modern, unrelenting sheen. I'll be playing this game for a couple of years. If you're a hardcore, arcade0style gamer, rest assured that this is an obvious choice. If you're more casual, this game will still feel welcoming, and it might even provoke you to go deep into it's mechanics and become really skilled because it's so inspiring. PERFECT !0…"
10,"It's a great game, you can play it on gamepad or TV, the history is funny except the end, but when you finish the game, you can play the online mode to get halos, end buy new things or play again the history to unblock a lot of items  (depend of the dificult level)"

But Bayonetta 2, its so damn good that you literally have to force yourself to find something bad about it.

But Bayonetta 2, its so damn good that you literally have to force yourself to find something bad about it. If you have a Wii U, or don't, and you have ANY interest in the action genre, GET THIS GAME. Platinum went far and FAR beyond what they even needed to put in this game to make it good and just made it an absolutely unforgettable experience. The gameplay is incredibly solid, expanding on EVERYTHING the first game had to offer. The amount of weapons and characters and items that spice up the gameplay is so vast and incredible. Getting bored of your current combos and setup? That's alright, just switch it up and everything is fresh again. Most weapons just feel very differently rather than reskins of eachother. The combos flow so smoothly and once again Witch Time has proved itself to be one of the best mechanics to ever grace an action game, or video game in general. The amount of trial and error involved with the bosses and enemies creates for a fun and challenging experience, learning the visual cues to enemies attacks is a core feature in this game and is actually really enjoyable considering the enemies are ALWAYS being switched up. Every chapter is filled with so much carnage that I can't specifically pick out any one that I didn't enjoy. It was a ride the whole way through. Even afterwards I cannot stop playing, with all the extra costumes, weapons, bosses, challenges, equipment to unlock and even the new online TAG CLIMAX mode, where you compete for halos and combo scores. There's so much to do that I cannot even fathom myself becoming bored with this title. The story was a HUGE improvement over the first, and was also great, even though the gameplay is the main attraction. The new characters such as Loki were very well developed. No spoilers involved but this game took a really risky plot device (Time Travel) and really actually made it work. Its a split between a sequel and a prequel, as the events do follow after bayonetta 1 but they also do a great job to explain the events that transpired in Bayonetta 1. One very minor annoyance I have is with Tag Climax's matchmaking system being slightly hard to find a partner, but I hope for them to update it in the future. It makes me sad to think that many people are not going to be able to play this game, and I encourage ANYONE to buy this game, or even a Wii U if you don't have one.…"
10,"I can confirm after beating the game this weekend that this is indeed a masterpiece and a true classic. The graphics, action, combos are just wonderful. Such easily accessible yet deep mechanics.

If you're uncertain if you'll like it, at least rent it. If you love DMC, you owe it to yourself to own this game, especially since the original is included for free. The only people I can't recommend this to are people who know that this type of game, stylized hack and slash, isn't for them. This won't change your mind. All cut scenes are skippable and changing the costume to Link will get rid of the minor disrobing in wicked weaves. This is a must own for Wii U owners over the age of 18, but don't give this to your kids unsupervised. The major complaints about the sexuality ignore that it's rated M, so don't give them fodder by being irresponsible.…"

Reviews, on other websites, that complain about sexual overtones are quite overstating this. The first game is more sexually explicit--however, if you have watched any sort of Hollywood movie then you will have not qualms about it. The characters are a lot of fun, the graphics are crisp and bright, combat is smooth, and is generally a lot of fun. My only problem with this game, which is actually a testiment to how enjoyable it is, is the fact that it is a tad short. Regardless, this is a lovely example of an action game and what Nintendo (and developers like Platnium) can do on the WII U. Enjoy.…"

It doesn't do a lot to change upon the prior games formula but it is a rare instance where it is okay.  It is an improvement not a game-changer.  Both games are so much fun that it does not even matter. The story is just as jumbled and ludicrous as the first.  These minor issues onlyBayonneta 2 is always thrill to play.

Los efectos cinematográficos del juego son excleentes, los combos disfrutables y sencillos de hacer (especialmente si se compara con su competidor más cercano en la consola que sería Ninja Gaiden III), algo que es fenomenal es cuando se llega al golpe final y uno desea saber cómo bailará bayonetta previamente a su ataque.El juego también tiene un sentido del humor muy bueno, rememora al juego, de la misma compañía, de Wonderful 101.Gráficamente es maravilloso.Definitivamente es un juego que deben jugar los adultos en Nintendo, pero, con el motivo del alto contenido sexual, pienso que debe ser manejado para audiencias de menor edad,  especialmente aquí en Latinoamérica donde los juegos son vendidos sin ningún problema a cualquier niño, pienso que los padres deben tener un poco de cuidado, pues el contenido sexual del juego puede ser inquietante para un niño.…"

This game has some of the very best gameplay in an action game ever with satisfying and skillful combat that is smart. Also, there is less filler than in the original game! The graphics are wonderful to say the least (At least, for the Wii U). While it does not match up to other current gen systems (like PS4 and XB1), the game looks very nice and has a more diverse color pallet . The soundtrack is also boasting with enjoyable music. The game does slightly slow down, but it is nowhere close unplayable unlike the PS3 version of Bayonetta 1. Plus, it comes with the original with V-Sync and improved graphics which makes the package a true bang for the buck. Also, there is tons of nods to other video games (ie Mario, Star Fox, Metroid, Sonic, etc.). Though, some people may not appreciate the sexual content of the game, but I've personally did not have a problem with it. A true game of the year candidate here if not winner! (Smash Bros, you're up next!) This is how actions games can perfect themselves. Also, no hate for the game due to the platform it is on because Nintendo was the only one with the balls to fund this hectic game. Now, back to the actual review. The game is worth the 60 US dollars (Or whatever your currency prices this masterful game) so pick it up immediately!…"
10,"Stunning game. Ran out a fully charged controller before I decided to take a break. My ps4 and Xbox 1 have never come close to this. The wii u has better games all round. Bayonetta is simply amazing and I don't say that lightly. It does get  more in depth the longer you play it. Simply one of the best fighters ever made apart from maybe bayonetta the original. Buy it."
