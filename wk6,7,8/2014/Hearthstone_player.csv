Once one of these 'elite' cards is put into play at any point in the game it is over, and no amount of skill or luck will save you.  Since card draws are random,  you can't even strategize a way around them."

Because Hearthstone is about as pay 2 win as you can get without placing a button that says. ""Click to win ($4.99)""First the positives. Hearthstone is a functional game that has decent flow to it. It has minimal issues with bugs and runs well on older machines. The game does have a rather kitschy feel to it, as well as a sense of self-parody for the WoW mythos. The gameplay is smooth and the interface is easy to navigate.Hearthstone falls short in several areas, however. For example, players must either buy boosters or earn them at an extremely slow rate, made slower by the fact that in-game currency is only earned through victories. Players are started out with the same set of basic cards and must grind packs or buy them. There are daily quests, but they usually involve winning matches to gain extra gold. While it is possible to win with the basic set of cards, many of the pack cards far stronger and some are actually game breaking. Which makes a player who pays for packs far more likely to get ahead in the game. Discounting daily quests, booster packs can be obtained with gold for WINNING 30 matches. I emphasize that intentionally, as no gold is gained for a loss, essentially punishing the player who is learning or can't afford to buy cards. Exacerbating this problem is that matchmaking is quite poor, and so called ""Casual Matches"" are well populated with ""noob-stompers"" looking for easy gold which slows down the rate which gold and subsequently packs are acquired. Another problem with the game is there is a lack of balance. Priest and Hunter decks have access to cards that swing the game too much, IMO. (Mind Control and Unleash the Hounds being the most infamous.) Other classes also have cards of this type but not nearly as strong or numerous.In addition to this is the Arena mode which can be entered for 150 game gold. (Whereas a pack costs 100 gold.) But can be instead accessed with cash, You are given a choice of three random decks and them create a deck from card options given to you. Everything is RNG based. Then you take your deck and play other players must win as many games as you can (up to 9) before losing 3. The mode rewards you with booster packs, gold and dust depending on how well you did. If you did well you will get more, if you did poorly you will get little and possibly not get a pack. Again this feeds into the demand that players win in order to progress.There is also a way to craft cards using the aforementioned dust. Although it is not at all efficient, cards can be broken down using dust, but creating one of a certain rank requires the equivalent amount of dust from breaking down 8 cards of the same rank. Like everything in this game it is a slow process, crafted to exasperate the player and make the cash shop more appealing.Finally the game deserves criticism for doing little to instruct new players in basic deckbuilding strategies. And has a notably annoying ""response"" system that many players use to taunt their opponents. It can be disabled, but only for the duration of your current game and must be disabled every single time you play a game. There is also no function for players to trade cards which was omitted simply to push the P2W game system.Hearthstone is hardly the worst game out there right now. In fact it could be good, but the P2W model and the frustrations involved with CCG mechanics that are quite faithfully ported over from card games like Magic: the Gathering are front and center without any of the social benefits.  A potentially good, game but ruined by the P2W model. Only the most diehard CCG enthusiasts with money to burn will enjoy this game. For everyone else, it's more frustration than actual fun.…"

Nope.Look forward to sitting on your stagnant deck, and if you're good at playing, you eventually hit the wall of people with better cards. Period. Further, because your available cards are based on the class you're playing as, every class plays the same strategy and there is a definite rock-paper-scissors balancing act going on between classes.The only reason this game isn't getting a lower rating is because the production is just so good.

But you soon realize that weak decks get eliminated quickly, and you are left fighting players who are either using OP builds, or just have a bunch of OP orange cards in their decks (ex: Ragnaros).Introducing PVP is the driver of the pay to win system. Once you see how many people at low ranks have rare and legendary cards in their decks, the feeling of ""unfair"" will make you buy decks.

3,"Critics give it way too much praise.

If you enjoy games of little to no skill in a fun, casual, Warcraft theme, then this is definitely for you.Aside from giving the gameplay an absolute 0, the sound effects, music, graphics, and overall theme, however, are very delightful. For the few months that I played, it was definitely fun, until I realized how luck was everything. Still, outside of the gameplay, it's pleasant, but sadly, games without good gameplay get scores such as these, if not worse. If it ever comes to smartphones (and not just the iPad), I'd vote it a 6 or 7 as a Mobile game, but for a PC game, it doesn't deserve the ridiculous praise people are giving it.…"

0,"Let me get this straight. Blizzard now has a luck based card game. They then add a random number generator to this luck based game. Then they add possibly the worst card collecting system in CCG history in which 5 very likely crap cards cost a total of 2 bucks (so each virtual card costs 40 cents ea.)

THAT'S 10 HOURS FOLKS. You've got daily quests which if you're lucky take off about 6 hours from the grind. Then they give people , legendaries meaning the win rate for a grinder drops down to 30%. Then you got the fact that some classes will hands down destroy your deck. They expect you to plan for everything and your mother in 30 cards.Bout the only thing going for this game are it's aesthetics. OOoooo shiny colors and explosions Ahhhh *watches as 2 flame strikes, 2 arcane explosions, (insert aoe and/or removal spell(s))*In terms of gameplay, there is none. Figuratively. Literally. You draw cards. You play what you can since the number of options in this game is extremely limited. You hope your opponent doesn't have that card. He does. You curse at the computer and a terrible chat system (maybe it was intentional) that doesn't allow any communication between you or your opponent between 6 generic phrases. The end. I understand how card games are supposed to be luck based but the main problem is this game is too luck based and too damn simplified. The main crux being there is absolutely no counter play. None. They picked up counter play and threw it out of a 10 story window. You got what you can do on your turn and then you watch as your opponent does what he does. If that happens to be the complete destruction of your side of the field from a card he just drew from the top of his deck; well too bad (justification from hearthstone fanatics: should've planned for that). Magic allows you to choose what creature you want defending. Yu Gi Oh has trap cards. Even the damn Blizzard World of Warcraft card game had counter play. What's that you say? Secrets? You mean the ""trap"" cards only 3/9 of the classes have and that there are only 3 of? You can literally google ""Mage Traps Hearthstone"" and it'll show you the whopping list of 5 possible traps (2 of which are crap that a mage should never have) allowing you to easily sidestep these token cards.Which leads me to the next point. Hearthstone has 465 playable cards; about 30 of them are legendaries basically making them unaccesible for anyone but the lucky or the pay-to-win. Furthermore of these cards about 80 are useful. Why? It's the meta. All of the rest are useless. They're situational, inefficient, or just downright bad. One of the fun things typical card games do is allow you to experiment; in Hearthstone if you experiment you lose. That simple. Of course unless you go against someone else who doesn't get the meta.But back to the legendary issue. They are the meta breakers simply because they're rare. Rare and downright unbalanced; Now I do have to give Blizzard props, they tried to balance this. Unfortunately the way they tried to balance it is figuratively mentally retarded. They added removal cards. As in if you don't like a card you pick it out and say gtfo. Now I'm all for arbitrary death but seriously...in an already luck base card game. Now as if getting lucky wasn't enough you can get really lucky or more likely unlikely as in that card you finally managed to get out and buffed for the win now gets destroyed cause the other guy top decks a ""kill-anything-you-feel-like-card"". Well done except that took literally no skill. It also means that the luck based level of the game has now dropped down to the point that a 2 year old with the same cards as a professional player can now beat that player. Good job blizzard. All in all excellent work on the balance and luck issues. I do have to give it a one thought because the graphics are nice and the game is mind-numbingly simplistic. Also at least it wasn't Diablo 3 Blizzard. At least it wasn't.Things to make it bearable: In ranked, before a match begins allow people to see what class they're up against and allow them to build a deck. Use a removal card to remove the removal cards from this game completely permanently. Nerf the legends. This isn't league. Set the cards so a random number generator doesn't determine whether you live or die.p.s. It's quite sad when the signature game mode (which you have to pay to play) is Arena Mode. When literally your entire deck is composed of RANDOM cards.…"

Absurd.- After a while it becomes obvious that the game lacks depth.- It's 2014 and there's no chat.

F2P players are just cannon fodder for the players that pay for the cards.I don't have any of those.

Which cost gold. Which you get from daily quests...Sorry. QuestONE FOR EACH DAY...Only 40~60 GOLD a DAY.

It will be a great game for those people. Especially arena runs. You will buy cards, construct decks that are most popular in the top circles. Test them out on ranked.

The very basic mechanics are covered in a 5 game tutorial that gives a quick ""This does that"" explanation via game play. There are fun animations for summoning and attacks and for other actions on the board that can really be entertaining as well. and there are several kinds of decks you can build and a decent practice mode.Unfortunately any entertainment value is destroyed by several factors. All deck types have their own unique Hero ability and set of basic cards, while no one class has any clear advantage on the other 8, each class has gimmicky cards that can make any strategy for attack or defense suddenly impossible to beat or impossible to lose against.  While there is no perfect deck type which is a plus, any strategy into building a deck only usually makes a deck good against one or two other types of deck and easily defeated by many othersNew players do get a decent set of basic cards but the card draw system is a complete mess. You gain additional mana crystals each turn that let you summon more powerful creatures and spells but the deck draw system is far to fond of pulling cards you can't use long before you could actually use them, regardless of how many cards have that cost in your deck. Out of the 30 maximum cards in a deck i tested 30 games with 24 cards with a mana cost of 4 or less and 3 cards of 5 mana and 3 above that, of the 30 games played I got the 5+ cards either with the Initial draw, after the mulligan option of discarding some or all of a starting hand for different cards, (which is a nice feature even if it doesn't seem to help alot) or within the first 4 turns. One of those three options occurred during every one of those 30 tests. Often I would get the same cards i discarded with the mulligan back into the starting hand again.I would not call this pay to win, pay to catch up with players in the Beta for amount of cards? Yes. It is possible to buy more cards either directly for cash or with gold earned in game.  You can also get cards by doing well in the arena mode, which is where you build a deck out of random sets of 3 cards untill you have 30. the better you do in arena the better your reward, be it gold, cards or dust. Dust is a crafting material that you gain for disenchanting spare cards from your latter deck as you can only have 2 of each kind of a card in ladder deck. Dust is used to make any card you want, with some cards costing more than others. While this is a good feature to let players pick certain cards, you gain miniscule amounts of dust for disenchanting most cards. Gold earned in game is also earned at low rates, 10 for the first 3 wins of the day and 40 for completeing a mission. It costs 100 gold for 1 pack at the card shop and 150 gold to try your hand at arena mode without paying the $2.00 real money entry fee. So largely its 2 days of playing for a deck of cards or 3 days for an arena attempt. Its also about 2 dollars for a pack of cards as well, with various bundles for more packs for more money available.I cannot recommend spending any money on this game, as they are obviously hoping that you will either spend more money buying packs and attempting the arena  enough times that they will make more money off you than they would for a retail game like Diablo or Starcraft. All in all, the gimmicky nature of the decks and the poor randomization for drawing cards from your deck make Hearthstone the fastest way to have a bad time short of a sudden injury.

All of the cards are recognizable from the WoW source material that they are drawn from. The UI is convenient. It doesn't do any stupid crap like having cards sidewaysor upside down like certain other games(No idea why they do that, quite stupid for a video game where 2 players are not sharing the same monitor). It even allows you to disenchant unwanted cards to build up a dust supply to eventually craft what you do want, something other games don't have. This is a real game seller. Those other crappy card games just expect you to lottery until you get what you want, to hell with copies or cards you don't want piling up.But on the other hand, you have a game that is being treated very poorly by its developer's. Not only is the balance in the game non existent because it focuses on a meta instead(Blizzard openly admits this)... but It's now over run with bots that they still refuse to do anything about. Bots are farming this game day and night now, so don't be surprised when you fight the same exact bot decks again and again. The bots have even infested the forum now, creating a slew of garbage spam threads every single night that persist until they're pushed off the next morning by real posters. Blizzard couldn't care less about these issues. They don't even use their own forum most of the time, opting instead to go to social networking sites such as Twitter or Facebook. That means that instead of caring about the users they have, they care only about drawing more in, which is the overall feel of the game. It's one big cash grab of a product, probably made solely to draw in revenue which they're now no doubt using on Heroes of the Storm instead of using it to improve Hearthstone.The competitive play for the game is in shambles because of it's non existent balance. Every player with a class runs the same exact build because, when you run a meta, that's how it works. They all run what is best, to hell with anything else. If you come into this expecting a balanced game... you're going to be gravely disappointed. Half of the cards in this game are garbage no one uses or has any reason to use, while a small fraction are best and auto slotted into every deck. Many players like myself(1k+ posts) have spent all year trying to talk Blizzard into fixing this game, including all problems I've pointed out here, and we've only gotten deaf ears turned to us. As usual with Blizzard games, the months roll by and little to no problems are actually addressed. They take the game down for entire days to apply no patches, or patch with 1 or 2 lines in the patch log that didn't fix anything people were trying to get them to look at for months on end.The biggest thing they did for the game this year was add Naxx, which basically just hands out a slew of cards very cheaply to anyone that wants them. Naxx is an all around bust in my opinion. It's too cheap to enter, too easy to beat, then has no reason to even replay it once you got all the cards. The only difficulty even in this ""adventure"" is Heroic Mode, which makes the bosses impossibly difficult without tailor made decks to beat them. And what's your reward for all the trouble? Nothing. You get nothing for beating every boss on Heroic except a card back no one cares about. It needed a middle ground, instead of having a ""too easy"" mode that hands out all the cards, and a ""too hard"" mode that gives you nothing for your trouble. Bust. Just a bust. Replayability would have helped, but there is none for it. After doing all of Naxx, I finally decided to retire. I've waited long enough for Blizzard to do something with this title, anything other than treating it like a lottery machine.I should point out the embarrassing Kel Thuzad voice acting. What used to be an evil Lich is now a clown cracking jokes for bored children at a birthday party. That sets the overall tone and disappointing nature of the game perfectly.But like all controversial games with nothing but biased fanboy or hater reviews; it's both over rated and under rated. Speaking from an objective point of view, it's not a bad game, it just isn't as great as it easily could have been if Blizzard cared at all about it. I'd like to point out that despite what a lot of ignorant people say, it is not P2W either. You can competitive with cheap decks; it's been proven time and time again. The debate about this has been beaten to death, with threads made nearly every day trying to convince you one way or the other. I've been competitive myself and never put in more than 10$. So I can't really thumbs this up or down; I'm just going to leave it up to you as I retire. In summery Hearthstone is a decent enough card game, but it's easy to be disappointed when you look at all the wasted potential.-Drain (Steam)…"

I mean - we're talking about Blizzard - the company that butchered and ruined WoW and Diablo series just for some extra money, but maybe they changed their ways?It actually it is free, so anyone can test it.The beginnings were quite fine. Couple of battles that teach us basic mechanics, everything looks nice, gameplay is smooth. Then we get access to training battles, we get to unlock new classes (each comes with some class-specific cards), we unlock more basic cards and try to build our own decks.First few hours were really enjoyable. I was having fun, playing against AI, playing some battles vs other players. I've completed some ""tasks"" or ""quests"" and got some extra cards.Then I tried playing training vs expert AI. Turns out it means that AI just uses better cards. I was beaten several times, all those rare/epic cards make a ton of difference. Then I've tried unlocking all the basic cards for all the classes. That was a big mistake.It seems like matchmaker rather than looking at your win/loss ratio checks the level of your characters. Try unlocking all the basic cards (which means leveling all the characters till lvl 10) and suddenly you're fcked. I've done all those leveling against AI then I played 10 games versus other players.First day of playing I went 6-1. Not bad.Second day (after some leveling) I went 0-10. Yes, 10 losses. 9 of those games I've faced opponents who had max ~5 basic cards (out of 30). Better cards give MASSIVE advantage. I've even tried looking for some builds that include just basic cards, but I didn't make any difference. Last fight was quite ok: playing against a guy that only used basic cards - just like me. Close fight, going head to head for 8 rounds. Then he pops 2 legendary cards and I'm done.Long story short: I need better cards if I want to have any chance of winning vs other players.How do you get them?1. Spend $$2. Play the single player campaing - which costs $$ to unlock3. Grind gold (virtual currency) to buy extra packsYou can get gold by: winning vs other players (10 gold per 3 wins).Completing daily quests: 40-60 gold per quest. 2 quests per day.Single pack costs 100 gold. It contains 5 cards, usually 1-2 rare cards in a pack.You can't complete quests playing vs AI.I can either pay money or grind for weeks, months while getting beaten by everyone because matchmaker sucks.F*** this game.…"

The character powers add some depth to the gameplay, but at the end of the day you'll play people using almost the same cards and win or lose on luck. The mechanics are quite restricted too, so I'm not sure that they can make a card base large enough to add the required variation to at least mask this element.Those getting higher into the rankings will also realise that free to play gets you so far. The number of players using high %s of rares, even low in rankings, is very surprising and will limit the fun for the casual player.It's certainly fun for a quick game here or there, and it's a shiny, we'll presented blizzard package, but if you're looking for some depth to your skill base in a card game, look elsewhere, as ultimately this is half built game mechanics with CCG-esc pay for power rankings.…"

The game is redundant when most classes can kill you before you can even drop a card, because the malicious computer provides the user with a lack of cards to drop on their turn, yet mysteriously your opponent will always have the perfect card to play. It is a rock paper scissor approach and it doesn't matter your investment, because this game relies mostly on the luck that  a computer selects something for you to play on your turns. So the game adds more abilities to draw even more cards and copy duplicate cards, but taht doesn't even matter if the cards don't come up due to the luck of the draw. Some class are so imbalanced away from other classes played, that it clearly favors them with cheaper abilities too press those Iwin buttons with..

The game has frequent bugs in the mechanics where players gain stuff they shouldn't have making more and more of stuff they never needed more of and the deck that supposedly only contained a max of 2 or a single legend. It is a game that you need to invest to compete playing. As in you need to psychically spend currency buying stuff and even upon purchasing you are still a victim to its poor design and its lack of fair play.A design that wants to be played as quickly as possible in as few turns as possible, why, because time is money. So it only offers 30 hp that is dead by turn 4 ,as you are only given a selection of unplayable cards prior to that turn you are dead in having nothing significant to counter your opponent even though you have filled you deck appropriately with plenty of cards on the starting turns. The design has an appalling layout, it hasn't put cards into rows to be hot keyed. It doesn't provide the user with their own strategic choice of starting selection. It doesn't allow the user to make as much game currency as they can acquire per day from playing, instead it limits them, because they won't spend. It doesn't provide the tavern tourney all week, because that often makes game currency quicker than other matched modes. It disconnects only from playing this game, in matches that you can instantly relog, but you have lost your game that there was no protection offered. It doesn't group players fairly, it groups them with players well outside their psychical level.. It forces starts for many turns  away from the mathematical odd of a coin flip 50/50 or non start for as many turns as up to 10, and it groups with the same player as many as 4 time sin a row, and the same class for many attempts  frequently again as many as 10 times. It has worse loss streaks then provided win streaks, they are not balanced, up to the point the assumption is you are grouped against robots and the computer has simply worked out a strategy to your deck.This is monkey made game was  typical pyramid scheme. It was designed to exploit the user into spending, it doesn't give a hoot about anything else, because if a million people spend buying some of this game's crap and they have too, in having the same features you are grouped against, it has made millions. It uses crap connection protocols when it runs from same servers hosting much better games that offer far superior multiplayer. It basically took the concept from a world famous epic game and churned out total garbage in attempt to exploit that fan base.Avoid this abysmal game at all costs. It is simply heinous. These games should be stopped, and its reign of corruption ended. It seems the common tactic of the industry today is screw the user into spending more on crap that is redundant. It is all across the console industry today with DC packs, it is all across the internet with these freemiums and there is nothing epic coming out of the industry apart from these exploitively redundant hacks. For the love of this planet anybody else with a hint of reasoning should absolutely avoid. These type of games are simply not worth it, do not be conned otherwise by the lies fed by those people exploiting that concept of you buying more to always get less because there is always more to buy when it is never enough. It is absolutely sickening. It might as well be that Nigerian phonejack credit card details please muhahaha.…"

This has nothing to do with playing the cards you are dealt, since if luck isn't on your side you can end up with 4 cards that need 8 crystals and the opponent will have a zerg rush waiting to kick your ass.It gets a 3 because it is a well crafted game like anything Blizzard make, but as for the gameplay mechanics it gets a big fat 0 since it isn't even a game that you can be good at, you just sit there and hope that *this* time your cards will come out in the right order and you can't actually be a GOOD Hearthstone player, just someone hedging his or her bets that the deck you've built is going to beat the odds so you don't need to be lucky to win it.Which also means if you want to be good at Hearthstone you just need to buy the cards you need to win and play a lot, since there is no actual skill involved to become a good player, just the bare basics of gameplay where you don't make really stupid decisions. Get the basic elements of play down (don't use a group damage spell when the enemy has no minions, don't be stupid.) and you will win, and the reverse of that if you have a **** deck and luck isn't on your side you will fail.I really wouldn't mind any of the luck element if the skill element could make up for bad luck, but it doesn't. You can be a brilliant strategist but you will lose against a lucky retard rolling his face across the keys and summoning a murloc zerg while you hold 2 core hounds you can't use for 3 turns. You might as well just download a higher/lower card game app on a tablet, because that's basically what Hearthstone is, just a random number generator with nice graphics.…"
2,"Hearthstone is an usual card based game with a simple yet ingenuine twist - it's marketing strategy. The cards in Hearthstone are as in any Blizzard game could be of common, rare, epic and legendary quality. Cards could be obtained through buying card packs - for game currency (100 gold ) or real currency. Game currency could be obtained via daily quests - 40/60 gold + 30 wins wouldHearthstone is an usual card based game with a simple yet ingenuine twist - it's marketing strategy. The cards in Hearthstone are as in any Blizzard game could be of common, rare, epic and legendary quality. Cards could be obtained through buying card packs - for game currency (100 gold ) or real currency. Game currency could be obtained via daily quests - 40/60 gold + 30 wins would provide additional 100 gold ( first 1000 gold could be earned through onetime ""achievements"" ). Which means around of 1 pack per day or via fight on arena which provide you with 2 packs per day at least for additional 12 games. Which translates into 2-4 hours of play everyday.  On average one in five packs would be epic card and one in 20 packs would be random legendary card. However, since many cards are belongs to specific class a chance of obtaining specific card is very low so deck's building strategy revolves around random cards or you could transform cards into ""Arcane dust"" at very low conversion rate e.g. one specific common card costs 40 points while result of conversion of common card is only 5 points, one pack in average converted to 40 points, in order to buy specific rare card required 100 points, in order to buy specific epic card you would need 400 points e.g. 10 packs while  legendary card is equal to 160 packs.  So in order to built some average deck you would need to spend about 160 hours of game's play during 40 days or pay to Blizzard about 200$.  Now would you be willing to participate in tournament where are fundamental advantage could be bought via real money ?Gameplay itself isn't bad except couple of severe bugs for Mac client which probably already fixed, the expansion Naxxramas isn't bad either, although all 5 wings on Normal mode could be eliminated in a couple of hours , however cards from Naxxramas quite useful so expansion is also part of marketing strategy , in terms of money it's a really good deal since it's provides specific valuable cards for a low price. The game is theme is all about World of Warcraft universe and some cards provides nostalgic value to fan's of ""wrath of the lich king"" expansion. If you are looking for a long term time investment and rewarding competitive gaming you will find this game as a huge disappointment. Surely as any card game results of every match could be quite random so if you are lover of carefully crafted strategies and well deserved rewards you should stay away  from  this game as well.…"

You can't possibly win without spending money or spending 3 years grinding... i think getting some education like bachelor degree or master will be a better idea than grinding this game.4. New updates make the game more pay to win and more luck dependent. Didn't get the right card on time, you lost.5. Clearly a monitored gambling system for basically everything in the game, especially the Arena. Their AI will decide how much money they want to take from you by giving you bad heroes(up, some heroes are trash) and give you bad cards, or ""good"" cards that don't combine with each other.

0,"Complete RNG **** game. No skill required only luck. When you brawl 2 turns in a row and it picks the same enemy out of 6 minions both times and that minion was buffed both turns you can see where i'm coming from. Garbage game, I shouldn't have reinstalled."

It's extremely difficult to be bad at this game, and if hell freezes over and pigs begin to fly and someone is terrible at this game, all they have to do is google a good deck and hope they get lucky with RNG.

It's extremely difficult to be bad at this game, and if hell freezes over and pigs begin to fly and someone is terrible at this game, all they have to do is google a good deck and hope they get lucky with RNG. The RNG in this game is also crap,  and making the game require less skill from the little it already needs. Honestly, you would probably have better luck playing poker than playing this game because it is 80% luck, 10 % knowledge, 5 % skill, and 5 % grinding all day. Other than the **** game mechanics and constant grind or pay to win system, the game is good for 5 mins of fun every here and there before you begin to constantly vomit, so I'll rate it as a 2.…"

0,"Very few cards are playable, which leads to monotonous and repetitive gameplay. Also, for some reason both Blizzard and their audience think that this is a TCG and treat is as such. I like to treat it as a videogame, because that's exactly what it is. They don't print cards, you can't trade cards and you shouldn't spend hundreds of dollars for virtual cards that are designed to be bad on purpose."

Meta is very aggressive at least 80% of meta are aggressive decks. To make things worse yogg saron makes a joke even a longer games. Today blizzard announced some cards change which should make a small improvement (emphasize on small).

Today blizzard announced some cards change which should make a small improvement (emphasize on small). This kind of card adjustment should be done at least a half year ago (players complained about some cards for months). Seems likes they made this changes only because blizzcon is close and they didn't want to make their biggest tournament of this game looks like a total joke. You can try to play for fun from time to time but don't spent any money  on it (you can spend a lot of in this game). You will only be disappointed.…"

0,"Looks nice, feels nice, but it's not nice. Complete pay to win, and if you don't pay it's a grind-fest. Like many other card games, it's based on luck and requires no skill whatsoever. Stay away and play P2W System! #FixHS"

I'm surprised it didn't make its own ghettos with gang wars and Snoop Puppy making a rap song about them.  It had every kid fighting, every teacher banning them, and every christian pastor was losingRandomstone! Randoms of Randomcraft!Remember the first days of the grand Pokemon phenomenon? No, bc you're too young.Roughly 20yrs ago, Pokemon trading cards was like drugs for kids. I'm surprised it didn't make its own ghettos with gang wars and Snoop Puppy making a rap song about them.  It had every kid fighting, every teacher banning them, and every christian pastor was losing their s* over it. They copied Magic cards verbatim and made them cuter.Problem: your viability depended on how much money your parents were willing dump into your endless addiction.You'd buy a pack full of s*y cards hoping 1 or more were decent. It was like legalized gambling. One thing's for sure: it was printing money for Japs faster than our Federal Reserve ever could.HoW didn't learn (correction: didn't care) from past mistakes (correction: good marketing). All the starting cards suck, and viability is fortified by a paywall the size of a skyscraper. There are top-teir cards that give such an advantage, it should say ""click here to win"", Or better, ""click here to win for 5.99"".The presentation - contrarily - is brilliantly done. Shiny, flashy, pretty, soothing sound track, great voices, beautiful art, and Warcraft's charming humor often makes its way in (ie dropping the Raid Leader card and he shouts 'HANDLE IT!'). Critics have compared it to a glorified slot machine, and I couldn't say it better myself.It's laughable that people can take this competitively in any way. A game that has the word ""random"" twice or more isn't competitive. Let's see how HoW plays out:The game begins. You are RANDOMLY selected a few cards from your deck. You can choose which ones stay, or to RANDOMLY switch it out for another. You then draw a RANDOM card. Your opponent draws a RANDOM card. You place a card that RANDOMLY attacks friend/foe. They play a card that RANDOMLY kills everything on the board except for one RANDOMLY chosen card in play. They RANDOMLY draw 2 cards they combine that's ready to end the game in just 2 turns. But did you RANDOMLY get the card to counter it? No? WHAM! 1 more turn....still nope. WHAM gg. OR....you DO get the card, counter him completely and gg; YOU WIN. F* what is happening to video games??? With a pair of die and a little imagination, you can play this game for free w/o electricity!There's also single player, but it's even worse. I played against a boss that 2 shot me in the 3rd turn. I didn't even get a f*ing chance to draw 4 card and he 2 shot me 5x in a row. Who designed this SP?? Dunkey?And these gold-brick critics and their perfect scores. I'm gonna puke.""DID SUM1 SAY MOAR MUNNYZ??//1!""…"

4,"Game is good but its pay 2 win. Thode who have most money can buy best cards and those cards are owerpowered and can only be beaten if you buy cards too. I have lost countless times to some idiots who cant othwerwise play but because they have 3 legendary cards in their desks, witch all are only obtainable by buying expansions, I lose to them. So its good but really unfair."
