### Week 6,7,8

#### Analysis of The Game Award -- GOTY
 
This project is to anaylze games which are nominated for Game of the Year(GOTY) by The Game Award. We would like to see if there exists a suitable cluster analysis method which we use to conclude the shared traits among winners. In this project we would approach the problem with 3 perspectives:

* **Nature & Attributes of the Game**
    + Basic information: Studio, Publisher, Themes, Gamingtime...etc.
* **Professional Critcs' Ratings & Review**
    + Influential media reviews: Polygon, IGN, GameRatings...etc
* **Players' Ratings & Review**
    + Player's feedback on *Metacritics*

**Project Goals:**

* What are the traits for the award-wining games?
* What makes them different from other nominees?

**Analysis Approach:**

* _Cluster Analysis & Unsupervised Learning(PCA)_
* _Text Mining_
* _Data Visualization_

**Analysis Structure:**

1. EDA - Data Overview

2. Cluster Analysis - From Aspect of Games, Critics & Players

3. Cluster Comparison & Conclusion
