"D+PAD Magazine","100","Early quick-time events aside, this twelve hour adventure suffers so few missteps that it’s a genuine delight to play, even as the lead gets trampled into the seasoned pro we’ve come to know. Everyone take a bow… the first lady of gaming has returned."
"Impulsegamer","100","Tomb Raider is a brilliant game on the XBox 360 and the developers have successfully rebooted the franchise for the 21st century with next-generation graphics and gameplay."
"Digital Spy","100","With a well written cast of characters, mightily impressive production techniques, sumptuous visuals, tight platforming and surprisingly enjoyable combat, Tomb Raider is most definitely a release to be treasured."
"The Escapist","100","This is the Tomb Raider you've wanted for years. It needs a few more puzzles, but that's a small gripe when cast against such a marvelous adventure."
"NZGamer","100","Tomb Raider earns its score for daring to go big and then executing on that goal with considerable aplomb in every important area. It looks great, plays well, and is fun from beginning to end. Even more than that, it does all of those things with more skill and finesse than almost any other game before it."
"Console Monster","98","This reboot is gritty and brutal, casting Lara in a new, grittier light and you will see Lara in a different perspective than we originally know her by. Tomb Raider feels similar to the Uncharted series, and has really made a welcome return to consoles."
"Gamer Limit","95","Tomb Raider is the second best Uncharted game behind Uncharted 2. While it gives up a lot of its adventure identity fans have come to know and love, the end result is still a fantastic game that shouldn’t be missed by any action fan. If Crystal Dynamics can inject more adventure elements into a potential sequel, it would be a pretty interesting proposition indeed."
"Post Arcade (National Post)","95","From a story perspective, Lara is now as interesting a character as (though wholly different from) sardonic Nathan Drake. This feels like Uncharted will have to start chasing Tomb Raider."
"3DJuegos","94","Tomb Raider is an extraordinary video-game. Its gameplay is amusing, Lara's animations are stunning, and the game is one hell of a ride."
"LevelUp","93","Tomb Raider is an action-packed adventure game that offers a new origin story for Lara and that mixes an epic plot and an incredibly detailed setting which let us enjoy the very beginning of her journey towards her legendary status."
"InsideGamer.nl","93","The Lara we know from long ago has grown up. Is that a bad thing? No,she is replaced by a new, maybe even better Lara, who will appeal to afuture generation of gamers. If this game is a hint to what the futureof Tomb Raider might be, than we are very much looking forward to thenext game in the series."
"Everyeye.it","93","This new installment of the series is probably the best in years. Tomb Raider reunites classical elements with the new adventure game philosophy, resulting in a true Masterpiece."
"Game Informer","93","The lackluster multiplayer is absolutely no reason to avoid what is otherwise one of the best action adventures I’ve ever played."
"GameFocus","92","Lara’s latest adventure is one of the most fun, immersive, emotional, and thrilling rides the series has ever taken us on."
"GamingXP","92","Lara Croft's comeback is simply stunning. The cinematic gameplay, its atmosphere and the ""LOST resembling"" environments are great, while the multiplayer is a nice-to-have goodie. The game is let down just a little by its German localization and Lara's redundant squad members. Nevertheless, in my opinion it's the best game in 2013 so far."
"IGN","91","Tomb Raider is well-written, sympathetic, exciting, beautiful and just incredibly well-made."
"X-ONE Magazine UK","90","A near flawless example of how to reboot a franchise. Gripping, satisfying and strangely dark, we struggle to see how this origin story could have been told much better. [May 2013, p.77]"
"Games Master UK","90","Lara doesn't disappoint, while Yamatai proves one of the most memorable playgrounds in gaming. [Apr 2013, p.59]"
"Thunderbolt","90","This is a game that starts on a high note and ends on a high note, and propels Lara with a brisk pace in between, without falling into monotony. It’s an exceptional new start for the Tomb Raider franchise."
"Game Over Online","90","Tomb Raider’s whole is greater than the sum of its parts, and everything combines to make this the best reboot game on the market today."
"GameOver.gr","90","A breathtaking reboot of Lara Croft's adventures, the new Tomb Raider puts aside some of its legacy in favor of a more modern feel and gameplay. Old school fans may find this a bit unsettling, but no matter what type of gamer you are, Tomb Rider is one hell of a ride."
"Eurogamer Spain","90","It surely isn't easy to produce a game as fun, balanced and polished as Tomb Raider, but Crystal Dynamics managed to do so."
"Gaming Nexus","90","After nearly two decades, Crystal Dynamics finally gets it right. Tomb Raider is an action-packed thrill ride full of amazing set-pieces, sharp writing, a fun science fiction story and tons of enemies to gun down. Tomb Raider is a game worthy of the Croft name!"
"Hardcore Gamer","90","Tomb Raider is not just a reboot, but a revelation in a series that had long passed its prime."
"Game Revolution","90","Crystal Dynamics and Square Enix had an undeniably heavy burden in modernizing a character born from an immature, male-oriented fantasy, but no matter your gender, if you're a gamer, you should play Tomb Raider. It combines high-levels of interactivity, excellent pacing, and a true bond between the player and the character on screen."
"BigPond GameArena","90","Crystal Dynamics has exceeded my expectations and crafted one of the most intense, rewarding, surprising and bloody origin stories I’ve had the pleasure of playing through. It’s been a long time since I HAD to finish a game."
"Vandal","90","Shootings, platforming, puzzles, exploration and a great visual experience rewrite the story – and history – of Tomb Raider. This is a beautiful adventure that everyone will enjoy, except those expecting a classic Tomb Raider game."
"Gameblog.fr","90","This is the reboot we were waiting for. Beautiful, clever, expertly paced, it's a superb blend of action, exploration and puzzle."
"AusGamers","90","Tomb Raider reaffirms the importance and value of having strong, realistic female protagonists in games, while also successfully transposing much of what people loved about the original titles into an adventure that feels superbly modern. It’s a better Uncharted game than Uncharted 3 was."
"GamesRadar+","90","Its expert sense of pacing, captivating setting, and dark tone create a truly memorable experience that's further enhanced by an immense level of detail. Lara croft, the old Lara Croft, is dead. In place of a dolled-up gunslinger is a do-what-it-takes survivor--and we hope she hasn't had her fill of adventuring just yet."
"Polygon","90","It's easy to point out the many ways that Tomb Raider borrows bits and pieces from other popular games of the last five years, but Crystal Dynamics has blended these disparate strengths into something remarkable. It's cinematic yet open, intense yet laid-back, fresh yet polished."
"Eurogamer Sweden","90","The reinvention of the franchise succeeds in almost every aspect of the game, so much so that it actually tops the Uncharted series among the great adventure games for this console generation. I hope to see you again soon, Lara."
"Meristation","89","Tomb Raider is a wonderful adventure which reaches the heights of Uncharted. Lara Croft returns in an exciting and relatively open game, with all genres very well-realized. Temples, tombs and archeology with intense action, puzzles and jumps. Just what we wanted."
"GamesBeat","88","A number of minor gaffes, an uninspired multiplayer, and a severe drop in tension defuse Tomb Raider somewhat, but nothing stops it from living up to Lara’s legacy."
"Cheat Code Central","88","Delivers an evenly paced, action-packed, evolutionary tale that explains the genesis of one of gaming’s most beloved heroines. Along the way, we are treated to top-shelf visuals, a soundscape that rivals a Hollywood blockbuster, and gameplay that is both thoroughly engaging and aesthetically varied."
"MondoXbox","87","Tomb Raider's reboot is definitely a success delivering a deep, adrenalinic and spectacular game with a new and charismatic Lara Croft. Our main complaint is with the lack of greater scale puzzles and more challenging ones, something the game should have retained from its predecessors."
"Critical Hit","86","This game is Tomb Raider through and through, while not being the Tomb Raider you grew up with. The franchise that defined a genre has stopped being schooled and moved from the back seat to the fore."
"CD-Action","85","The new Tomb Raider is not as revolutionary as the original from 1996 but this reboot is the most mature, interesting and friendly entry to the series. For me it is Uncharted on steroids, a game that’s better in every aspect than Nathan Drake’s adventures. [CD-Action 04/2013, p.52]"
"GameWatcher","85","Flawed as its presentation of the young Lara story may be, Tomb Raider is a great game first and an interesting story second. The latter certainly stumbles frequently throughout, but I was never put-off enough to actually stop playing - chiefly because the gameplay I was indulging in was so persuasively fun. That’s what matters in the end."
"XGN","85","Tomb Raider tells a great story combined with enjoyable gameplay, though the latter slightly diminishes the impact of the former."
"Gamer.nl","85","The new Tomb Raider might be the best one since the original, because it lets go of the classic formula. The reboot gives us a young Lara Croft who ended up in a thriller in a jungle and responds to that like a human made out of flesh and blood. Unfortunately this direction was dropped in the second act, after which they thankfully restore themselves and make good on an adventure that you will not want to end."
"JeuxActu","85","Quotation forthcoming."
"The Globe and Mail (Toronto)","85","Lara Croft emerges from this game a darker, more troubled protagonist. But that’s okay – just like James Bond and Batman, she’s better off for it. Gamers are too, since this is certainly the best Tomb Raider game on this generation of consoles."
"Gameplanet","85","Lara's return is a triumphant one, providing gamers with a visually breathtaking adventure around a well-realised island setting that harbours some dark secrets. Some more challenging puzzles and platforming would have been welcome, but as it stands, Tomb Raider is a thrilling reboot of a legendary franchise."
"SpazioGames","85","Miss Croft's return is a finely crafted action-adventure title, with solid game design choices and some spectacular moments. The action-packed gameplay can't really support the forcefully crude and violent narrative of the campaign though, and the lack of originality and challenge lessens the experience in the end. It's definitely a great game, but with some ballsy moves it could have been an amazing one."
"GameSpot","85","The single-player campaign here is the main attraction, and it is excellent. It doesn't try to rewrite the book on third-person action adventure games. But with its excellent controls, engaging heroine, thrilling combat, and fascinating setting, it doesn't need to."
"GameTrailers","85","A few things about the new Tomb Raider come across as wasted effort. The story of Lara’s transformation is sabotaged by the gameplay, and is frankly a little dorky, with an after-school special style multi-ethnic cast filled by lame sterotypes like angry black woman and scrap-happy Scotsman. Likewise a multiplayer mode, which nobody familiar with Tomb Raider would expect or even think to ask for, is competent but utterly unremarkable."
"Official Xbox Magazine","85","It’s all deftly anchored by a perceptive, nuanced narrative that helps fashion Croft into a convincing heroine who can weather extraordinary circumstances, while remaining convincingly human throughout. These quieter moments make what’s already a stunning ride even more worthwhile."
"Destructoid","85","Tightly produced, competent in both its puzzling and its combat, this is one reboot that manages to be unequivocally superior to its predecessors."
"Pelit (Finland)","83","Tomb Raider is a solid action adventure that offers a thrilling ride, but adds very little new to the genre and sadly falls short of the idea of open-ended survival adventure it was first marketed as. [March 2013]"
"Multiplayer.it","83","Despite the interesting and open level design, Tomb Raider is more akin to the average action adventure than you would think. An overall linear experience, with plenty of cinematic sequences and over the top roller-coaster rides that falls somehow short of expectations when it comes to the survival matter."
"Toronto Sun","80","It’s a fine return to form for the heroine whose comically conical boobs once fuelled a thousand adolescent quests for mythical nude codes. Lara Croft’s a real girl now, with real motivations, fears and feelings. And this is one reboot we hope will stick."
"Joystiq","80","The combat is the best it's ever been, puzzles are short but satisfying, and Yamatai is a veritable platforming playground. For the series fanatic, there are loads of secrets to find and a new legend to digest. More importantly, it just may convince a new generation to like Tomb Raider again."
"games(TM)","80","There’s an awful lot to like about Tomb Raider. It takes the gameplay Uncharted has used to such great effect (which was, of course, nicked from Tomb Raider in the first place), and replaces wise-cracking gentleman-thief Nathan Drake with this new damaged Lara Croft, one of the most involving characters seen in a computer game to date."
"VideoGamer","80","It is extremely impressive, on both technical and artistic levels. With that degree of sheen does come a lack of edge, of course, and Tomb Raider is not a brave game. Nor is it one that’ll likely live long in the memory, but while you’re walking in Lara’s muddy size fours, it is spellbinding."
"Guardian","80","Lara's exquisite animation allows her to move through the world with unmatched grace, and the heavy emphasis on combat is more palatable thanks to its ease of interaction, Lara naturally crouching behind cover and switching between her bow, pistol, rifle and shotgun with rare quickness and ease."
"Giant Bomb","80","Tomb Raider might be guilty of trying to do too many things at once, but the relative quality of each one of those individual things is high enough that the whole is still pretty satisfying."
"Metro GameCentral","80","A great cinematic action adventure, with one of gaming’s great lead performances, although its Tomb Raider DNA seems fragmented and even degenerative in parts."
"Eurogamer Italy","80","Crystal Dynamics built a gorgeous game, with a lot of good ideas and an astonishing artistic direction. Unfortunately, the game script is poor, and the lack of strong characters and design innovations make the latter part of Tomb Raider a spectacular third person shooter, but one without personality."
"Official Xbox Magazine UK","80","An excellent game that, while paying tribute to Lara Croft's heritage, certainly feels like a new beginning - mechanically as well as thematically. It's visually dazzling, narratively affecting, dangerously near best-in-class when it comes to solid shooting, vertiginous platforming and ballsy set plays... and bodes fantastically for any future instalments."
"EGM","80","When taken for what it is—and not what it could have been—we’ve been given a game that serves as a fantastic first step, but which also is clearly only a first step in what will be an arduous journey."
"Edge Magazine","80","Whether she’s huddled up against the cold or sending five men to their doom with an explosive arrow, this is still Lara Croft, one of gaming’s most distinctive heroes – and now she has a personality that extends far beyond the bounds of her bra straps. If the purpose of a reboot is to redefine a character and set them up for the future, then this is a job well done."
"Eurogamer","80","Beneath the noise there is an engaging story clamouring to be heard, and there are moments of true beauty, serenity and pathos fighting for attention. The game does get better as it goes on, and despite the distractions the last few hours are a pleasure to play. At the centre of it all is a brilliant character, still iconic but more human and believable than she's ever been before."
"ActionTrip","77","Our main beef is that the developers have spent an excessive amount of time polishing and perfecting those cinematics and QTEs, instead of developing more engaging puzzles and even the occasional riddle wouldn’t have gone amiss."
"Xbox Achievements","75","There is a platform here for Crystal Dynamics to take Lara’s shenanigans to a new level, but a reliance on fairly bog standard shooter mechanics just doesn’t do the franchise any justice and as a result, means Tomb Raider falls short of being a truly great game."
"Games.cz","70","A good comeback of the most popular gaming heroine ever. Tomb Raider is a pleasing and relaxing thing that is not going to bore you. However, this is not a game you are going to remember in a few months as a something special."
"Gamereactor Sweden","70","While it can be nice to be held by the hand, Crystal Dynamics' grip could have been a lot looser."
"Gaming Age","67","All in all, this Tomb Raider reboot isn’t perfect. But it is a step in the right direction for the series, and again marks the most fun I’ve had with a Tomb Raider title in a while. It’s got enough of that AAA polish to make it a contender, but I feel that the series is going to need some fresh ideas if it really wants to compete with the big hitters."
"GameCritics","65","Tomb Raider is a fine game, but something essential feels like it has been left out. Lara seems to have found the map, but missed the treasure."
"Machinima","60","It’s really hard to be excited about the future of Tomb Raider after this game. It fails where more successful films and games of its kind succeed: in its characters. The way in which Lara goes from inexperienced to full-on action movie hero survivalist is so jarring that it’s near impossible as a player to remain on the same emotional wavelength as the story. Because of this the rest of the game falters."
