"Playstation Official Magazine Australia","100","As a game, The Last of Us will occasionally falter. Imperfect underwater mechanics and careless friendly AI that insists on blocking your path or causing unnecessary firefights can irk, but they are very minor niggles and should be treated as such. Because as an experience, The Last of Us is powerful, emotionally draining and absolutely one of the finest games of this generation. [August 2013, p70]"
"Thunderbolt","100","The Last of Us is a sobering conclusion to Naughty Dog’s relationship with the PlayStation 3. It is the studio’s finest game to date, marrying gameplay and fiction better than any of the Uncharted games. It’s sometimes haunting, sometimes beautiful, but more than anything else it feels real, and both you and Joel are very much vulnerable to it."
"LEVEL (Czech Republic)","100","It's not a big surprise the game is good. Surprising is it's even better than anyone would have thought. A beautiful and atmospheric game with many moments only Alzheimer will hide them from you. [Issue#231]"
"Gamestyle","100","There was no violence for violence sake, everything felt like it was done with perfect context. The writers and those that acted in the game all deserve a lot of credit, it was one of the most amazing experiences I have ever had with a controller in my hands."
"D+PAD Magazine","100","The Last of Us is the type of game that could only be crafted by a developer willing to take risks. Were Naughty Dog to have thrown its money at yearly iterations of Uncharted, it would likely still have found its audience, but with The Last of Us it has struck out in a bold new direction that asks some very big questions about some of the fundamental aspects of videogame culture and the relationship that exists between gamer and game."
"DarkStation","100","The Last of Us is a masterful tale of two individuals who are both authentic and flawed. It creates one of the most memorable video game experiences I have ever played and I believe its the best game to come out in the last ten years."
"Impulsegamer","100","The Last of Us is truly what a game can aspire to. It’s a full interactive experience package."
"Game Over Online","100","It effectively closes out this generation on a high note while simultaneously raising expectations for gaming storylines and their presentation in the next console generation."
"Gaming Age","100","The game hits all the right notes and proves that Naughty Dog really knows how to design interesting, gorgeous and enjoyable games."
"DarkZero","100","At the end of the day, one detail is all that matters about the The Last of Us: its single-player campaign. Naughty Dog has taken what it’s learnt from crafting the Uncharted franchise and spun that experience into a more down-to-earth, realistic adventure that shines with storytelling excellence, great combat, tense atmosphere and the highest quality in presentation, making The Last of Us one of Sony’s best exclusives for the PS3’s ever-growing library of great games."
"GameOver.gr","100","A masterpiece of storytelling and modern game design."
"Eurogamer Germany","100","Cutting your teeth on astonishingly good-looking and immaculately presented fluff pieces and then going ahead to produce arguably the darkest game of this generation – that's the sort of trick only the real heavyweights can pull off. Naughty Dog's game ain't begging for sympathy, it doesn't care if you like it or not. As such, it's a wake-up call for the medium, determined that the line isn't drawn between good and evil or right and wrong, but between you and the others."
"LevelUp","100","Naughty Dog has proven itself again as one of the most accomplished development teams in the world. With The Last of Us they have given us a consistent and interesting world that is supported by practically all of its game mechanics. From the rich complex combat system to the sublime sound design, this game immerses the player in one of the most visceral plots in this generation. Maybe the AI could have been better, but, overall, this game proves how far the craftsmanship of making video games has come."
"Game Revolution","100","In atmosphere and narrative, Naughty Dog knows few barriers, and turning their talent and craftsmanship to such haunting and profound subject matter will ensure that the developer is poised to continue its dominance as a premier auteur development studio well into the next generation of console hardware."
"Games.cz","100","Is it possible for a title of a dying platform to become a game of the year? The Last of Us is a hot candidate not because it has amazing graphics, but because it has a solid storyline for the generic post-apocalyptic genre. The game proves in a remarkable way that even a great thing may be even greater, and that a whole thing may be even more than just a sum of the individual components."
"Eurogamer Sweden","100","With The Last of Us, developer Naughty Dog has not only created a modern classic, but also one of the finest gaming experiences of all time. The fact that they set a new bar for interactive storytelling almost seems like a bonus."
"Joystiq","100","The Last of Us is not a cheerful story, but it's a damned good one."
"Push Square","100","An assured, touching, and engrossing adventure, The Last of Us represents a watershed moment for the medium. The unlikely bond that blossoms between the title’s two lead characters is both heartrending and poignantly paced – but the release delivers much more than captivating cinematics. This is a meaty slice of survival action that masterfully depicts the horrors of life in a post-pandemic setting."
"TheSixthAxis","100","Here the developers have carefully pieced together something rarely seen in the industry – a considerably more substantial, meaty take on the saturated third person adventure genre, and one that surprises at every turn without wrong-footing a player ready to invest serious time and emotion into the project. A real achievement, and one that respects you as an adult."
"Telegraph","100","It would be disingenuous to suggest that The Last of Us is immune from blockbuster video game excess --the total number of kills at the final stats page will still run into the many hundreds-- but it’s one of the few games to try and make some kind of sense of it without compromising its quality of action...In that, and so many other things, The Last of Us is a triumph."
"PlayStation LifeStyle","100","It’s a hallmark of excellence in writing, design, and performance. Naughty Dog and Sony not only have a system seller on their hands, but a game that’ll define an entire console generation—a true classic that’ll be talked about and fondly regarded for years to come."
"Guardian","100","The Last of Us is visually arresting, mechanically solid, maturely written and by turns heart-rending, tense, unnerving and brutal. Check your ammo. Grab your shiv. Just try your best to stay alive."
"Gameblog.fr","100","There's no denying it: The Last of Us hits almost every nail on the head. Its storytelling, its gameplay, its characters, and their journey in this bleak but almost sadly beautiful world that saw the downfall of the human civilization doesn't ever really try to shortcut its way to genuine emotions, opting, on the contrary, for the hard but humanely faithful path. The ambivalence of the human soul, the spot on portrayal of conflicting morals and the tragedy of impossible choices are all beautifully written and played. Plus, the multiplayer is far from being a gimmick; quite the contrary, in fact. It's very much a coherent and enticing experience on its own, with a brilliant meta-game idea, and a unique, multiplayer take on survival."
"Eurogamer Spain","100","The Last of Us is what we expected and more, much more. Naughty Dog delivers the game that made our jaws drop at E3: adult, honest and with an incredible attention to detail."
"SpazioGames","100","A masterpiece, that breaks the self imposed barriers of gaming narrative and ensnares the player with intelligent gameplay and brilliant A.I. Anyone wanting to tackle the same themes will have to be compared to Naughty Dog's work in the future, and it won't be pretty."
"Gamereactor Sweden","100","A masterpiece. Superb graphics, challenging gameplay, great story, believable characters and the eeriest clicking noise you've ever heard in a video game."
"GamesRadar+","100","Its storytelling is peerless, as affecting and multi-layered as it is grounded, underplayed and real. In terms of everything the modern action game has strived to be, The Last of Us is the full-stop at the end of the sentence, leaving no more to be said. Until next-gen. If this is our starting point for that, then the next five to ten years could be truly amazing."
"Cheat Code Central","100","In an industry where big, epic, and huge are the normal, it is refreshing to see the importance of the little things. In fact, I believe this is The Last of Us’ strongest suit. You will play this game and feel the overwhelming storyline, like the characters, and, after you have let it all soak in, some of your favorite moments will be the small things; the things you didn’t have your hand held through."
"Playstation Official Magazine UK","100","When such a talented developer hits these creative, narrative and technical heights, the result is a game that wouldn’t look out of place smuggled into PS4’s launch lineup. The acting is more believable than LA Noire’s hi-tech gurning. There are sneaky set-piece excursions that outdo even Metal Gear Solid 4 at its best. And tying it all together is an utterly mesmerising world instilled with a seamless sense of time and place. This is a work of art in which amazing sights and sounds fuel an emotionally draining, constantly compelling end of days adventure."
"VideoGamer","100","Ultimately, I defy anyone not to be moved when it comes to its conclusion and the huge questions it asks of both the player and the characters themselves – any game that achieves such a goal deserves high-praise. The Last of Us succeeds in the same way as the best movies do, challenging you more than you'll ever expect, demanding that you think and discuss it weeks after it resolves. The fact I had the urge to pick it up again almost instantly is just added acclaim it has more than earned."
"Edge Magazine","100","Naughty Dog has delivered the most riveting, emotionally resonant story-driven epic of this console generation. At times it’s easy to feel like big-budget development has too much on the line to allow stubbornly artful ideas to flourish, but then a game like The Last Of Us emerges through the crumbled blacktop like a climbing vine, green as a burnished emerald."
"Eurogamer","100","The Last of Us is a deeply impressive demonstration of how it can and should be done. It starts out safe but ends brave; it has heart and grit, and it hangs together beautifully. And it's a real video game, too. An elegy for a dying world, The Last of Us is also a beacon of hope for its genre."
"IGN","100","Its unrivaled presentation in particular sets the bar even higher than the Uncharted trilogy already did, and its writing, voice acting and layered gameplay combine to create what is very easily the game to beat for Game of the Year 2013."
"Destructoid","100","It cannot be said enough, however, that Naughty Dog's new best creation is complete, and when I say complete, I mean it to pay the highest of compliments. I do not want more from The Last of Us: I do not need more. As the last line was uttered and the credits ushered in the close, I was done. The Last of Us had achieved everything it needed to achieve in order to provide me with everything I wanted...And it ended perfectly."
"Giant Bomb","100","The Last of Us is not simply Uncharted with zombies, but it couldn't exist without Naughty Dog having made Uncharted first, either. It's a dark adventure, one rarely filled with laughs or joy. There are bitter pills to swallow along the way, and nothing is taken for granted, not even characters. People live, people die. Sometimes it's fair, sometimes it's not. It's still a zombie game, but a sobering one. Take a deep breath."
"Machinima","100","Overall, multiplayer is light on modes and it may not expand on the core story-driven experience, but it’s still a thoughtful addition to a superbly executed package."
"The Digital Fix","100","It cannot be overstated that there is something exceptional at work here as masterful storytelling marries wonderfully with interactive experience, the high expectations that have built for this release are met and exceeded with consummate ease."
"Digital Spy","100","With a hauntingly beautiful game world, stunning visuals, and a wide variety of ways in which players can approach combat, The Last of Us is another exceptional game from the team at Naughty Dog...However, it's the studio's ability to make this past-pandemic world and its contrasting cast of characters feel so believable and credible that really makes The Last of Us stand out from its peers."
"Everyeye.it","100","The Last of Us brings you into a world where people die without grace, and explains to you the beauty of the extinction. It's strong, unique, brutal and, ultimately, unforgettable."
"Post Arcade (National Post)","100","Terror and beauty are potent bedfellows in The Last of Us, a masterwork of interactive entertainment conjured up by the master gamesmiths at Naughty Dog."
"Eurogamer Italy","100","Despite a few issues, The Last of Us represents at the same time the complete maturity of the PlayStation 3 hardware and, above all, the perfect fusion between gameplay and narrative. Naughty Dog has created a masterpiece that will be a milestone in the video games evolution."
"Eurogamer Portugal","100","I do not know if The Last of Us is the best game of this generation, given that it always depends on what you’re looking for in a game, but it's a true example of how to create a credible world with authentic characters in which we end up investing a lot emotionally."
"Critical Hit","98","I was transfixed by the game, truly loved playing it.  It is definitely my game of the year, if not my game of the PS3.  That said, there were some very, VERY minor things that irritated me."
"GameTrailers","98","Something that plays well, makes you think, and keeps you playing to the end is, without a doubt, worth taking in."
"NZGamer","98","The comparisons to Uncharted can’t be ignored and, while it might appear a ‘safe move’ by Naughty Dog on the surface, their new franchise undoubtedly pushes the boundaries in a welcome new direction. They have put their well-polished engine to excellent use and put the emphasis on compelling characters to showcase what this talented studio can really deliver."
"PSX Extreme","98","The writing is great, the acting is superb, the characters are beautifully designed and developed, there’s a riveting sense of authenticity, and the immersion one feels is unmatched."
"Vandal","98","This is the most ambitious project Naughty Dog has made so far. It's not a new genre, but it mixes up some of them to bring something unique. It's got nothing to do with Uncharted apart from the look some images may show, but still is one of the best games on PlayStation 3."
"GamingXP","97","Flawless in its ambition and almost perfect in its execution. A brave and remarkable game quite unlike any other."
"3DJuegos","97","Plenty of action and horror, Naughty Dog's post-apocalyptic tale is an amazing game."
"Meristation","97","The Last of Us is a really different game, mixing traditional adventure, survival, action, stealth and constant exploration. The resources are most important. The best graphics on PlayStation 3 are back in the hands of Naughty Dog, also the atmosphere, and two unrepeatable and unforgettable characters. Overwhelming."
"Multiplayer.it","97","The Last of Us is a step forward for Naughty Dog in terms of narration, story and gameplay, maybe the last big shot for PlayStation 3 and a fine example of a ""cinematic game"" melted into a great gameplay. A must buy for every serious gamer."
"COGconnected","97","It is a deeply emotional story driven game with an addictive element making it difficult to put the controller down. It is game you won’t forget and one that ultimately raises the bar for the genre.  In the end it’s simply a fantastic game, a fantastic experience, and one PS3 owners can purchase with confidence."
"Digital Chumps","96","Three words: go get it."
"Armchair Empire","95","If you have a PlayStation 3 there is no reason why you shouldn't buy this game (unless you are not old enough of course). The story is incredible, the gameplay is fun, and the graphics and sound are amazing. Naughty Dog had a lot to live up to with the release, but they have delivered in spades. I just hope we don't have to wait too long for a sequel. This game is everything you were hoping for, and more. Go get it!"
"Games Master UK","95","Thrilling survival horror with brutal combat, rich characters and stunning environments. [Aug 2013, p.57]"
"GameWatcher","95","Much like the adventures of Drake, if you own a PS3, you need to own this game."
"ZTGD","95","The Last of Us is a testament to game design. Naughty Dog continues to perfect their craft at immersive storytelling, while still delivering one amazing game to play."
"Pelit (Finland)","95","The world is full of one trick AAA games, so any big title that manages to shake up the clear-cut genre barriers should be considered a welcome exception. For all intents and purposes, The Last of Us is a breakthrough title. It's enjoyable as a full-on shooter, a stealth game, an action adventure and a stat-building RPG. It's about as good as it gets for the current console generation. [June 2013]"
"AusGamers","95","As the credits rolled, I found myself missing my time with Joel and Ellie, yet completely comfortable with the thought that Naughty Dog has forged a new IP where there doesn’t need to be The Last of Us 2."
"Gameplanet","95","An absolutely stunning game that only minors and the squeamish should avoid, The Last of Us will rightly be remembered as one of this generation's very best games."
"InsideGamer.nl","95","The Last of Us offers a bitter and horrifying look at humanity after a ‘zombie apocalypse’. It's an emotional journey that’ll touch you, without a doubt. But it doesn’t only have a strong story: the constant tension, great gameplay scenario’s and atmosphere make for a brilliant combination of elements that I can easily recommend to any gamer."
"Gamer.nl","95","With The Last of Us developer Naughty Dog switches from the easy entertainment that is Uncharted, to the more serious stuff. Despite their differences, both games prove to be of unprecedented high levels of quality, from a studio that controls their ability to create games into the smallest detail. Thanks to its unique pace and adult story The Last of Us has become an experience that has no equal."
"GamingTrend","95","The Last of Us spells the magnum opus for Naughty Dog on the PlayStation 3, offering us a unique experience that easily eclipses anything else we’ve seen on the system. This game is easily a contender for adventure game of the year."
"PSX-Sense.nl","95","Hopefully not the last great game of this generation, but definitely one of the best of them. Nobody should miss out on this jaw-dropping masterpiece of epic proportions."
"LaPS4","95","Naughty Dog puts an end to the current generation with a game that explores the human interaction of two characters, Joel and Ellie, that are destined to get along in a shattered world that has been wonderfully represented thanks to its impressive technical aspects. The Last of Us, in spite of its small imperfections, is an adult title that no PS3 player should let go unplayed."
"JeuxActu","95","With The Last of Us, Naughty Dog provides us with a hell of a masterpiece, which will continue to occupy the thoughts of gamers in the coming years, simply because it redefines the standards of survival Horror games. Instead of using and abusing horrific scenes as is the case with the competitors, the game provides a chronic stress that chews on your brains bit by bit punctuated by great epic scenes. The infected people are relentless and unforgiving, though a bit like the Clickers who will rip your head at the slightest sound. The listening system does not impact the challenge and finds itself an invaluable asset when things get really dirty. As one needs to seduce casual gamers, The Last of Us also has its own action scenes, hence the criticism from the purists of this kind of game. But can we really be skeptical when facing the nicest game of this generation of consoles ? No, we cant..."
"EGM","95","It’s easy to initially expect The Last of Us to be a game about killing zombies, surviving in a post-apocalyptic world, and exploring for supplies. Instead, it’s a game about two people, and the bond that forms between them—and that journey is far more exciting than any amount of infected monsters or food scavenging could ever provide."
"Game Informer","95","The Last of Us is a deeply felt, shockingly violent game that questions what we're willing to sacrifice and, more disturbingly, what we're willing to do so save the ones we love. The conclusion offers no easy answers. You won't forget it."
"Playstation Universe","95","A thrilling, cinematic, movie-like action-adventure with the best videogame pairing ever conceived."
"Play UK","94","It will live with us. Here, finally, is a videogame that will live with us. There are inconsistencies here and there, some lulls in its gameplay, but when The Last Of Us is good (winter), it's better than anything else this gen - we do not say that lightly. [Issue#232, p.62]"
"Worth Playing","93","The Last of Us is a must-play title for any PS3 owner who's not squeamish about violence and depressing subject matter. It has flaws, but they don't detract from the overall experience, and at worst, the game could use a little more interaction."
"4Players.de","92","Quotation forthcoming."
"Official PlayStation Magazine Benelux","90","Despite the breakneck pace of the prologue, it takes quite a while for The Last of Us to pick up some speed again. However, once the cold harsh winter arrives, the action (and story) ramps up. So much so, it puts most Hollywood productions to shame. [July 2013, p.76]"
"TotalPlayStation","90","The Last of Us merges very good gameplay with a peerless story and unequaled production values. While it just misses transcendent status you won't find very many games that are more worth the investment of your time."
"Hyper Magazine","90","As someone who was never a great fan of Uncharted or Jak and Daxter, I am genuinely amazed at how much I liked this game. If this isn't art, then I don't know what is. [Aug 2013, p.59]"
"AtomicGamer","90","With a well-thought-out mythos, a mildly original take on the zombie survival game that relies more on superb execution and storytelling than innovative mechanics, acting that's so good we actually see character development happen without even words being spoken, and Naughty Dog's impressive engine and top-notch production values, it all comes together to make for a wonderful reminder that not all big-budget action games need to be measured in headshots-per-minute."
"Gaming Nexus","90","Like the fungus that infected its deformed inhabitants, The Last of Us is not an enjoyable thing to experience. It’s depressing, exhausting and even disturbing. But , contrary to everything I tell myself, it’s something I won’t soon forget."
"Hardcore Gamer","90","It feels like an important evolutionary step in presentation and tone, presenting a believable narrative populated with realistic characters, structured in a way that remains captivating until the last word is spoken. Multiplayer is disposable and combat can feel a bit rudimentary at times complete with balance issues, but being perpetually enveloped in the stunning world Naughty Dog created makes it easy to forget any flaws."
"GRYOnline.pl","90","The Last of Us is an excellent action adventure game with superb graphics and audio and really great characters. The game shows us a quite realistic vision of a cataclysmic future, and at the same time is a very good shooter mixed with high quality stealth game. The Last of Us is a linear adventure, but this is a good kind of ""corridor"" story that offers some freedom and doesn't limit your imagination. What is more, it's one of the most mature games in history."
"XGN","90","In the developer of The Last of Us, Naughty Dog, we find the king of action-adventurers more and more. Its last game brings us storytelling that is as endearing and emotional as it gets. A definite must-play for every gamer worldwide."
"The Escapist","90","The characters in The Last of Us are relatable without being entirely stereotypical, the story is driven by the characters, rather than the reverse, and the adventure sections, while nothing new mechanically, offer a great way to really delve into the world. Given the lack of truly innovative mechanics, and the reliance on well-known types of gameplay, like the all-too-typical ""find a ladder to climb to the next section"" adventuring bits, The Last of Us isn't perfect, but it's awfully close."
"Metro GameCentral","90","A stunning achievement in both storytelling and third person adventure, with unforgettable characters and tense, brilliantly paced action."
"IGN Italia","90","Naughty Dog managed to create a different kind of action game, one with a more dramatic, desperate and authentic tone than Uncharted. Joel and Ellie offer you a journey you won't forget, just bring lots of bullets and keep your head down."
"The Globe and Mail (Toronto)","90","The Last of Us has perhaps the best artificial intelligence I’ve ever seen in a game. The enemies, whether they are mindless zombies or clever human ""hunters,"" behave in amazingly realistic ways, forcing the player to think up equally smart strategies in each encounter."
"games(TM)","90","It’s the relationships that really make The Last Of Us. It’s a technical marvel, a true triple-A with best-in-show production values, but it’s the beautiful combination of performance and story that elevates it clearly above the competition."
"GamesBeat","90","The pacing becomes somewhat sluggish right before you hit the final act, but from there it moves at a 100 miles an hour. I didn’t leave my couch until well after the credits rolled."
"Gamer.no","90","Naughty Dog has created a exciting and emotional adventure, packed with a great cast of characters, impressive voice acting and beautiful visuals. A varied selection of enemies offers a diverse challenge, and you often have to change strategies to get by without using up your resources. The multiplayer is functional and well done, but is eclipsed by the amazing single player adventure."
"Gamereactor Denmark","90","The Last of Us is a stable and very decent action game, wrapped in an absolutely incredible presentation and story. When it comes to the narrative, The Last of Us sets a new golden standard that every game will be compared to for years to comes. It honestly feels as if Naughty Dog has raised the bar of what games as a medium are able to achieve in this area, and makes franchises like Call of Duty and all its wannabes seem decidedly laughable."
"CD-Action","85","The Last of Us delights with its artistic side but can tire you with its gameplay. It tells an interesting story but doesn’t leave much room for the player. It represents a new quality in the industry but openly borrows a lot of themes from literature, movies and other games. The most important thing however is the fact that several days after I finished The Last of Us, it is still in my head, causing strange uneasiness. I guess that’s what the developers were aiming for. [CD-Action 08/2013, p.62]"
"NowGamer","85","A brilliant and evocative story, superb combat mechanics and an interesting multiplayer component, The Last Of Us is one of this generation's best."
"Level7.nu","80","The Last of Us is a great action-adventure game that manages tocapture the feeling of post-apocalypse and survival. The story isalright but way too manipulative and borrows heavily from other,better, material. Still the segmented survival gameplay and theamazing audiovisual production makes the game an experience everybodyshould check out."
"GameCritics","80","I'd say that the kind of story that The Last of Us wants to tell can't be done in a mainstream video game, but I Am Alive and the Metro series manage just fine. Perhaps it's more accurate to say that it can't be done in the kind of game that's expected to sell three million copies."
"GameFront","80","Despite its major victories and steps forward in storytelling, many of those same annoying video game conventions — the demand for action and high body counts, the lack of truly engaging and innovative play mechanics — continue to pull games like The Last of Us down toward the lowest common denominator."
"GameSpot","80","Despite the many small problems in combat, there's an undeniable tension. Vanquishing a horde of attackers is challenging, so you must fight intelligently."
"Toronto Sun","80","Despite the occasional jarring juxtaposition between its story and its gameplay, The Last of Us is a landmark piece of interactive entertainment, proving that even action games can tell mature, thoughtful tales, with characters who don’t feel like an assortment of tropes and clichés."
"Riot Pixels","78","The amazing art direction and style are on double duty in The Last of Us, because the game’s designers did not think its universe through. Yes, monsters are not the focal point of this story, but only three types is too few for a campaign spanning 12 to 15 hours. There are also human bandits, but a few encounters – and you’ve seen them all."
"Polygon","75","Naughty Dog commits to a somber tone that affects every piece of the game for better and worse. It achieves incredible emotional high points about as often as it bumps up against tired scenario design that doesn't fit its world. Survival in the post-apocalypse requires compromise, but The Last of Us has given up something vital."
"Quarter to Three","60","There is no risk of failure in a game like this. There is only the risk of having the play the same section yet again. In a survival game, that’s anathema. A survival game without meaningful death isn’t a survival game. It’s just a game."
