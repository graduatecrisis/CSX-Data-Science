"Quarter to Three","100","The primary accomplishment in Grand Theft Auto V isn’t gameplay. It’s character. Grand Theft Auto V believes so strongly in its characters that everything else — even gameplay — is secondary."
"The Digital Fix","100","Arguably the culmination of Rockstar’s work so far, GTA V incorporates the best of their back catalogue; the car handling from Midnight Club: Los Angeles, the vast fauna-populated scrublands from Red Dead Redemption, and the gunplay and bullet time from Max Payne, folding them in to form an experience unparalleled in variety."
"ZTGD","100","I could do all of those things, but I’d rather just say that GTA V is as close to a perfection of the Grand Theft Auto formula as has been created thus far. If you have any interest at all, it should already be installing on your system."
"Games.cz","100","At first sight just another well-executed GTA game, which is by itself a great excuse for our ultimate rating. When you look at it for a second time, you'll get the incredibly immersive and entertaining world that will not let you free. There are flaws indeed. But you know what? When you love it nothing else matters."
"Game Revolution","100","Rockstar Games have unleashed the Skyrim of third-person action games. It'll have a lasting impact through controversy, through harshly addictive gameplay, and by taking the zeitgeist of 18-36 year-old males hostage and torturing them with nipple clamps."
"LevelUp","100","With Grand Theft Auto V Rockstar has delivered one of the most amazing and awe-inspiring games of this generation. Even if you are not a fan of the series, the incredible level of detail, the three main character switching mechanic, the bank heists and the hilarious story make this game a must."
"EGM","100","Grand Theft Auto V expertly blends the best aspects of the last two major releases in the series, GTA IV and San Andreas, to set a new standard in open-world action. In a year already packed with titles that have pushed aging console hardware to new extremes, GTA V might stand as the crowning technical and design accomplishment."
"X-ONE Magazine UK","100","GTA V is funny, genuinely laugh out loud funny – and not in a ’shoving a ten-inch purple dildo up your arse’ funny – the humour is told through situation, through incredibly clever writing and wonderful sense of place. Really, that says everything you need to know about GTA V. Rockstar has spent five years, and an insane amount of money, building a game that is not only bold enough to step away from expectation, but brave enough to revel in its combined history as well."
"Gameplanet","100","Grand Theft Auto V is the pinnacle of the franchise and of gaming in 2013. A ridiculously ambitious title that wrings absolutely everything out of the aging seventh-gen consoles, it's a spectacular triumph in every conceivable way. Rejoice, for Rockstar North has done it again."
"God is a Geek","100","Make no mistake: this game is beyond heavyweight. In many ways, Grand Theft Auto V is a culmination of the current generation; it’s a summation of everything we’ve seen in the last eight years, a love letter, if you like, to the 360 and the PS3."
"Telegraph","100","Grand Theft Auto V is the pinnacle of open-world video game design and a colossal feat of technical engineering. It takes a template laid down by its predecessors and expands upon it, improving on and streamlining some of its rougher aspects. It doesn’t break out of that template and can be brash, nasty and nihilistic. But for all its more unsavoury aspects, this is a game built with skilled mechanical expertise and creative artistry."
"Guardian","100","The genius of GTA V is in the sheer seductive force of its vision. The visuals are astonishing – just astonishing. Surely pushing this ageing hardware to the limits, we get the dense downtown with its soaring skyscrapers and murky, rubbish-strewn back alleys. But then out into the country, we have rolling grasslands and desert stretches, coyotes roaming, the shadows of eagles swooping overhead...The world drags you in. It begs you to explore – and then it rewards you."
"SpazioGames","100","When analyzed in its purest essence, GTA V not only proves to be an excellent title, but also a game that is able to make a sublime parody of today's society, taking advantage of all the excesses and insanities to which the world is slowly getting used."
"3DJuegos","100","GTA V is not only bigger and funnier than the amazing Niko Bellic’s tragedy, it's also better. With a ton of mission variety, amazing visuals and fantastic gameplay, this is the biggest game ever made."
"Xbox Achievements","100","Memorable missions, barnstorming heists, amusing side objectives and an almost impossibly immersive world to explore, make for the best Grand Theft Auto since Vice City and San Andreas."
"Machinima","100","Getting through the main story in a timely manner was a challenge in itself, but in that time I found that GTA V was possibly the most well-paced open world game I have ever played. I never felt like I didn’t have something to do and as of right now, I’m going right back in to do it all over again. I’ve been with GTA since the beginning way back in ‘97, and it feels like GTA V is the culmination of everything we love about the series: It’s big, it’s pretty, and most importantly it’s just nonstop fun."
"Digital Spy","100","With a great cast, a huge list of missions and activities, some novel new gameplay additions and one of the most stunning environments we've ever explored, Grand Theft Auto 5 is a masterpiece and a hugely impressive technological achievement."
"GamesRadar+","100","The world is massive and detailed, the gameplay is damn near perfect, and though there are some lackluster side missions, the actual story is filled with memorable personalities that feel more fully-realized than even the best of GTA's previous characters."
"games(TM)","100","Sam Houser compared the making of Rockstar’s epic to the troubled production of Francis Ford Coppola’s Apocalypse Now, and in some ways the same result has been met: a product that represents the peak of the blockbuster triple-A form, that realises grand ambition without visible compromise."
"Eurogamer Germany","100","The fifth game in the series combines the delusions of grandeur facilitated by the most detailed open world to date to super-solid shooting and driving mechanics. Previous lengths have been traded in for a consistently captivating narrative which not only holds everything together, but really makes this game seem more than the sum of its parts. The only remaining question is: Where will – or can –the series go from here? I am looking forward to finding out."
"Gamereactor Sweden","100","Rockstar revolutionizes gaming once again, implementing three playable characters whilst further pushing the limits of the criminal life in a virtual playground."
"IGN Italia","100","The quality of GTA V puts to shame 99% of triple A productions. The story is beautiful, the graphics are unbelievable for the old hardware they run on, and most importantly the gameplay is fun and smooth. GTA V is not afraid to show it is a videogame, and has the guts to trade some of its realism for the sake of fun."
"Gamereactor Denmark","100","GTA V feels like a next-gen game without actually being one. If all the other studious could do what Rockstar can, there'd be plenty of life left in the current console generation. But that's the thing, isn't it. No other developer is like Rockstar. And no other series is like Grand Theft Auto."
"Meristation","100","GTA V represents the videogame at its finest. Tense and dramatic when it wants, joyful and surprising when the player wants it. Rockstar has managed to harmonize the different trends in the saga, managing to create an unforgettable experience that will be enjoyed for a long time to come."
"Metro GameCentral","100","A staggering technical achievement that is matched only by the depth and ambition of its gameplay – this is not only the best-looking GTA ever but by far the most fun to play."
"VideoGamer","100","Unless you play it for yourself, it's near impossible to grasp how big GTA 5 is. It's not just the world. It's the gargantuan story, the sheer amount of missions and the variety introduced with them, the activities to take part in, or the secrets waiting to be unveiled. It's a highlight of the generation."
"Hardcore Gamer","100","It features arguably the best story of the series that’s greatly enhanced by the added dynamic of three contrasting protagonists."
"IGN","100","Grand Theft Auto V is not only a preposterously enjoyable video game, but also an intelligent and sharp-tongued satire of contemporary America. It represents a refinement of everything that GTA IV brought to the table five years ago."
"Official Xbox Magazine","100","From skydiving and submarine exploration to bounty-hunting and watching animated shorts, GTA V is absolutely crammed full of things to do, and it looks amazing while you do them."
"Official Xbox Magazine UK","100","Rockstar's Xbox 360 swansong is probably the console's greatest technical achievement, and as such it's unmissable."
"The Globe and Mail (Toronto)","100","Is Grand Theft Auto V the best game of the year? Easily. Is it the best game of this current generation of consoles? Definitely – and it’s quite possibly the best video game yet. I say this after playing it for “only” 20 hours."
"Edge Magazine","100","No one makes worlds like Rockstar, but at last it has produced one without compromise. Everything works. It has mechanics good enough to anchor games of their own, and a story that is not only what GTA has always wanted to tell but also fits the way people have always played it. It’s a remarkable achievement, a peerless marriage of world design, storytelling and mechanics that pushes these ageing consoles to the limit and makes it all look easy."
"Gamer.no","100","Grand Theft Auto V is one of the best sandboxes that video games have to offer. Where massive worlds often are plagued by boring missions and lifeless areas, Rockstar has managed to make an incredibly engaging game that still retains a humongous and lively world."
"Giant Bomb","100","The writing associated with those main characters and their stories is the best part of Grand Theft Auto V."
"MondoXbox","100","There’s no better time than this to use the word masterwork: Rockstar did a colossal job creating a huge, visually stunning world chiseled in its finest details, populated by brilliant characters and with highly spectacular and varied gameplay."
"Games Master UK","99","No game can match its mix of scale, direction and quality - and we don't know when one might. [Dec 2013, p.52]"
"COGconnected","99","The world of Grand Theft Auto V is undeniably a masterpiece and has set a very high bar for sandbox gaming not only for this generation but for the next gen which is so closely upon us. Beyond the game’s story line you’ll be able to put in hundreds of hours just wandering the city streets and never be bored doing so."
"Gaming Nexus","98","Rockstar Games has managed to exceed my expectations and create one of the best games of this generation."
"ActionTrip","98","Grand Theft Auto 5 defines what we want out of a free-roam action game. It also outshines all of its predecessors in every possible way, because it perfects the familiar formula and takes it to new heights."
"GameTrailers","98","For the anarchist, GTA5 is quite a playground. The entire map is available once you get through an hour or so of the story, and the tools of destruction are numerous and hugely enjoyable, although some of them might need to be unlocked first. The Gatling gun returns and a gas canister spills a solid line of flammable justice waiting to be set off. Guns can be painted up and modded with flashlights, grips, scopes, and suppressors."
"AusGamers","98","The standout factor for Grand Theft Auto V is that each character not only offers a unique perspective on the GTA world in which you’re taking part, but on gaming as a whole. Franklin is new to the ‘game’ -- he looks sharp and listens and learns. Michael is as I’ve painted him to be: a reluctant master in an ever-changing dojo clinging to a wall of arbitrary yet important-to-him trophies, while Trevor is the wild side in every gamer (thanks Joab) -- the sort of yes-man we inevitably become because pain and reward exist on a blurred precipice in modern narrative-driven gaming."
"Game Informer","98","The narrative fails to match the impact John Marston or Niko Bellic's tales, but the colorful characters kept me interested in the story nonetheless. Like the golden state it parodies, Grand Theft Auto V is filled with beautiful scenery, a wealth of activities, and the promise of fortune."
"Gamers' Temple","96","GTA V continues the game series' tradition of raising the bar for open world action games."
"Armchair Empire","95","Tons of gameplay hours, plenty of missions and activities with an awesome collection of vehicles of various modes of transportation and a large array of firearms put the grandeur once again into Grand Theft Auto."
"Game Over Online","95","GTA5’s main single player story mode delivers the best Grand Theft Auto experience to date."
"Pelit (Finland)","95","Even a die-hard detractor of the Grand Theft Auto series (yes, that's me) is forced to admit that ""V"" is one sweet game. In fact, it's one of the best of this generation. [Oct 2013]"
"GamingTrend","95","I can’t imagine the pressure behind the scenes, but everything that Rockstar has attempted with Grand Theft Auto V gels together perfectly. As we look forward to the next-generation launches in just a few months, it’s pretty awesome to see the best game of this entire generation cap it off."
"Polygon","95","Rockstar has expanded and improved upon so much of what's special about video games as mainstream spectacles, from the playful use of characters to the refined take on world design. The developer's progress makes the aspects of the game left in cultural stasis — the poorly drawn women, the empty cynicism, the unnecessarily excessive cruelty — especially agitating."
"Riot Pixels","94","The most amazing thing about this criminal saga is not only its scale, but that it perfectly works on several levels. Spine-tingling driving, fun missions, excellent dialogue, fully fleshed characters, vicious satire on pretty much everything… One play-through is not enough to appreciate GTA 5 in all its multi-layered glory."
"Toronto Sun","90","Its problems range from finicky little things like twitchy helicopter flying controls to much larger issues, such as unsettling bits of cruelty that don’t always register as satire, or the still-unsolved challenge of maintaining any sense of plot urgency in a game where players are free to abandon the storyline and spend hours skyjacking blimps, tooling around in a submarine or taking in-game smartphone selfies and posting them online."
"Critical Hit","90","Despite all these accomplishments and additions though, GTA V isn’t a huge leap forward for Rockstar. Instead, it’s an evolution of all their previous work, all combined into one sandbox experience on a massive scale. But it’s a satisfying path that the franchise has taken, kicking other genre games off the throne that it helped build."
"Gamer Limit","90","Although it does suffer from a few problems that have plagued the franchise since the beginning, the improved driving controls, captivating leads, and the sprawling city of Los Santos should win the hearts of any open world fan out there."
"Joystiq","90","An ambitious game, attempting to meld three very different characters together to tell one encompassing story of survival in what amounts to the worst place in America. That story stumbles, but the open-ended gameplay remains a showpiece for the vast amount of content that can be poured into a virtual world."
"Destructoid","90","All three characters, in their respective ways, feel representative of the Grand Theft Auto series as a whole, and contribute to making GTA V what it is -- the ultimate culmination of Rockstar's beloved and despised series."
"Post Arcade (National Post)","85","When you’re dealing with disturbing subjects ranging from life-destroying drug addiction to creepy cult organizations to legitimately psychopathic behaviour, the jokes go down a little easier if you get the sense that the writers penned their quips with an aim to make you think about why you’re laughing...True satire happens in Grand Theft Auto V, just not nearly as often as I’d like."
"Level7.nu","80","Grand Theft Auto V offers one of the best sandbox experiences ever,filled to the brink with stuff to do. The vistas are magnificent andamazing stuff just seems to happen wherever you go. But at the sametime the story is tired and the characters unoriginal. Yourappreciation of Grand Theft Auto V will depend of what you want out ofthe series. The freedom and joy of discovery is hard to beat butthe rest still has some ways left to go."
"GameCritics","80","Even with as many downs as ups, Grand Theft Auto V is still a significant achievement in design. Playing missions from multiple perspectives is a creative spark that will surely light up the next generation, and I'm confident the Housers have even bigger ambitions. They'll keep building upon this template and inch tantalizingly closer to creating their perfect game. GTA5 isn't it, but its flashes of brilliance will endure."
"The Escapist","70","It is the difference between The Godfather Part 1 and Part 2, between Inglorious Basterds and Triumph of the Will, and between Just Cause 2 and JFK Reloaded. In the former examples, the audience can get behind the anti-heroes depicted for whatever reason and condone their admittedly awful actions, but in the latter group, the subject matter or the protagonist's morals are skewed too far from the norm to be comfortably witnessed. That's what it's like to play Grand Theft Auto V. The three men you take control of throughout the game aren't even anti-heroes. They're just scumbags."
