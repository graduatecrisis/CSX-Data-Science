"Cynamite","100","Kratos slices himself amazingly through Gods and their Minions. God of War 3 is the Olympus of action games."
"Eurogamer Portugal","100","God of War III may be a journey with familiar-looking aspects but it is so epic and brutal as you might expect, and even a little more."
"GameDaily","100","One thing is clear: God of War III is phenomenal. It succeeds for a plethora of reasons that go well beyond its beautiful graphics. Unlike the competition, it doesn't take several hours to get going, or burden the player with laborious upgrades."
"ZTGD","100","It will stand out as the perfect end to one of the best action series in a long time. If it truly is the end."
"Gaming Age","100","PS3 owners should be elated to know that his final quest for revenge is a visually spectacular, challenging, rage filled, high quality one."
"GameShark","100","This is how you do an action game. This is how you do a sequel. This is how you finish off a franchise."
"D+PAD Magazine","100","But for now there're very few games that can match God of War 3's cinematic sensibility, its dynamics, its carnage."
"The Escapist","100","On a purely technical level, it's one of the most impressive games the PS3 has to offer: It shifts perspectives effortlessly across a number of highly detailed environments without so much as a hiccup and with almost nonexistent load times to interrupt the experience. But in a broader sense, God of War III serves as an example of how to deliver astonishingly varied gameplay in a cohesive package."
"Playstation Official Magazine Australia","100","This game earns our highest accolade because it is a thoroughly entertaining ride from go to death throe. It finds a perfect balance between taxing platforming, cerebral puzzles, and glorious set-piece battles that loosen the bowel when you realise they're in-game graphics. Top that off with masterful camera work – that makes us totally rethink our hatred of fixed-camera action games – and you have a sequel that easily eclipses anything out there and reclaims it's rightful place at the pinnacle of its genre. [April 2010, p.61]"
"Gamer.no","100","This is the definitive action game. This is a game that stands on the shoulders of giants, and stretches even further."
"Gamereactor Denmark","100","Nothing short of a masterpiece. A thrill-ride of intense action and breathtaking set-pieces guaranteed to put a goofy grin on your face. A must have for any PlayStation 3-owner."
"PlayStation LifeStyle","100","Kratos' legacy of brutality and chaos ends with a remarkable bang. The game is brimming with unforgettable, jaw-dropping moments that will stay with you forever."
"Playstation: The Official Magazine (US)","100","God of War III is beautiful. It's bloody. It's brilliant. But it's not perfect. [Apr 2010, p.44]"
"1UP","100","God of War 3 is the most balanced. It's not quite as focused as GOW1, nor is it as lengthy and moment-packed as GOW2, but it's the most consistent and varied of the three, and when it's at its best the first two can't touch it."
"Gamervision","100","Kratos is given a wonderfully epic farewell that would truly be a shame to miss, and every aspect of the game, from the controls, to the combat, to the presentation, is as close to perfect as perfect can be. Even if you've never played a single game in this series before, God of War III is a game you must play if you have the opportunity. You owe it to yourself, and the team at Santa Monica Studios, to play this game."
"GamesRadar+","100","While not a huge leap forward for the franchise, God of War III refines its already-fun gameplay to near-perfection while delivering the clever puzzles, high production values and pure, rage-fueled brutality fans expect. Add a memorable cast of characters and buckets of gore, and Kratos's last adventure is also his best yet."
"Game Informer","100","Not even in my wildest dreams could I have imagined such a powerful, cinematic, and breathtaking conclusion to the saga of the Ghost of Sparta."
"VideoGamer","100","This is a video game developed at the very highest level and takes what I thought was possible to new heights. God of War 3 is easily the best PS3 game I've played and sits comfortably as one of my favourite games of all time."
"Gaming Nexus","100","Fans of the God of War series will eat this up. It's violent, visceral, and truly an epic game in both presentation and action."
"Destructoid","100","Without question, God of War III sets the new gold standard for action games, clearing and then raising the near-impossible bar that was set by its previous installments. For many years to come, this will be the game by which all others in the genre are compared, and I suspect we won't see anything like it for quite some time."
"Impulsegamer","99","When it comes to the crunch, God of War III delivers on many levels, just as the previous two titles. However with the inclusion of next-generation graphics and gameplay, God of War III transcends its predecessors with a surreal and bloody gaming experience that makes you feel like you are part of some Greek epic."
"Digital Chumps","98","You know, outside of the minor points I made earlier, God of War III  just plays like a dream; a really, really awesome dream. It's hard not to be giddy about how amazing this game, this series, has been."
"PSX Extreme","98","I can't praise this game enough for everything that it does so effortlessly. The adventure will run you about 8-10 hours, and chances are you will go back for another round with your acquired goodies in tow. God of War III is the epitome of what this generation is all about: lavish visuals, marvelous gameplay, storytelling that is unlike any other, and an overall presentation that simply cannot be beat."
"Gamer 2.0","97","A fantastic game that should be played by anybody with a PS3 that has a craving for some brutal combat and plenty of vengeance."
"GameFocus","97","Both an amazing technological achievement and an exuberant gaming experience, God of War III deserves a place in your game collection. If you've been asking yourself what the Playstation 3 is really capable of and thought Uncharted 2 was as good as it gets, wait until you pop this bad boy in your PS3."
"GamingTrend","97","Saving the best for last, God of War III requires NO install and the load times are fairly short, few, and far between.  That's pretty amazing for a game that takes up over 35 Gigs of space on the BluRay disc."
"Multiplayer.it","96","God of War III is a pure extraordinary action game, where the developers have achieved a perfect mix between story, gameplay and visual aspect. Its without a doubt the  best possible ending for this acclaimed trilogy, and a must buy for every PlayStation 3 owner."
"PSFocus","96","The last part in the trilogy is one of the best PlayStation 3 games ever. Kratos is back and he's pissed off at Zeus and the other Gods. In this third part Kratos fights against the biggest enemies ever and that all in brilliant graphics with brilliant audio and a lot (and we mean a lot) of blood and gore. Everybody should buy this game!"
"SpazioGames","96","The intense satisfaction bestowed by the credits rolling after the last struggling sequence testifies the nature of God of War III: a masterpiece, a glorious testament from one of the most iconic characters of our media. Unforgettable gameplay sequences, over the top graphics and an almost flawless gameplay make it a title to have, at all costs."
"TotalPlayStation","95","It's awesome. Did you expect anything different? The story seems a bit all-over-the-place but the more you ruminate on it, the more it actually has an amazing context."
"Worth Playing","95","God of War III was an epic, satisfying end to a legendary series that helped strengthen the concept of the ultimate against-all-odds protagonist."
"GamingXP","95","My former favorite in this genre Dante's Inferno is defeated. The amazing story and the awesome graphics in God of War III make this game to an epic experience."
"Vandal","95","It doesn't revolutionize the formula, but innovates on it enough to become again a game that engages you from the very beginning."
"Meristation","95","Kratos unleashed all his potential in the trilogy conclusion in this bloody odyssey. Refining its mechanics the finest, with a vibrant pace, impressive and colossal bosses, visually outstanding graphics and blood and gore, Sony Santa Monica achieved the excellence inside the hack'n slash genre."
"GamingExcellence","95","The end of Kratos' vengeance was more than worth the long three-year wait. It's sure to win awards, and settle in to future ""greatest games"" countdown lists for years to come."
"Gamer Limit","95","God of War 3 not only meets the extremely high expectations of its huge, testosterone fueled fan base; it exceeds them. Every moment, from the epic opening sequence, to the final trilogy ending confrontation, is a delight to play and a pleasure to behold."
"AtomicGamer","95","It is familiar, despite its amazing additions and PS3 paint job, but if you loved the previous games, this one will rank as your new favorite."
"Gaming Target","95","God of War III, despite the final level's disappointing gameplay, felt immortal during every other hack-and-slash minute."
"Game Over Online","95","It goes without saying Kratos has etched a place for the God of War franchise in the pantheon of video games."
"Absolute Games","95","God of War 3 not only easily overshadows all of its rivals, but casts new light on the abilities of Sony's platform. Don't think that this is a quality product for the connoisseurs of the genre; God of War 3 is an achievement for the whole industry."
"Playstation Universe","95","God of War III is the best entry in the series, hands down, and one of the best action-adventure games of this generation. Kratos' journey comes to an end, along with the trilogy, in an explosion of fluid combat, mammoth environments, and a superb narrative."
"MEGamers","94","If you want revolutionary gameplay then you should stay as far away from this game as possible. But if you're looking for the same experience as the previous games intensified to a whole new level then you're in luck, because that is exactly what GoW 3 does."
"Games Master UK","94","It retains the series' hallmark action but literally turns things on its head by dropping in  dynamic landscapes that twist and turn as you fight. [May 2010, p.70]"
"IGN AU","94","Even if God of War III isn't going to cause a massive rethink on the way you play action-heavy platformers, Kratos has earned an enviable position at the head of his genre's ladder - and we don't think there's going to be another hero quite like him, in a series as consistently outstanding as this, for a very long time."
"IGN UK","94","For all God of War III's familiarity, it's a game refined with such grace and skill, there's no question that this is the absolute pinnacle of an already exhilarating series. Sure, it's a smaller, leaner beast than its predecessors but, as it happens, one that packs an absolutely unforgettable punch."
"Everyeye.it","94","God of War 3 does not represent a revolution in the genre. But it is massive, and brutal, and thrilling, like no other action game in this generation."
"Play.tm","94","Some of the most engrossing combat and visceral action the PS3 has to offer - presented expertly."
"GameWatcher","93","God of War 3 is fantastic, and has at least three scenes that are utterly magnificent. Design and gameplay-wise, it's absolutely stunning. The downside is that it doesn't have that clear cut perfection that its predecessor had; the polish shine that brilliantly lit up our eyes when we first enjoyed God of War 2."
"3DJuegos","93","God of War III is the comeback of the most bad ass hero in the history of videogames. Brutal, mega-polished and astonishingly beautiful: Sony Santa Monica has crafted a conclusion to the God of War trilogy that is really worth the wait."
"XGN","93","God of War is back and better than ever before! It's a worthy end of a trilogy. A tear for the last fight from our favourite Spartan. Let there be more Kratos in the future!"
"HellBored","93","God of War III is an exhilarating tale, and one which showcases just what a good development team can do with some predictable mechanics. Most of the other games that exist in the genre have been blasted if not into obscurity, then certainly into irrelevance. Although God of War III remains unapologetically a hack 'n' slash title, just about everything has been improved, tweaked, expanded, polished, and refined."
"PSM3 Magazine UK","93","Familiar but thrilling - sits easily among PS3's gods, if shy of the throne. [Apr 2010, p.94]"
"Pelit (Finland)","93","The gory epic is even more so this time. Playing Kratos is still pure ownage and with the exception of a few niggles the game is incredibly polished with awesome visuals. [Apr 2010]"
"IGN","93","It's not perfect, with some uneven storytelling and progression here and there, but it's still a fantastic overall package. The combat is stellar once again, it's bloodier than ever, and it is at times the best looking game ever released."
"My Gamer","92","The ending may not be the most satisfying conclusion to a trilogy, but the journey there is pure action-adventure bliss."
"NZGamer","92","God of War III is polished from (severed) head to (bloodied) toe, and is an enjoyable, ridiculous experience perfect for the moments where you just want to switch your brain off."
"Computer and Video Games","92","An epic, over-sized gorefest unlike any other. Sorry EA, Kratos is still the king of brutal brawlers."
"GameTrailers","92","It's incredibly familiar and a bit brief, but God of War III still stands as a herculean achievement. A lot of TLC went into its creation and it comes shining through at every turn. The tweaks to the gameplay are minimal and the lack of titan interaction feels like a missed opportunity, but when Kratos is swinging his hypnotizing blades it's easy to forget that the rest of the world even exists."
"Cheat Code Central","92","Everything you were expecting and more. It really delivers with extremely upgraded graphics, a quality soundtrack, easy-to-learn controls, varied weapons and powers, challenging battles, enemy diversity, plenty of boss battles, immersive puzzles, a story that ties up the loose ends, and much more. My only gripe is the lack of innovation."
"Game Revolution","91","Kratos' grim story of brutal determination and the game's overall non-stop mechanical and presentational excellence make for a gripping, gorgeous and gory experience with an unforgettably gruff, ass-kicking hero; whom the gods would destroy, they would first make bad."
"Video Game Talk","90","If you liked the previous God of War titles, you're going to feel right at home with this one."
"Level7.nu","90","God of War III is the very definition of an epic experience. The combat is brutal and fluid, the sense of scale is massive and the presentation is nothing short of amazing. Even though the third iteration of the series adds little or nothing to the original formula it's impossible not to be engulfed in this roller coaster of epic moments. A worthy conclusion to the trilogy indeed."
"Gamereactor Sweden","90","The return of Kratos is a powerful one, and the years Sony Santa Monica have spent on polishing every segment of the game have really paid off."
"Total Video Games","90","Just like the God of War games that precede it, this final installment in the trilogy isn't quite faultless even though it's excruciatingly close to a perfect score. However, it forms a trilogy that's greater than the sum of its parts."
"BigPond GameArena","90","The reality is the game delivers exactly what any fan of the games could want - epic battles, loads of gore and a plot vehicle that sees Kratos take on the mightiest characters in Greek Mythology."
"PS3bloggen.se","90","If you're after a hard-hitting and adrenaline-fueled action experience God of War III is the ultimate game on the market, and Kratos' final battle with the gods takes the genre to new heights. 44 million dollars well spent."
"Boomtown","90","The key to God of War III's success, though - continuing on from that of its predecessors - is how finely balanced it is. So expertly administered are its parts that the repetition one would expect never emerges."
"Extreme Gamer","90","'God of War III' is a triumph that lives up to the hefty expectations that the studio set for itself-- and more importantly the expectations of the hardcore crowd who has been waiting on Kratos return."
"GamesNation","90","God of War III puts a glorious end to an epic trilogy, introducing astonishing scenarios and original gameplay solutions. It is simply the best hack ‘n slash out there right now. A must-buy even if you’re not a fan of this genre!"
"Da Gameboyz","90","God of War III is not only a high definition upgrade on what is an already fantastic series; it is a game that improves on what it has done so well in the past"
"Eurogamer Spain","90","If you played the first to games in the franchise you'll like this one even more. And if you didn't, you're going to love God of War 3."
"RealGamer","90","The game is epic in scale and brutality and despite offering almost the same experience as past games key refinements and a never slowing pace mean the game provides a heart pounding experience that can't be missed."
"PALGN","90","God of War III is as brutal and suitable a conclusion as you could have possibly asked for. Kratos WILL get his revenge."
"Console Monster","90","God of War III is an epic game and a splendid conclusion to the series; its battles are fun, its bosses are huge and the task is entertaining. It is a title that all PlayStation 3 owners should own and is one of a number of impressive games recently released on the system."
"Thunderbolt","90","It takes everything that made the previous game so awesome and refines it. It continues the story, but it makes the effort to give more meaning to Kratos's journey and its eventual ending. It takes the previous established combat mechanics and makes them faster, tighter, and more fun than ever."
"Gamer.nl","90","Let there be no doubt: there couldn't have been a better end to this fantastic trilogy. Again and again your jaw will hit the floor in excitement. God of War III is so polished that the little mistakes will be all the more apparent, but it's nothing compared to what you get: an epic, well balanced action game."
"Kombo","90","Overall, this is a top notch production that will not disappoint in the slightest."
"LEVEL (Czech Republic)","90","Third time is a charm – fits perfectly to Kratos adventures. Better graphics, more gore clashes – next time there has to be a massacre in the kindergarten if they want to beat this part.  [Issue#189]"
"GamerNode","90","It's not perfect, but it's a satisfying experience from start to finish. Amazing to look at, fun to play and a great ending."
"Gamestyle","90","The game is probably the most balanced of the three, but excitement wise it never quite reaches the heights of it's predecessors."
"Playstation Official Magazine UK","90","The game is inches away from scoring 10/10, and it's only the familiarity of the core gameplay that makes it feel less than the very, very best. But it's definitely the biggest, and if this is the finale, then God of War III gives Playstation's toughest hero the send-off he deserves.   [Mar 2010, p.97]"
"GameSpot","90","Exhilarating combat and an imposing sense of scale provide a fitting end to Kratos' saga."
"Eurogamer Italy","90","God of War III is the perfect epilogue of a great trilogy. The game has no innovation, but it's gameplay is the perfect goal for the action games. Fast, epic, intense, God of War III is the perfect experience for the action gamer. Buy it, and love it!"
"Eurogamer","90","A technical marvel, but with all the clever stuff turned towards the aim of very basic gratification. There are no branching paths, no complex decisions, and no multiplayer modes, but this particular game is all the better for it, since the results are rich and focused rather than drawn-out and a little ragged. Ultimately, if you want to revel in old-school pleasures decked out in the very brightest new armour, this is about as good as it gets."
"GameZone","90","God of War III is amazing and disturbing all at once."
"TheSixthAxis","90","With creative freedom, Kratos's latest adventure is staggering in scale, superbly visualised and, for the most part, an absolute joy to play through.   And most importantly, where it counts – the action sequences – God of War III is utterly unmatched and unequaled, and therefore absolutely essential for action fans."
"GamePro","90","But as a fan who actually cares about Kratos and his plight, I found it to be a bit of a letdown. Even though I thoroughly enjoyed the journey, I can't help but feel disappointed by the way Kratos chose to say goodbye at the end of it."
"9Lives","90","God of War 3 offers blood, death, brutality – in all: fun – on a gigantic scale. Kratos wanted his revenge and it’s up to you to guide him on his blood-red journey where graphics, sound and tension come together to form a spectacle from start to finish. We cannot condone violence, but if it helps Kratos to reach his goal, there ain’t no mountain high enough, there ain’t no god strong enough. Amazing end to the trilogy."
"Play UK","88","Suitably epic and still fun to play, Kratos's last outing isn't necessarily his finest. Hindered by some tired mechanics it's not as much of a step forward as we wanted. [Issue#190, p.61]"
"InsideGamer.nl","88","God of War III ends with a bang. The trilogy end contains pretty much everything that you’ve come to expect from the series with a few surprises along the way. We wish there were a little more titan battles but overall the story of Kratos gets a worthy ending."
"Armchair Empire","85","It's a fitting end to the series (well, at least Kratos) but it remains extremely close to the lines laid down by the previous two games in both form and content so as not to upset long-time fans."
"Gameplanet","85","It's pretty much what we expect from this epic franchise, but the limited scope and fairly mundane ending hasn't rounded off this franchise with the dignity it deserves."
"The A.V. Club","83","As a technical spectacle, there's nothing like God Of War III, but while we're meant to truly feel the anguish of Kratos' bloody final battle, Sony hasn't yet trapped a ghost in the machine."
"Telegraph","80","But despite God of War III being afraid of flying too close to the sun -lest those carefully crafted wings should melt- the journey is relentlessly exciting; a blistering spectacle told in blood and thunder. Truly epic, then. And I defy anyone to argue with the definition this time around."
"Gameplayer Sweden","80","God of War III delivers the same riveting experience as its predecessors. While there isn't much innovation beyond the stunning visuals the core concept still remains sound. It's the most refined entry in the series and a worthy conclusion to the epic God of War saga."
"Edge Magazine","80","The stuff of legend, then? Indeed. Although, perhaps fittingly, one with nothing new to say. [Apr 2010, p.88]"
"Metro GameCentral","80","The end result is certainly the best of the series, with the sense of scale and superb presentation overcoming most concerns over repetition and depth."
"Giant Bomb","80","The beautiful rendering of Kratos' ugliness is what made God of War III a compelling experience for me, despite of the bits that felt unnecessarily slavish to the God of War formula. Even if it's not the best God of War game, it's unequivocally the best-looking God of War to date, and it makes for a wicked showpiece for the PlayStation 3."
"games(TM)","80","We wish that Santa Monica had focused more on the epic scale that the opening of the game promises with such conviction, rather than relying on those elements of design we've already played through twice on the PlayStation 2. [Apr 2010, p.102]"
"Kikizo","80","The highlights of this iteration are all in the technology; as potent and polished a hack-and-slasher as God of War 3 can be, the myth of its continuing relevance in design circles has worn thin. Series fans should and will invest, as there's fundamentally nothing broken here that wasn't broken before, but don't come expecting a bold rebirth, and don't come expecting the game of the year. Kratos is a frequent visitor to the Underworld; perhaps it's time he stayed there."
"GameCritics","75","The strength of the game's opening sequences and some of the bosses really stuck with me, but some of the later levels just felt kind of...bleh. As far as being the show-stopper that blows the rest of the series away, it falls short."
