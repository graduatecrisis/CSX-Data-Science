Year,Game,Review
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"Bioshock Infinite is a visionary piece of entertainment where the gameplay, characters, art style and story all come together to make what undoubtedly will be considered one of the best games of this generation."
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"Bioshock Infinite is the best shooter I have played in a long time. It is an incredible achievement artistically, narratively, and technically. I can¡¦t think of a better game to close out and define this decade-long console generation."
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"It is a triumph of artistry, technology and design. It isn¡¦t perfect, but nothing this ambitious ever is. [Issue#235]"
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"On PC, BioShock Infinite absolutely shines. The use of the venerable Unreal Engine might surprise you, considering just how stunning this game looks, especially with the high-res textures exclusive to the PC version that balloon the game to about 15GB in size."
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"BioShock is the most important new intellectual property of this hardware generation. Like its predecessor, it is an experience that could only ever be achieved in a videogame, one that demonstrates the true power of this medium to engage and inspire us, and in doing so it soars far above so many other games, clipped and blinkered as they are by their lowly, merely filmic aspirations. Irrational's achievements in BioShock Infinite dignify the medium."
2013,Bioshock Infinite,BioShock Infinite is a hell of a lot of fun to play. That really should be the only quality it needs to exhibit. The fact that it holds much more feels like an advancement of an art form. Just remember that nothing in BioShock Infinite is an attempt to be cute. Just let it tell you its story.
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"You'll see a lot of BioShock in Infinite, but even if you try to make direct comparisons between the two, it's clear that Infinite is a far better game than its predecessor. It moves at a better pace, with more meaningful and more playable big encounters than BioShock. But it still carries that sense of exploration and the feeling of dread that comes with knowing that everything is just continuing to unravel before your very eyes."
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"It was not easy to achieve the quality of the first game, but BioShock Infinite survives this ""ghost"" and evolves in every way. It¡¦s a journey not to be missed."
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"With the release of BioShock Infinite, developer Irrational has delivered a bigger story, more polished experience, and created two similar-yet-separate games that can co-exist and remain equal in quality. When the history of videogames is written, not one, but two BioShocks will be remembered for pushing gameplay, story, and subject matter to new levels."
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"It¡¦s the kind of game you¡¦ll immediately want to replay again from the beginning, not just to experiment with new vigors and weapons and tactics, or to find the backstory-expanding Voxophones and Kinetoscopes you missed on the first run-through, but to see the little bits of foreshadowing, the subtle design choices, the dropped hints that build up to the game¡¦s brain-bending denouement."
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"Everything from the pacing, to the artificial intelligence, to the graphics and the music are perfect. This is truly a masterpiece only deserving of the highest grade we can possibly give."
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"Infinite is as lavish as it is cerebral, as difficult as it is accessible. It¡¦ll be many different things to many different people, and it will be discussed, dissected and deified for many years to come...So, when will gaming have its Citizen Kane moment? Forget that. When will anything else have its BioShock Infinite moment?"
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"Any gripes with the action are washed away when the narrative flexes it considerable muscle. It¡¦s a fabulous piece of storytelling, thick with foreshadowing to a gut-punch of a finale. Most importantly, like BioShock before it, Infinite could only work as a video game, finessing the art of player agency and interaction. Proof positive that with the right talent and drive, games can plough their own narrative furrow. And excel at it."
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"To reinvent one's masterpiece without betraying its spirit nor fall into redundancy is one thing. Going as far as to pull the rug out from underneath all narrative FPS's and emotion merchants who planned to come in the coming months is another. But anyway, that wouldn't be the first impudence of BioShock Infinite. Not to fly up to Columbia and explore such a beautifully written journey would be a crime; not to meet the most alive NPC ever that is Elizabeth would be a shame."
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"I don't know how else to tell you that this is the game videogames were made for. It¡¦s the game every other designer wishes they could make. It¡¦s a watershed moment for our industry, and I¡¦d be hard pressed to tell you that anything that came before is better. More so, however, I can¡¦t imagine that anything else, in my lifetime, will top this. All bold statements, I know, but this is it and I¡¦m reviewing it. BioShock Infinite is the sort of game we dream of reviewing. It¡¦s the Ocarina of Time of this generation (only infinitely better), and will be talked about and analysed for years to come."
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"Sky-lines, the suspended tracks you can use to ride through levels like a rollercoaster, turn the first-person shooting into a first-person thrillride. It delivers a new FPS experience entirely, where you hold your breath at the apex of a sky-line before screaming down the rail so fast that no bullet can touch you. You won¡¦t have access to sky-line mobility in the lion¡¦s share of the fights--but when you do, it¡¦s an absolute rush."
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"Dealing with themes like religion, racism, and xenophobia, Columbia is a richer and more nuanced setting than even Rapture, and the unveiling of the city¡¦s culture is masterfully executed."
2013,Bioshock Infinite,Bioshock Infinite is both a breathtaking achievement in videogame storytelling and a marquee example of a game that will stick with you long after you see everything it has to offer. Calling it simply a first-person shooter is practically an insult. If you can make it through the game without being emotionally affected - or even experiencing a bit of an existential crisis - you need to check your pulse immediately.
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"As a game, BioShock Infinite has its successes and its falterings consistent with any suitably complex piece of interactive entertainment. As a story, as an exercise in drawing the player into a believable and relevant world, as proof of exactly what a videogame can mean to a person ... Well, I already said it. BioShock Infinite is damn near perfect."
2013,Bioshock Infinite,Placing bets for best game of the year? We have a solid tip for you.
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"BioShock: Infinite isn¡¦t just one of the best games of 2013, but also of the twenty-first century. The themes and storytelling are unparalleled and are approached from multiple points of view, without being at the expense of the first-person shooter-action. Besides, BioShock: Infinite is a title that gamers really needed after all these years."
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"Undoubtedly the finest game crafted by Irrational Games, BioShock Infinite is one of the best told stories of this generation. It simply cannot be missed."
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"BioShock Infinite doesn't blur the lines between your reality and the game's to quite the same extent as its predecessor, but it's a more complete and polished story, and that's the thing you'll remember."
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"For everything it has to say, for all the questions it asks ¡Xmany of which have no easy answers ¡X BioShock Infinite's big thoughts and complicated narrative don't obscure the brilliant action game that carries those messages through."
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"Bioshock Infinite is a magical experience on every level. Despite a few glitches and a couple of issues with pacing in the later parts, this game is already a clear candidate for game of the year."
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"BioShock Infinite is no doubt the most profound game I¡¦ve played in a very long time. Take from it what you will, whether it¡¦s an adrenaline pumping shooter experience or a deeper, intellectual experience or both, the almost perfect and flawless game is worth taking the time to play. This game will be rivaled by few for Game of The Year 2013."
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"The combat wore thin, the collection aspect is archaic, yet the narrative payoff is worth every hindrance. That speaks volumes to the construction of the story Ken Levine and his team at Irrational Games have achieved here."
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"BioShock Infinite is such a fun game with an incredible atmosphere. The long wait has been worth it and Irrational Games has done an incredible job at bringing Booker, Elizabeth, and Columbia to life."
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"From character clothing, to the architecture of buildings and the molding¡¦s and bits of machinery and piping that seem to have something to do with how the city is staying in the air. It fires the imagination and puts that spark into adventure once again."
2013,Bioshock Infinite,A mind blowing experience that will keep you on the edge of your seat for most of the ten-plus hours of your adventure in the beautiful sky city of Columbia.
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"The moment you step through the doorway and into Columbia, something magical happens. You¡¦re introduced to what is easily the most ""alive"" city found in a game so far."
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"Like it's ancestor, Bioshock Infinite should be in the hall of fame of videogames. Not for technical reasons, as the game is not quite top notch on that front, but it is magnificent for artistic reasons. Columbia is absolutely spectacular, as the universe does not limit itself to scripted areas, and the storyline has a real point beyond entertainment. In sharp contrast to the mass of videogames that are forgotten ten minutes after the gamers are done playing with them, Bioshock Infinite will forever impact the memories of those who have the chance to experience it. FPS fans will like the different elements of the game such as fails, airtrains and Elizabeth that allow an increase in the fight's rhythm, a vast improvement over the first Bioshock. Whether you're an intellectual or a trigger happy maniac, you will definitely find a reason to enjoy this fabulous game. Long live Bioshock Infinite."
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"A masterpiece in audiovisual design, a fantastic action game and another testimony to the craft, the imagination and the ambition of Irrational. However, the campaign is a bit shorter than what was expected and it_s obvious the studio has not reached the full range of their objectives."
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"For me BioShock: Infinite is one of the most important games in recent history. It is the first game that bravely takes on social and religious problems and doesn't avoid the opportunity to criticize extreme views. It's a great shooter, with a glorious world, fantastic co-star (Elizabeth!), unique opponents and lots of memorable characters and events. Another masterpiece from Ken Levine."
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"The PC version, as run on mid-range hardware, makes no such visual compromises, with gorgeous high-resolution textures, detailed faces, and smooth performance...A brilliant shooter that nudges the entire genre forward with innovations in both storytelling and gameplay."
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"BioShock Infinite is both art-house and grindhouse, managing to offer something for everyone. There¡¦s drama, philosophy, and shocking violence, then there¡¦s combat, abilities, and gear -- there¡¦s even numerically quantified damage for the stat-obsessed. It¡¦s enhanced by thoughtful plotting and great characters and wrapped up in a beautiful world and calamitous physics. Heady and bloody, it¡¦s a tesseract worth tackling, and even if you can see its seams from time to time, its ambition cannot be denied."
2013,Bioshock Infinite,Ken Levine's last is a truly masterpiece. Bioshock Infinite is a great action videogame with an incredible story.
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"A must-have, one of the games of the year, that gives meaning to this world of entertainment. We would have loved to see the same audiovisual ambition applied to the gameplay, or at least, some kind of attempt of bringing something new to it. Still, this is one of the masterpieces of the genre that you cannot miss."
2013,Bioshock Infinite,BioShock Infinite is simply gorgeous. When we made our first steps into the world of Columbia we were completely overwhelmed. It's a game which is only slightly let down by its very low difficulty level. The absorbing and twisting story puts BioShock Infinite on the throne of shooter gaming.
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"Play BSI slowly, relish the moments and don¡¦t rush to the end. It¡¦s certain that you will have lived one of the richest gaming experiences that, as far as narration, lyricism and story are concerned, will take a lot of time to forget! [May 2013]"
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"Ken Levine manages to combine difficult topics like guilt, atonement and racism while creating truly remarkable characters, best of all the equally charming and dangerous Elizabeth. Add to this the breathtaking visuals and tactical action (at least on the more difficult levels) and you get an extraordinary action experience."
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"Columbia is one of the most inventive and intriguing game settings of this generation, and it houses a shooter that compares with the very best. It's gaming heaven. Or the closest we'll get to it, anyway. [May 2013, p.59]"
2013,Bioshock Infinite,The story has stirred me speechless and compelled me to think.
2013,Bioshock Infinite,Infinite is incredible from a plot and artistic point of view but has several problems in terms of gameplay features. It is an excellent shooter but sadly not the best title in the franchise.
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"Slightly muddled, but it¡¦s a muddle of beautiful scenes and spectacular combat set in a breathtaking place."
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"I don¡¦t dislike BioShock Infinite (as my score attests) but Rapture was a more thoughtful, engrossing, and better assembled experience."
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"But the wonderful storyline and the memorable characters help to make the unbelievable believable. Despite the change in scenery, Columbia still exhibits the BioShock feel that was evident in Rapture."
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"It feels smashing to play it, but it¡¦s almost even more fun to watch someone else play it."
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"Bioshock is an experience that every gamer in the World should have. Irrational Games did a great job, making not the ""perfect game"" but one that could leave a mark on video games history."
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"Elizabeth is not the revolutionary AI partner you might have hoped for, but the animation work, art design, world, and narrative create a genuine connection between the player and the girl, whether or not you wipe away the debt."
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"For a while it's a frantic shooter game, then it's a touching confession, afterwards it is a parable about the ideological turmoil in America. The others would break it into pieces, but quantum physics and its creators that are hell-bent on going far than other big productions hold it firmly together."
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"This is the sort experience you don't get every day: an easy-to-like spectacle for the masses with enormous production values, but a story right out of the art-house cinema. Granted, the gameplay side doesn't do as much for this experiment as the story and world design do. But this is a balancing act the fewest of teams could pull off. And even if you have the chops, in this risk-averse day and age you still have to have a healthy dose of irrationality to go through with a game as clever as this one. No wonder Levine's team had exactly what it takes."
2013,Bioshock Infinite,A gigantic game with a layered plot full of surprises and a breathtaking setting: the city of Columbia.
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"BioShock Infinite not only reclaims the importance of the story in videogames, but also the medium's huge possibilities to create fictional worlds."
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"My conclusion after eleven hours: Bioshock Infinite is one of the best games I've ever been able to experience. My conclusion after twelve hours: What the hell? Whoever calls the finale ""unusual"" could denote the Atlantic Ocean as a ""wet"". Infinite makes me simultaneously gobsmacked, amazed and very pleased - and even after two weeks, I cannot tell you exactly which emotion prevails."
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"BioShock Infinite isn't afraid to magnify the way religious and racial extremism inform our culture and change lives. It isn't afraid to depict a less-than-holy trinity diseased by power, deception, and manipulation. As the story circles back on itself, you're left wondering whether redemption cleanses us of our atrocities, or simply invites us to commit greater ones. Once the finale comes, you will want to play again, watching each event and image through the lens of information you can never un-know. BioShock Infinite is more than just a quality game: it's an important one."
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"That Infinite can handle the collision between its philosophical concerns and its dead-end thrills without seeming hopelessly crass or overly portentous testifies to its often touching script, excellent pacing and the kind of unparalleled world building that shows you all of this coexisting cohesively in a golden city in the sky. But it also demonstrates something else: BioShock¡¦s mechanical evolution as a firstperson shooter."
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"Infinite¡¦s biggest issue is that the stiff nonplayer characters really dampen the impact of the social themes. Irrational worked so hard building this world filled with terrible racial imagery, but it¡¦s difficult to feel the effects of that when I can¡¦t relate to the mechanical mannequins that populate Columbia...It¡¦s actually a minor complaint, but it¡¦s very noticeable in a product that is otherwise so exquisitely put together."
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"A very solid, but not revolutionary shooter in an amazing setting, with a story that struggles to convey its authors¡¦ ambitions and is only seemingly complex. The vision is less focused than in previous Bioshocks and it does a worse job on binding the plot with gameplay. [CD-Action 05/2013, p.46]"
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"It¡¦s a cool setting filled with all sorts of small touches that show due care and attention paid to the fiction Irritional created and the closing 20-minutes are powerful, even if the player does little except get an extended ¡§explanation¡¨ but I'd dispute the notion that this is somehow the pinnacle of video games because there's enough that's simply average, like the actual layout of the levels (aside from sky-lines), that those making this claim are simply seeing something that isn't present in this dimension."
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"However predictable the ending of BioShock Infinite is, it is the journey that counts, and you will not go away disappointed."
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"The game is entertaining from start to finish, but it's also tragically marred by the unshakeable sense that it could have been so much more and simply got lost along the way."
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"Problematic plotting and excessive amounts of poorly balanced combat apply friction to what is otherwise one hell of a rollercoaster. [May 2013, p.80]"
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"It¡¦s the incredible world-building details that draw you into the experience of Infinite, not the shooting, which makes its predominance a shame. Irrational have made a Bioshock that is smoother to play, but less fun to play around with; built on grander ideas, but less coherent ones. It isn¡¦t a flawless second coming, but its almost peerless storytelling, imagination and attention to detail make it well worth playing."
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"Though it sometimes struggles to reconcile its genre-constrained combat with its lofty storytelling goals, BioShock Infinite exhibits ambition and a boldness of theme rarely seen in FPS titles."
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"Like Columbia itself, BioShock Infinite straddles more than one world: sometimes transcendent, often tedious. It¡¦s a game about characters choosing to lie to themselves and create the narrative they wish their lives followed, rather than succumb to reality. That¡¦s the story of the game itself, too, as Infinite often acts as though it¡¦s deeper, more groundbreaking, more willing to be relevant to the world of the player and strong enough to comment on that world, than it is."
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"It¡¦s hard to deny that the original Bioshock was praised so highly because it was so unique. Bioshock Infinite retreads a lot of the same ground, at least mechanically, but with parts that aren¡¦t nearly as diverse or varied as its predecessor...Its enemies are uninspired and its world not nearly as rich, but that still doesn¡¦t stop Bioshock Infinite having the tools to give you a great time all the same."
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"It is fascinating, and also boring. It is important, yet forgettable. Its world is enticing and unappealing. It attempts to move things forward, yet is in places stuck in the past. For a game that has the potential to open up the franchise up to a multitude of different ideas and interpretations, BioShock Infinite can feel curiously limited."
2013,GTA 5,The primary accomplishment in Grand Theft Auto V isn¡¦t gameplay. It¡¦s character. Grand Theft Auto V believes so strongly in its characters that everything else ¡X even gameplay ¡X is secondary.
2013,GTA 5,"Arguably the culmination of Rockstar¡¦s work so far, GTA V incorporates the best of their back catalogue; the car handling from Midnight Club: Los Angeles, the vast fauna-populated scrublands from Red Dead Redemption, and the gunplay and bullet time from Max Payne, folding them in to form an experience unparalleled in variety."
2013,GTA 5,"I could do all of those things, but I¡¦d rather just say that GTA V is as close to a perfection of the Grand Theft Auto formula as has been created thus far. If you have any interest at all, it should already be installing on your system."
2013,GTA 5,"At first sight just another well-executed GTA game, which is by itself a great excuse for our ultimate rating. When you look at it for a second time, you'll get the incredibly immersive and entertaining world that will not let you free. There are flaws indeed. But you know what? When you love it nothing else matters."
2013,GTA 5,"Rockstar Games have unleashed the Skyrim of third-person action games. It'll have a lasting impact through controversy, through harshly addictive gameplay, and by taking the zeitgeist of 18-36 year-old males hostage and torturing them with nipple clamps."
2013,GTA 5,"With Grand Theft Auto V Rockstar has delivered one of the most amazing and awe-inspiring games of this generation. Even if you are not a fan of the series, the incredible level of detail, the three main character switching mechanic, the bank heists and the hilarious story make this game a must."
2013,GTA 5,"Grand Theft Auto V expertly blends the best aspects of the last two major releases in the series, GTA IV and San Andreas, to set a new standard in open-world action. In a year already packed with titles that have pushed aging console hardware to new extremes, GTA V might stand as the crowning technical and design accomplishment."
2013,GTA 5,"GTA V is funny, genuinely laugh out loud funny ¡V and not in a ¡¦shoving a ten-inch purple dildo up your arse¡¦ funny ¡V the humour is told through situation, through incredibly clever writing and wonderful sense of place. Really, that says everything you need to know about GTA V. Rockstar has spent five years, and an insane amount of money, building a game that is not only bold enough to step away from expectation, but brave enough to revel in its combined history as well."
2013,GTA 5,"Grand Theft Auto V is the pinnacle of the franchise and of gaming in 2013. A ridiculously ambitious title that wrings absolutely everything out of the aging seventh-gen consoles, it's a spectacular triumph in every conceivable way. Rejoice, for Rockstar North has done it again."
2013,GTA 5,"Make no mistake: this game is beyond heavyweight. In many ways, Grand Theft Auto V is a culmination of the current generation; it¡¦s a summation of everything we¡¦ve seen in the last eight years, a love letter, if you like, to the 360 and the PS3."
2013,GTA 5,"Grand Theft Auto V is the pinnacle of open-world video game design and a colossal feat of technical engineering. It takes a template laid down by its predecessors and expands upon it, improving on and streamlining some of its rougher aspects. It doesn¡¦t break out of that template and can be brash, nasty and nihilistic. But for all its more unsavoury aspects, this is a game built with skilled mechanical expertise and creative artistry."
2013,GTA 5,"The genius of GTA V is in the sheer seductive force of its vision. The visuals are astonishing ¡V just astonishing. Surely pushing this ageing hardware to the limits, we get the dense downtown with its soaring skyscrapers and murky, rubbish-strewn back alleys. But then out into the country, we have rolling grasslands and desert stretches, coyotes roaming, the shadows of eagles swooping overhead...The world drags you in. It begs you to explore ¡V and then it rewards you."
2013,GTA 5,"When analyzed in its purest essence, GTA V not only proves to be an excellent title, but also a game that is able to make a sublime parody of today's society, taking advantage of all the excesses and insanities to which the world is slowly getting used."
2013,GTA 5,"GTA V is not only bigger and funnier than the amazing Niko Bellic¡¦s tragedy, it's also better. With a ton of mission variety, amazing visuals and fantastic gameplay, this is the biggest game ever made."
2013,GTA 5,"Memorable missions, barnstorming heists, amusing side objectives and an almost impossibly immersive world to explore, make for the best Grand Theft Auto since Vice City and San Andreas."
2013,GTA 5,"Getting through the main story in a timely manner was a challenge in itself, but in that time I found that GTA V was possibly the most well-paced open world game I have ever played. I never felt like I didn¡¦t have something to do and as of right now, I¡¦m going right back in to do it all over again. I¡¦ve been with GTA since the beginning way back in ¡¥97, and it feels like GTA V is the culmination of everything we love about the series: It¡¦s big, it¡¦s pretty, and most importantly it¡¦s just nonstop fun."
2013,GTA 5,"With a great cast, a huge list of missions and activities, some novel new gameplay additions and one of the most stunning environments we've ever explored, Grand Theft Auto 5 is a masterpiece and a hugely impressive technological achievement."
2013,GTA 5,"The world is massive and detailed, the gameplay is damn near perfect, and though there are some lackluster side missions, the actual story is filled with memorable personalities that feel more fully-realized than even the best of GTA's previous characters."
2013,GTA 5,"Sam Houser compared the making of Rockstar¡¦s epic to the troubled production of Francis Ford Coppola¡¦s Apocalypse Now, and in some ways the same result has been met: a product that represents the peak of the blockbuster triple-A form, that realises grand ambition without visible compromise."
2013,GTA 5,"The fifth game in the series combines the delusions of grandeur facilitated by the most detailed open world to date to super-solid shooting and driving mechanics. Previous lengths have been traded in for a consistently captivating narrative which not only holds everything together, but really makes this game seem more than the sum of its parts. The only remaining question is: Where will ¡V or can ¡Vthe series go from here? I am looking forward to finding out."
2013,GTA 5,"Rockstar revolutionizes gaming once again, implementing three playable characters whilst further pushing the limits of the criminal life in a virtual playground."
2013,GTA 5,"The quality of GTA V puts to shame 99% of triple A productions. The story is beautiful, the graphics are unbelievable for the old hardware they run on, and most importantly the gameplay is fun and smooth. GTA V is not afraid to show it is a videogame, and has the guts to trade some of its realism for the sake of fun."
2013,GTA 5,"GTA V feels like a next-gen game without actually being one. If all the other studious could do what Rockstar can, there'd be plenty of life left in the current console generation. But that's the thing, isn't it. No other developer is like Rockstar. And no other series is like Grand Theft Auto."
2013,GTA 5,"GTA V represents the videogame at its finest. Tense and dramatic when it wants, joyful and surprising when the player wants it. Rockstar has managed to harmonize the different trends in the saga, managing to create an unforgettable experience that will be enjoyed for a long time to come."
2013,GTA 5,A staggering technical achievement that is matched only by the depth and ambition of its gameplay ¡V this is not only the best-looking GTA ever but by far the most fun to play.
2013,GTA 5,"Unless you play it for yourself, it's near impossible to grasp how big GTA 5 is. It's not just the world. It's the gargantuan story, the sheer amount of missions and the variety introduced with them, the activities to take part in, or the secrets waiting to be unveiled. It's a highlight of the generation."
2013,GTA 5,It features arguably the best story of the series that¡¦s greatly enhanced by the added dynamic of three contrasting protagonists.
2013,GTA 5,"Grand Theft Auto V is not only a preposterously enjoyable video game, but also an intelligent and sharp-tongued satire of contemporary America. It represents a refinement of everything that GTA IV brought to the table five years ago."
2013,GTA 5,"From skydiving and submarine exploration to bounty-hunting and watching animated shorts, GTA V is absolutely crammed full of things to do, and it looks amazing while you do them."
2013,GTA 5,"Rockstar's Xbox 360 swansong is probably the console's greatest technical achievement, and as such it's unmissable."
2013,GTA 5,Is Grand Theft Auto V the best game of the year? Easily. Is it the best game of this current generation of consoles? Definitely ¡V and it¡¦s quite possibly the best video game yet. I say this after playing it for ¡§only¡¨ 20 hours.
2013,GTA 5,"No one makes worlds like Rockstar, but at last it has produced one without compromise. Everything works. It has mechanics good enough to anchor games of their own, and a story that is not only what GTA has always wanted to tell but also fits the way people have always played it. It¡¦s a remarkable achievement, a peerless marriage of world design, storytelling and mechanics that pushes these ageing consoles to the limit and makes it all look easy."
2013,GTA 5,"Grand Theft Auto V is one of the best sandboxes that video games have to offer. Where massive worlds often are plagued by boring missions and lifeless areas, Rockstar has managed to make an incredibly engaging game that still retains a humongous and lively world."
2013,GTA 5,The writing associated with those main characters and their stories is the best part of Grand Theft Auto V.
2013,GTA 5,"There¡¦s no better time than this to use the word masterwork: Rockstar did a colossal job creating a huge, visually stunning world chiseled in its finest details, populated by brilliant characters and with highly spectacular and varied gameplay."
2013,GTA 5,"No game can match its mix of scale, direction and quality - and we don't know when one might. [Dec 2013, p.52]"
2013,GTA 5,The world of Grand Theft Auto V is undeniably a masterpiece and has set a very high bar for sandbox gaming not only for this generation but for the next gen which is so closely upon us. Beyond the game¡¦s story line you¡¦ll be able to put in hundreds of hours just wandering the city streets and never be bored doing so.
2013,GTA 5,Rockstar Games has managed to exceed my expectations and create one of the best games of this generation.
2013,GTA 5,"Grand Theft Auto 5 defines what we want out of a free-roam action game. It also outshines all of its predecessors in every possible way, because it perfects the familiar formula and takes it to new heights."
2013,GTA 5,"For the anarchist, GTA5 is quite a playground. The entire map is available once you get through an hour or so of the story, and the tools of destruction are numerous and hugely enjoyable, although some of them might need to be unlocked first. The Gatling gun returns and a gas canister spills a solid line of flammable justice waiting to be set off. Guns can be painted up and modded with flashlights, grips, scopes, and suppressors."
2013,GTA 5,"The standout factor for Grand Theft Auto V is that each character not only offers a unique perspective on the GTA world in which you¡¦re taking part, but on gaming as a whole. Franklin is new to the ¡¥game¡¦ -- he looks sharp and listens and learns. Michael is as I¡¦ve painted him to be: a reluctant master in an ever-changing dojo clinging to a wall of arbitrary yet important-to-him trophies, while Trevor is the wild side in every gamer (thanks Joab) -- the sort of yes-man we inevitably become because pain and reward exist on a blurred precipice in modern narrative-driven gaming."
2013,GTA 5,"The narrative fails to match the impact John Marston or Niko Bellic's tales, but the colorful characters kept me interested in the story nonetheless. Like the golden state it parodies, Grand Theft Auto V is filled with beautiful scenery, a wealth of activities, and the promise of fortune."
2013,GTA 5,GTA V continues the game series' tradition of raising the bar for open world action games.
2013,GTA 5,"Tons of gameplay hours, plenty of missions and activities with an awesome collection of vehicles of various modes of transportation and a large array of firearms put the grandeur once again into Grand Theft Auto."
2013,GTA 5,GTA5¡¦s main single player story mode delivers the best Grand Theft Auto experience to date.
2013,GTA 5,"Even a die-hard detractor of the Grand Theft Auto series (yes, that's me) is forced to admit that ""V"" is one sweet game. In fact, it's one of the best of this generation. [Oct 2013]"
2013,GTA 5,"I can¡¦t imagine the pressure behind the scenes, but everything that Rockstar has attempted with Grand Theft Auto V gels together perfectly. As we look forward to the next-generation launches in just a few months, it¡¦s pretty awesome to see the best game of this entire generation cap it off."
2013,GTA 5,"Rockstar has expanded and improved upon so much of what's special about video games as mainstream spectacles, from the playful use of characters to the refined take on world design. The developer's progress makes the aspects of the game left in cultural stasis ¡X the poorly drawn women, the empty cynicism, the unnecessarily excessive cruelty ¡X especially agitating."
2013,GTA 5,"The most amazing thing about this criminal saga is not only its scale, but that it perfectly works on several levels. Spine-tingling driving, fun missions, excellent dialogue, fully fleshed characters, vicious satire on pretty much everythingÿ One play-through is not enough to appreciate GTA 5 in all its multi-layered glory."
2013,GTA 5,"Its problems range from finicky little things like twitchy helicopter flying controls to much larger issues, such as unsettling bits of cruelty that don¡¦t always register as satire, or the still-unsolved challenge of maintaining any sense of plot urgency in a game where players are free to abandon the storyline and spend hours skyjacking blimps, tooling around in a submarine or taking in-game smartphone selfies and posting them online."
2013,GTA 5,"Despite all these accomplishments and additions though, GTA V isn¡¦t a huge leap forward for Rockstar. Instead, it¡¦s an evolution of all their previous work, all combined into one sandbox experience on a massive scale. But it¡¦s a satisfying path that the franchise has taken, kicking other genre games off the throne that it helped build."
2013,GTA 5,"Although it does suffer from a few problems that have plagued the franchise since the beginning, the improved driving controls, captivating leads, and the sprawling city of Los Santos should win the hearts of any open world fan out there."
2013,GTA 5,"An ambitious game, attempting to meld three very different characters together to tell one encompassing story of survival in what amounts to the worst place in America. That story stumbles, but the open-ended gameplay remains a showpiece for the vast amount of content that can be poured into a virtual world."
2013,GTA 5,"All three characters, in their respective ways, feel representative of the Grand Theft Auto series as a whole, and contribute to making GTA V what it is -- the ultimate culmination of Rockstar's beloved and despised series."
2013,GTA 5,"When you¡¦re dealing with disturbing subjects ranging from life-destroying drug addiction to creepy cult organizations to legitimately psychopathic behaviour, the jokes go down a little easier if you get the sense that the writers penned their quips with an aim to make you think about why you¡¦re laughing...True satire happens in Grand Theft Auto V, just not nearly as often as I¡¦d like."
2013,GTA 5,"Grand Theft Auto V offers one of the best sandbox experiences ever,filled to the brink with stuff to do. The vistas are magnificent andamazing stuff just seems to happen wherever you go. But at the sametime the story is tired and the characters unoriginal. Yourappreciation of Grand Theft Auto V will depend of what you want out ofthe series. The freedom and joy of discovery is hard to beat butthe rest still has some ways left to go."
2013,GTA 5,"Even with as many downs as ups, Grand Theft Auto V is still a significant achievement in design. Playing missions from multiple perspectives is a creative spark that will surely light up the next generation, and I'm confident the Housers have even bigger ambitions. They'll keep building upon this template and inch tantalizingly closer to creating their perfect game. GTA5 isn't it, but its flashes of brilliance will endure."
2013,GTA 5,"It is the difference between The Godfather Part 1 and Part 2, between Inglorious Basterds and Triumph of the Will, and between Just Cause 2 and JFK Reloaded. In the former examples, the audience can get behind the anti-heroes depicted for whatever reason and condone their admittedly awful actions, but in the latter group, the subject matter or the protagonist's morals are skewed too far from the norm to be comfortably witnessed. That's what it's like to play Grand Theft Auto V. The three men you take control of throughout the game aren't even anti-heroes. They're just scumbags."
2013,Mario 3D,"While not as revolutionary as Mario 64 or Galaxy, 3D World manages to feel simultaneously fresh and nostalgic in a way the New Super Mario Bros. series never quite realized."
2013,Mario 3D,"You wanted a reason to buy a Wii U? Here you go. [March 2014, p.67]"
2013,Mario 3D,"A mastery of games design, Super Mario 3D World shows that Nintendo are still on top of their game. Blending the old and the new into platforming gold, this is everything we could¡¦ve wanted and more. The reason to own a Wii U has arrived."
2013,Mario 3D,"As usual, expect pure gameplay with a lot of amazing ideas, both old and new, thrown in the mix. Currently the best game available for the system. [Issue#237]"
2013,Mario 3D,"It¡¦s fun, it¡¦s fast and it¡¦s the best multiplayer experience on the Wii U!"
2013,Mario 3D,"In the end, everything comes down to the incredible level design and the pure joy of playing. Super Mario 3D World makes 3D Land seem like a prototype. It's a product from a team at its creative peak - it's Mario in its purest essence."
2013,Mario 3D,It¡¦s a masterpiece.
2013,Mario 3D,"A peerless title full of virtuosity and richness that combines the tight mechanics of old school games with sophisticated formal experimentation, full of liberty, complexity and mastery that reminds us that art has no limits."
2013,Mario 3D,"It's more than just a simple Mario title with multiplayer bolted on. The game weaves together a plethora of unique, compelling and occasionally downright bizarre ideas that simply work."
2013,Mario 3D,"Super Mario 3D World is a master class in platforming fun, and deserves every bit of praise heaped upon it."
2013,Mario 3D,"It really is a fantastic game. That thrill of hitting the top of the flagpole is still there after all these years, Mario and co leap about at the top of their game, it's colourful, friendly, joyful, and the most fun I've had with a platform game since Super Mario Galaxy 2."
2013,Mario 3D,Super Mario 3D World is a great game full of amazing games inside. The boundaries of the imagination were again overcome and the strong interactivity and magnificent achievements in technical terms prevails.
2013,Mario 3D,"World might not be the same revelation that Super Mario 64 or Super Mario Galaxy were, but it doesn't look at traditions as a crutch, and instead uses what you know as a way to delight and entertain."
2013,Mario 3D,Super Mario 3D World justifies a Wii U.
2013,Mario 3D,"To some, Super Mario may appear tired: a mascot whom Nintendo trots out every few years to sell another console with repackaged but fundamentally stale ideas. Super Mario 3D World is a fierce rebuttal to the accusation. Mario and his makers once again assert their dominance of spatial navigation games, displaying a rude abundance of ideas to delight, surprise and celebrate innocence and playfulness."
2013,Mario 3D,"A triumph from start to finish. Beautiful, colourful, amusing, and bereft of any cynicism whatsoever. An utter breath of fresh air that plays like a dream; this is almost certainly the game Nintendo should have launched the Wii U with. However, here we are, finally getting the incredible Mario title we deserve."
2013,Mario 3D,"Once again, Nintendo completely re-defines platforming with the latest Mario installment. This is the game to buy a Wii U for and co-op will probably never be much more fun than this."
2013,Mario 3D,"The closest we will ever come to a perfect Mario game, one that is a culmination of every right decision ever made in the series. Alone, or with friends, the first time, or the tenth time, it does everything right. It's a wonderful adventure."
2013,Mario 3D,"It's platforming perfection, brimming with clever ideas and flawless execution."
2013,Mario 3D,"Super Mario 3D World is both gorgeous and about as enjoyable as a video game can be. There is an immense amount of depth that kept me coming back for more, time and time again. This is the rare type of game that I believe ten years down the road we will be coming back and playing again and again. It¡¦s that good."
2013,Mario 3D,"Put simply, Super Mario 3D World is stunning. Its world is beautiful, its design is impeccable, and its fun is infectious. I'm running out of superlatives here, so let me finish where I started: Go play it."
2013,Mario 3D,"Super Mario 3D World can be easily summarised ¡X it¡¦s a terrifically enjoyable, tight and impeccably structured experience. It recalls the mascot¡¦s 3D heritage while providing the perfect starting point for those that prefer 2D platforming, catering to an audience of beginners and skilled veterans alike. Nintendo¡¦s also mastered Mario multiplayer for, arguably, the first time; it¡¦s still manic and can be either co-operative or competitive, but there¡¦s also a sense of space that allows determined groups to progress coherently."
2013,Mario 3D,"Thankfully 3D World isn¡¦t just a refinement of the Mario formula, it¡¦s a powerful re-imagining. It¡¦s an explosive cavalcade of color and excitement as well as a well thought out evolution of Mario."
2013,Mario 3D,"It was then that I realized that Super Mario 3D World had achieved a level of platforming design that's close to perfection, and there was almost never a moment where I didn't have a smile on my face. This is the unequivocally the best Mario game since Galaxy 2, and it shows up anything the ""New"" series has ever done, and then some."
2013,Mario 3D,"Compact by the standards of the Galaxy adventures but still loaded with bountiful secrets, beneath the warm familiarity of 3D World lies one of the strangest Mario games in years - or at least one of the most random in its influences and its moment-to-moment indulgences. And that's a very, very good thing."
2013,Mario 3D,"The game is breathtakingly simple, polished to perfection, and tonnes of fun - by yourself or with friends. The only reason it¡¦s not getting a perfect 10 is because I miss the story elements, and some of the bosses were just far too easy to overcome."
2013,Mario 3D,"There is no doubt that this is the best game available on the Wii U system to date, and in my opinion it may just be the best game in Super Mario history. Make no ¡¥ifs¡¦ ¡¥ands¡¦ or ¡¥buts¡¦ about it, Super Mario 3D World is a must buy as it is the game Wii U owners have been waiting for."
2013,Mario 3D,"It is beautiful. It sounds amazing. Its controls are perfect. It loves you with its pacing and variety, and it never wants you to get bored."
2013,Mario 3D,"Super Mario 3D World is another fantastic example of what it means to be a Nintendo game. If you have a Wii U, you can't miss this one."
2013,Mario 3D,"It fulfills the promise of a multiplayer Mario much better than anything that the Japanese game maker has done before. Super Mario 3D World is marvelous, and its constant variety and fantastic light-hearted co-op play proves that Nintendo still knows exactly how to tweak their Mario formula in fun ways."
2013,Mario 3D,"Endlessly creative, relentlessly delightful and eminently playable by all levels of player, SM3DW is perhaps the best 3D platformer released since the series¡¦ heyday."
2013,Mario 3D,"A game with heart. That's such a rare thing these days, but Nintendo still seems to be able to create wonders. Super Mario 3D World is an amazing platform, with brilliant levels and quite a few surprises. Wii U needed a killer app? Here it is."
2013,Mario 3D,"Super Mario 3D World is another masterpiece in the history of platform games, successfully achieving the mission to build a bridge between the 2D and 3D Mario history. With gorgeous visuals, perfectly oiled mechanisms and lots to be unlocked and discovered, it stands as the best Wii U game to date."
2013,Mario 3D,"Super Mario 3D World is much more than the console big brother to 3D Land, incorporating the series¡¦ every idea into a well-tempered concoction of imagination fueled by jumps and 1-ups for a new experience that transcends nostalgia to enter the realm of the sublime."
2013,Mario 3D,"Super Mario 3D World is a masterclass of game design, and the result of decades of iteration and improvement ¡X which makes its overall brevity that much more painful."
2013,Mario 3D,"Super Mario 3D World is one of the best Mario games. It's a perfect mix between New Super Mario Bros co-op, 3D Land platforming experience and some of the best skills of other franchise games. This game has one of the most varied and brilliant level design that we remember in any EAD Tokyo development."
2013,Mario 3D,"Super Mario 3D World takes the excellent gameplay from its 3DS predecessor and expands upon it with 4-player co-op, new gameplay and even more creative levels. Mario's first 3D, HD adventure is bar none the best game on Wii U right now and the console's undisputed killer app. Whether played solo or with friends, it is a master class of platformer design and more importantly, one hell of a good time."
2013,Mario 3D,"For any Mario fans worried their favorite paesano plumber wasn¡¦t about innovation anymore, Super Mario 3D World shows the franchise that created the platforming standard continues to set the bar. The new Super Bell and Double Cherry power-ups augment the Mario experience in a brilliant, meaningful way, and the Wii U¡¦s HD capabilities deliver the prettiest-looking game in series history."
2013,Mario 3D,"Mario Galaxies have finally gotten the follow up they so rightfully deserve. Fun, exciting and surprising, Super Mario 3D World is everything a good platformer needs to be. [Dec 2013]"
2013,Mario 3D,"Any Mario game runs the risk of the final encounter being too traditional or featuring a frustrating gimmick, but this one brought a smile to everyone¡¦s faces on my co-op team from beginning to end. While it¡¦s not the most difficult challenge, it is suitably epic and entertaining ¡V an exceptional finisher to an excellent entry in the series."
2013,Mario 3D,"Not so much a baby step into HD 3D platforming as a triple backflip onto a Goomba's dome. A constant source of joy, surprise and ideas, ideas, ideas."
2013,Mario 3D,"It's not a game that'll single-handedly save the Wii U, but it is a typically brilliant, typically Nintendo experience - and one that'll live in the memory long after the final flag pole has disappeared from view. [Jan 2014, p.45]"
2013,Mario 3D,"Under a thick layer of polish and charm, you¡¦ll find yet another top-notch platforming adventure, chocked full of secrets and clever twists and about as challenging as anything Mario has thrown our way thus far. It isn¡¦t groundbreaking or approaching the level of perfection that the Galaxy games did, but if nothing else, it¡¦s a must-have title for Wii U owners."
2013,Mario 3D,"The best Wii U game. The title the console needed at launch. Beautiful, fun, clever... A must-have if you like platformers, and a good reason to consider buying the console if you don't have it already."
2013,Mario 3D,"This game was yet another solid, fun-for-days title in the Mario series."
2013,Mario 3D,Super Mario 3D World is not only a great Wii U game. It¡¦s a great reason to buying the whole system. Everything from the graphics to the controls is sculpted to perfection. It¡¦s also one of the best co-op games we¡¦ve played in a long time.
2013,Mario 3D,"Super Mario 3D World is a joy from beginning to end, and is the best game for the Wii U so far."
2013,Mario 3D,"It's one of those games that only Nintendo is capable of delivering. If you own a Wii U, this is the best Christmas present you can get for you and your friends or family."
2013,Mario 3D,"Super Mario 3D World is a must-own title for every Wii U-gamer out there. It's fun, fast and only occasionally let down by minor quirks. Whether you play it alone or with friends: Mario 3D World is a romp."
2013,Mario 3D,"While Mario may have stumbled a bit in his last few releases, Super Mario 3D World proves that Nintendo is still one of the finest makers of platform games out there. Everything from the visuals, the music, character animation and level design is incredibly well thought out and implemented, and it is one of those games that's worth buying a Wii U to play."
2013,Mario 3D,"Super Mario 3D World is not only a fantastic game in and of itself, it's a mandatory buy for any Wii U owner."
2013,Mario 3D,"Traditional Mario, who perfects all the possible aspects of the plumbing trade. Indeed, this is not a revolution, but you will be frequently surprised, and you will never be bored in his company."
2013,Mario 3D,"Super Mario World 3D pares back some of the complexity seen in recent Mario games in favour of multiplayer gaming, and it works wonderfully."
2013,Mario 3D,"Super Mario 3D World is vibrant, fun and reaches a new level of excellence for the franchise, creating the right kind of cat-astrophe."
2013,Mario 3D,"Super Mario 3D World is a sublime Mario adventure. Finding the three stars and one stamp every level contains quickly becomes an obsession, which is a result of Nintendo's brilliant level design."
2013,Mario 3D,"Super Mario 3D World is filled with dynamic, creative and varied levels that we've gotten used to with the Galaxy-games. The result is a fantastic platformer, that not only plays like a dream, but also is a pleasure to simply observe."
2013,Mario 3D,"All told, Super Mario 3D World is a difficult game to pigeonhole. It borrows elements from multiple Mario games and ends up creating something new in the combination. It¡¦s not as profound as Super Mario 64 but it¡¦s still an interesting expansion of the Mario experience. 3D World is full of smart ideas and everything works."
2013,Mario 3D,"There is tremendous variety to Super Mario 3D World. It¡¦s a game that mashes a thousand clever, creative ideas into one cohesive whole, which of course comes under the Mario umbrella."
2013,Mario 3D,"Simply put, if you own a Wii U and love Mario, then you should definitely pick it up."
2013,Mario 3D,"Charming, varied and almost perfectly balanced: This is pure platforming fun."
2013,Mario 3D,"After the not-so-original New Super Mario Bros games, it is lovely to see Mario and his friends in an adventure that is truly worth playing. The vast range of power-ups is great, especially the catsuit which makes Mario not only adorable looking, but also handy. His claws are an awesome extra to fight the fun, new enemies. It is a pity that this game is a bit easy, but you can challenge yourself by playing co-op with annoying friends or go on a green star hunt. It's not Mario Galaxy, but very surprising and of very high quality like we know of that plumber."
2013,Mario 3D,"While I¡¦d still like to see a proper 3D Mario game on Wii U, 3D World does so much right that it¡¦s hard to bash the formula, especially when it veers off course so often."
2013,Mario 3D,"Super Mario 3D World is not only the essential videogame Wii U so desperately needed, it's another master class in gameplay design by Nintendo."
2013,Mario 3D,"This is a game you need to own a Wii U for. There¡¦s enough new that it shouldn¡¦t be seen as a rehash of past glories, and there is a wealth of variety crammed into the game."
2013,Mario 3D,Super Mario 3D World is without a doubt the most important work of rewriting the classical dynamics of the series since the days of the Nintendo 64.
2013,Mario 3D,"Probably the best option to enjoy Wii U nowadays. It lacks difficulty, online options are conservative and it hasn't any competitive modes, but it's pure Mario fun, with multiplayer and cats. Definitely, the Mario game this console needs."
2013,Mario 3D,"Super Mario 3D World might not be a ¡§game changer¡¨ like Super Mario 64, but it¡¦ll always be remembered as the one that let the cats out."
2013,Mario 3D,"3D World sees the plumber at the top of his game, and it¡¦s finally as fun to play with friends as it is solo. It doesn¡¦t redefine the franchise like previous entries have, but when the total package is as fun as 3D World, that¡¦s hardly a complaint."
2013,Mario 3D,"Super Mario 3D World is a tightly-designed platformer, raucously fun in multiplayer, and a master's class in level design. Don't pass it off as just another Mario game. This one is not to be missed."
2013,Mario 3D,"It gets the balance right between nostalgic touches and clever new twists, and never once let me down with a boring boss or too-familiar retread. In all my years of playing with the Mario gang, I've never been quite so happy to hurl myself into the unknown, and 3D World delivers challenge, surprise and joy in almost every moment."
2013,Mario 3D,"The fact that 3D World remains lively and interesting despite calling back to so many well-loved classics serves as a succinct reminder as to why Mario remains successful after so many years and so many games: At its heart, the series is ultimately just about having simple, unpretentious fun."
2013,Mario 3D,"Easily the best game on the Wii U and one that can proudly stand alongside Nintendo¡¦s greatest, even if it doesn¡¦t quite top the Super Mario Galaxy games."
2013,Mario 3D,"This is Mario like you¡¦ve never seen him before, and unlike so many of his next-gen rivals, he nips along at an effortless 60fps. If the true measure of new hardware¡¦s worth is how stark the difference is between it and what came before, then this is the most next-gen game that 2013 has yet produced."
2013,Mario 3D,"With a secret world so good it'll make long-term fans (and me) squeal with glee, and how easily it oozes personality and skill, Super Mario 3D World is the best entry the series has offered up in years. It may not hit the highest of highs that the plumber has done in the past, but it's awfully close."
2013,Mario 3D,"Everything that you can see and do within its enchanting levels is so bright, colourful, and full of wonder that it's impossible not to be taken in by its charms."
2013,Mario 3D,"Super Mario 3D World is simply awesome. With this game Miyamoto has changed many elements of both the historical gameplay and level design of Super Mario, crafting a brand new but still nostalgic experience. Rayman Legends is still the best platformer available on Nintendo Wii U, but 3D World is a gorgeous runner up."
2013,Mario 3D,"Super Mario 3D World is a strong and beautiful sequel to 3D Land, but after the amazing heights of the Galaxy games this console platformer feels somewhat more like a step back: the gameplay doesn't allow for many new elements anymore. Despite that disappointment, 3D World is a varied and balanced adventure where newcomers and veterans alike will find many hours of good old fashioned fun."
2013,Mario 3D,"Super Mario 3D World is using mechanics from another century, but is Nintendo to blame if old recipes still work? The risk-taking stays minimal, and the core gamers will mostly enjoy the two last worlds in spite of a difficulty level that has improved significantly. Impossible to forget the level design and the precision of the gameplay, which defines the game. Even the multiplayer mode is good in spite of some camera problems. Nintendo set everything to perfection and most players should enjoy this Super Mario 3D World."
2013,Mario 3D,"The game is at odds with itself for not being as inventive as it should be, but being so good because of all invention that's come before it. Mario, in this sense, is his own worst enemy."
2013,Mario 3D,"Super Mario 3D World combines the best of both worlds, offering a solid solo mode, deep in its gameplay mechanics as its content, and an exciting multiplayer, friendly fun, packed with inspired 3D levels."
2013,Mario 3D,"Super Mario 3D World is a very good Mario game that suffers only in that the unrealized potential for it to have been a great game, period, keeps peeking in between the cracks. Fun to play for veterans and newcomers alike either as a single-player challenge or frenetic multiplayer party-brawl; and a definite must for current and prospective WiiU owners."
2013,Mario 3D,"I'm sure some players will get a kick out of throwing each other into pits or causing chaos in a cat suit, but 3D World stands squarely in the shadow of other, greater entries in the series."
2013,Mario 3D,"If you¡¦ve sampled a wider range of platformers, and if you don¡¦t have an inherent predilection for Mario worlds, Super Mario 3D World will proceed like a pleasant enough curiosity. It¡¦s a bit like hearing oldies on a radio station. It¡¦s familiar and safe. Then it¡¦s over and out of your head entirely, leaving you room to discover new and better music."
2013,The Last of Us,"As a game, The Last of Us will occasionally falter. Imperfect underwater mechanics and careless friendly AI that insists on blocking your path or causing unnecessary firefights can irk, but they are very minor niggles and should be treated as such. Because as an experience, The Last of Us is powerful, emotionally draining and absolutely one of the finest games of this generation. [August 2013, p70]"
2013,The Last of Us,"The Last of Us is a sobering conclusion to Naughty Dog¡¦s relationship with the PlayStation 3. It is the studio¡¦s finest game to date, marrying gameplay and fiction better than any of the Uncharted games. It¡¦s sometimes haunting, sometimes beautiful, but more than anything else it feels real, and both you and Joel are very much vulnerable to it."
2013,The Last of Us,It's not a big surprise the game is good. Surprising is it's even better than anyone would have thought. A beautiful and atmospheric game with many moments only Alzheimer will hide them from you. [Issue#231]
2013,The Last of Us,"There was no violence for violence sake, everything felt like it was done with perfect context. The writers and those that acted in the game all deserve a lot of credit, it was one of the most amazing experiences I have ever had with a controller in my hands."
2013,The Last of Us,"The Last of Us is the type of game that could only be crafted by a developer willing to take risks. Were Naughty Dog to have thrown its money at yearly iterations of Uncharted, it would likely still have found its audience, but with The Last of Us it has struck out in a bold new direction that asks some very big questions about some of the fundamental aspects of videogame culture and the relationship that exists between gamer and game."
2013,The Last of Us,The Last of Us is a masterful tale of two individuals who are both authentic and flawed. It creates one of the most memorable video game experiences I have ever played and I believe its the best game to come out in the last ten years.
2013,The Last of Us,The Last of Us is truly what a game can aspire to. It¡¦s a full interactive experience package.
2013,The Last of Us,It effectively closes out this generation on a high note while simultaneously raising expectations for gaming storylines and their presentation in the next console generation.
2013,The Last of Us,"The game hits all the right notes and proves that Naughty Dog really knows how to design interesting, gorgeous and enjoyable games."
2013,The Last of Us,"At the end of the day, one detail is all that matters about the The Last of Us: its single-player campaign. Naughty Dog has taken what it¡¦s learnt from crafting the Uncharted franchise and spun that experience into a more down-to-earth, realistic adventure that shines with storytelling excellence, great combat, tense atmosphere and the highest quality in presentation, making The Last of Us one of Sony¡¦s best exclusives for the PS3¡¦s ever-growing library of great games."
2013,The Last of Us,A masterpiece of storytelling and modern game design.
2013,The Last of Us,"Cutting your teeth on astonishingly good-looking and immaculately presented fluff pieces and then going ahead to produce arguably the darkest game of this generation ¡V that's the sort of trick only the real heavyweights can pull off. Naughty Dog's game ain't begging for sympathy, it doesn't care if you like it or not. As such, it's a wake-up call for the medium, determined that the line isn't drawn between good and evil or right and wrong, but between you and the others."
2013,The Last of Us,"Naughty Dog has proven itself again as one of the most accomplished development teams in the world. With The Last of Us they have given us a consistent and interesting world that is supported by practically all of its game mechanics. From the rich complex combat system to the sublime sound design, this game immerses the player in one of the most visceral plots in this generation. Maybe the AI could have been better, but, overall, this game proves how far the craftsmanship of making video games has come."
2013,The Last of Us,"In atmosphere and narrative, Naughty Dog knows few barriers, and turning their talent and craftsmanship to such haunting and profound subject matter will ensure that the developer is poised to continue its dominance as a premier auteur development studio well into the next generation of console hardware."
2013,The Last of Us,"Is it possible for a title of a dying platform to become a game of the year? The Last of Us is a hot candidate not because it has amazing graphics, but because it has a solid storyline for the generic post-apocalyptic genre. The game proves in a remarkable way that even a great thing may be even greater, and that a whole thing may be even more than just a sum of the individual components."
2013,The Last of Us,"With The Last of Us, developer Naughty Dog has not only created a modern classic, but also one of the finest gaming experiences of all time. The fact that they set a new bar for interactive storytelling almost seems like a bonus."
2013,The Last of Us,"The Last of Us is not a cheerful story, but it's a damned good one."
2013,The Last of Us,"An assured, touching, and engrossing adventure, The Last of Us represents a watershed moment for the medium. The unlikely bond that blossoms between the title¡¦s two lead characters is both heartrending and poignantly paced ¡V but the release delivers much more than captivating cinematics. This is a meaty slice of survival action that masterfully depicts the horrors of life in a post-pandemic setting."
2013,The Last of Us,"Here the developers have carefully pieced together something rarely seen in the industry ¡V a considerably more substantial, meaty take on the saturated third person adventure genre, and one that surprises at every turn without wrong-footing a player ready to invest serious time and emotion into the project. A real achievement, and one that respects you as an adult."
2013,The Last of Us,"It would be disingenuous to suggest that The Last of Us is immune from blockbuster video game excess --the total number of kills at the final stats page will still run into the many hundreds-- but it¡¦s one of the few games to try and make some kind of sense of it without compromising its quality of action...In that, and so many other things, The Last of Us is a triumph."
2013,The Last of Us,"It¡¦s a hallmark of excellence in writing, design, and performance. Naughty Dog and Sony not only have a system seller on their hands, but a game that¡¦ll define an entire console generation¡Xa true classic that¡¦ll be talked about and fondly regarded for years to come."
2013,The Last of Us,"The Last of Us is visually arresting, mechanically solid, maturely written and by turns heart-rending, tense, unnerving and brutal. Check your ammo. Grab your shiv. Just try your best to stay alive."
2013,The Last of Us,"There's no denying it: The Last of Us hits almost every nail on the head. Its storytelling, its gameplay, its characters, and their journey in this bleak but almost sadly beautiful world that saw the downfall of the human civilization doesn't ever really try to shortcut its way to genuine emotions, opting, on the contrary, for the hard but humanely faithful path. The ambivalence of the human soul, the spot on portrayal of conflicting morals and the tragedy of impossible choices are all beautifully written and played. Plus, the multiplayer is far from being a gimmick; quite the contrary, in fact. It's very much a coherent and enticing experience on its own, with a brilliant meta-game idea, and a unique, multiplayer take on survival."
2013,The Last of Us,"The Last of Us is what we expected and more, much more. Naughty Dog delivers the game that made our jaws drop at E3: adult, honest and with an incredible attention to detail."
2013,The Last of Us,"A masterpiece, that breaks the self imposed barriers of gaming narrative and ensnares the player with intelligent gameplay and brilliant A.I. Anyone wanting to tackle the same themes will have to be compared to Naughty Dog's work in the future, and it won't be pretty."
2013,The Last of Us,"A masterpiece. Superb graphics, challenging gameplay, great story, believable characters and the eeriest clicking noise you've ever heard in a video game."
2013,The Last of Us,"Its storytelling is peerless, as affecting and multi-layered as it is grounded, underplayed and real. In terms of everything the modern action game has strived to be, The Last of Us is the full-stop at the end of the sentence, leaving no more to be said. Until next-gen. If this is our starting point for that, then the next five to ten years could be truly amazing."
2013,The Last of Us,"In an industry where big, epic, and huge are the normal, it is refreshing to see the importance of the little things. In fact, I believe this is The Last of Us¡¦ strongest suit. You will play this game and feel the overwhelming storyline, like the characters, and, after you have let it all soak in, some of your favorite moments will be the small things; the things you didn¡¦t have your hand held through."
2013,The Last of Us,"When such a talented developer hits these creative, narrative and technical heights, the result is a game that wouldn¡¦t look out of place smuggled into PS4¡¦s launch lineup. The acting is more believable than LA Noire¡¦s hi-tech gurning. There are sneaky set-piece excursions that outdo even Metal Gear Solid 4 at its best. And tying it all together is an utterly mesmerising world instilled with a seamless sense of time and place. This is a work of art in which amazing sights and sounds fuel an emotionally draining, constantly compelling end of days adventure."
2013,The Last of Us,"Ultimately, I defy anyone not to be moved when it comes to its conclusion and the huge questions it asks of both the player and the characters themselves ¡V any game that achieves such a goal deserves high-praise. The Last of Us succeeds in the same way as the best movies do, challenging you more than you'll ever expect, demanding that you think and discuss it weeks after it resolves. The fact I had the urge to pick it up again almost instantly is just added acclaim it has more than earned."
2013,The Last of Us,"Naughty Dog has delivered the most riveting, emotionally resonant story-driven epic of this console generation. At times it¡¦s easy to feel like big-budget development has too much on the line to allow stubbornly artful ideas to flourish, but then a game like The Last Of Us emerges through the crumbled blacktop like a climbing vine, green as a burnished emerald."
2013,The Last of Us,"The Last of Us is a deeply impressive demonstration of how it can and should be done. It starts out safe but ends brave; it has heart and grit, and it hangs together beautifully. And it's a real video game, too. An elegy for a dying world, The Last of Us is also a beacon of hope for its genre."
2013,The Last of Us,"Its unrivaled presentation in particular sets the bar even higher than the Uncharted trilogy already did, and its writing, voice acting and layered gameplay combine to create what is very easily the game to beat for Game of the Year 2013."
2013,The Last of Us,"It cannot be said enough, however, that Naughty Dog's new best creation is complete, and when I say complete, I mean it to pay the highest of compliments. I do not want more from The Last of Us: I do not need more. As the last line was uttered and the credits ushered in the close, I was done. The Last of Us had achieved everything it needed to achieve in order to provide me with everything I wanted...And it ended perfectly."
2013,The Last of Us,"The Last of Us is not simply Uncharted with zombies, but it couldn't exist without Naughty Dog having made Uncharted first, either. It's a dark adventure, one rarely filled with laughs or joy. There are bitter pills to swallow along the way, and nothing is taken for granted, not even characters. People live, people die. Sometimes it's fair, sometimes it's not. It's still a zombie game, but a sobering one. Take a deep breath."
2013,The Last of Us,"Overall, multiplayer is light on modes and it may not expand on the core story-driven experience, but it¡¦s still a thoughtful addition to a superbly executed package."
2013,The Last of Us,"It cannot be overstated that there is something exceptional at work here as masterful storytelling marries wonderfully with interactive experience, the high expectations that have built for this release are met and exceeded with consummate ease."
2013,The Last of Us,"With a hauntingly beautiful game world, stunning visuals, and a wide variety of ways in which players can approach combat, The Last of Us is another exceptional game from the team at Naughty Dog...However, it's the studio's ability to make this past-pandemic world and its contrasting cast of characters feel so believable and credible that really makes The Last of Us stand out from its peers."
2013,The Last of Us,"The Last of Us brings you into a world where people die without grace, and explains to you the beauty of the extinction. It's strong, unique, brutal and, ultimately, unforgettable."
2013,The Last of Us,"Terror and beauty are potent bedfellows in The Last of Us, a masterwork of interactive entertainment conjured up by the master gamesmiths at Naughty Dog."
2013,The Last of Us,"Despite a few issues, The Last of Us represents at the same time the complete maturity of the PlayStation 3 hardware and, above all, the perfect fusion between gameplay and narrative. Naughty Dog has created a masterpiece that will be a milestone in the video games evolution."
2013,The Last of Us,"I do not know if The Last of Us is the best game of this generation, given that it always depends on what you¡¦re looking for in a game, but it's a true example of how to create a credible world with authentic characters in which we end up investing a lot emotionally."
2013,The Last of Us,"I was transfixed by the game, truly loved playing it. It is definitely my game of the year, if not my game of the PS3. That said, there were some very, VERY minor things that irritated me."
2013,The Last of Us,"Something that plays well, makes you think, and keeps you playing to the end is, without a doubt, worth taking in."
2013,The Last of Us,"The comparisons to Uncharted can¡¦t be ignored and, while it might appear a ¡¥safe move¡¦ by Naughty Dog on the surface, their new franchise undoubtedly pushes the boundaries in a welcome new direction. They have put their well-polished engine to excellent use and put the emphasis on compelling characters to showcase what this talented studio can really deliver."
2013,The Last of Us,"The writing is great, the acting is superb, the characters are beautifully designed and developed, there¡¦s a riveting sense of authenticity, and the immersion one feels is unmatched."
2013,The Last of Us,"This is the most ambitious project Naughty Dog has made so far. It's not a new genre, but it mixes up some of them to bring something unique. It's got nothing to do with Uncharted apart from the look some images may show, but still is one of the best games on PlayStation 3."
2013,The Last of Us,Flawless in its ambition and almost perfect in its execution. A brave and remarkable game quite unlike any other.
2013,The Last of Us,"Plenty of action and horror, Naughty Dog's post-apocalyptic tale is an amazing game."
2013,The Last of Us,"The Last of Us is a really different game, mixing traditional adventure, survival, action, stealth and constant exploration. The resources are most important. The best graphics on PlayStation 3 are back in the hands of Naughty Dog, also the atmosphere, and two unrepeatable and unforgettable characters. Overwhelming."
2013,The Last of Us,"The Last of Us is a step forward for Naughty Dog in terms of narration, story and gameplay, maybe the last big shot for PlayStation 3 and a fine example of a ""cinematic game"" melted into a great gameplay. A must buy for every serious gamer."
2013,The Last of Us,"It is a deeply emotional story driven game with an addictive element making it difficult to put the controller down. It is game you won¡¦t forget and one that ultimately raises the bar for the genre. In the end it¡¦s simply a fantastic game, a fantastic experience, and one PS3 owners can purchase with confidence."
2013,The Last of Us,Three words: go get it.
2013,The Last of Us,"If you have a PlayStation 3 there is no reason why you shouldn't buy this game (unless you are not old enough of course). The story is incredible, the gameplay is fun, and the graphics and sound are amazing. Naughty Dog had a lot to live up to with the release, but they have delivered in spades. I just hope we don't have to wait too long for a sequel. This game is everything you were hoping for, and more. Go get it!"
2013,The Last of Us,"Thrilling survival horror with brutal combat, rich characters and stunning environments. [Aug 2013, p.57]"
2013,The Last of Us,"Much like the adventures of Drake, if you own a PS3, you need to own this game."
2013,The Last of Us,"The Last of Us is a testament to game design. Naughty Dog continues to perfect their craft at immersive storytelling, while still delivering one amazing game to play."
2013,The Last of Us,"The world is full of one trick AAA games, so any big title that manages to shake up the clear-cut genre barriers should be considered a welcome exception. For all intents and purposes, The Last of Us is a breakthrough title. It's enjoyable as a full-on shooter, a stealth game, an action adventure and a stat-building RPG. It's about as good as it gets for the current console generation. [June 2013]"
2013,The Last of Us,"As the credits rolled, I found myself missing my time with Joel and Ellie, yet completely comfortable with the thought that Naughty Dog has forged a new IP where there doesn¡¦t need to be The Last of Us 2."
2013,The Last of Us,"An absolutely stunning game that only minors and the squeamish should avoid, The Last of Us will rightly be remembered as one of this generation's very best games."
2013,The Last of Us,"The Last of Us offers a bitter and horrifying look at humanity after a ¡¥zombie apocalypse¡¦. It's an emotional journey that¡¦ll touch you, without a doubt. But it doesn¡¦t only have a strong story: the constant tension, great gameplay scenario¡¦s and atmosphere make for a brilliant combination of elements that I can easily recommend to any gamer."
2013,The Last of Us,"With The Last of Us developer Naughty Dog switches from the easy entertainment that is Uncharted, to the more serious stuff. Despite their differences, both games prove to be of unprecedented high levels of quality, from a studio that controls their ability to create games into the smallest detail. Thanks to its unique pace and adult story The Last of Us has become an experience that has no equal."
2013,The Last of Us,"The Last of Us spells the magnum opus for Naughty Dog on the PlayStation 3, offering us a unique experience that easily eclipses anything else we¡¦ve seen on the system. This game is easily a contender for adventure game of the year."
2013,The Last of Us,"Hopefully not the last great game of this generation, but definitely one of the best of them. Nobody should miss out on this jaw-dropping masterpiece of epic proportions."
2013,The Last of Us,"Naughty Dog puts an end to the current generation with a game that explores the human interaction of two characters, Joel and Ellie, that are destined to get along in a shattered world that has been wonderfully represented thanks to its impressive technical aspects. The Last of Us, in spite of its small imperfections, is an adult title that no PS3 player should let go unplayed."
2013,The Last of Us,"With The Last of Us, Naughty Dog provides us with a hell of a masterpiece, which will continue to occupy the thoughts of gamers in the coming years, simply because it redefines the standards of survival Horror games. Instead of using and abusing horrific scenes as is the case with the competitors, the game provides a chronic stress that chews on your brains bit by bit punctuated by great epic scenes. The infected people are relentless and unforgiving, though a bit like the Clickers who will rip your head at the slightest sound. The listening system does not impact the challenge and finds itself an invaluable asset when things get really dirty. As one needs to seduce casual gamers, The Last of Us also has its own action scenes, hence the criticism from the purists of this kind of game. But can we really be skeptical when facing the nicest game of this generation of consoles ? No, we cant..."
2013,The Last of Us,"It¡¦s easy to initially expect The Last of Us to be a game about killing zombies, surviving in a post-apocalyptic world, and exploring for supplies. Instead, it¡¦s a game about two people, and the bond that forms between them¡Xand that journey is far more exciting than any amount of infected monsters or food scavenging could ever provide."
2013,The Last of Us,"The Last of Us is a deeply felt, shockingly violent game that questions what we're willing to sacrifice and, more disturbingly, what we're willing to do so save the ones we love. The conclusion offers no easy answers. You won't forget it."
2013,The Last of Us,"A thrilling, cinematic, movie-like action-adventure with the best videogame pairing ever conceived."
2013,The Last of Us,"It will live with us. Here, finally, is a videogame that will live with us. There are inconsistencies here and there, some lulls in its gameplay, but when The Last Of Us is good (winter), it's better than anything else this gen - we do not say that lightly. [Issue#232, p.62]"
2013,The Last of Us,"The Last of Us is a must-play title for any PS3 owner who's not squeamish about violence and depressing subject matter. It has flaws, but they don't detract from the overall experience, and at worst, the game could use a little more interaction."
2013,The Last of Us,Quotation forthcoming.
2013,The Last of Us,"Despite the breakneck pace of the prologue, it takes quite a while for The Last of Us to pick up some speed again. However, once the cold harsh winter arrives, the action (and story) ramps up. So much so, it puts most Hollywood productions to shame. [July 2013, p.76]"
2013,The Last of Us,The Last of Us merges very good gameplay with a peerless story and unequaled production values. While it just misses transcendent status you won't find very many games that are more worth the investment of your time.
2013,The Last of Us,"As someone who was never a great fan of Uncharted or Jak and Daxter, I am genuinely amazed at how much I liked this game. If this isn't art, then I don't know what is. [Aug 2013, p.59]"
2013,The Last of Us,"With a well-thought-out mythos, a mildly original take on the zombie survival game that relies more on superb execution and storytelling than innovative mechanics, acting that's so good we actually see character development happen without even words being spoken, and Naughty Dog's impressive engine and top-notch production values, it all comes together to make for a wonderful reminder that not all big-budget action games need to be measured in headshots-per-minute."
2013,The Last of Us,"Like the fungus that infected its deformed inhabitants, The Last of Us is not an enjoyable thing to experience. It¡¦s depressing, exhausting and even disturbing. But , contrary to everything I tell myself, it¡¦s something I won¡¦t soon forget."
2013,The Last of Us,"It feels like an important evolutionary step in presentation and tone, presenting a believable narrative populated with realistic characters, structured in a way that remains captivating until the last word is spoken. Multiplayer is disposable and combat can feel a bit rudimentary at times complete with balance issues, but being perpetually enveloped in the stunning world Naughty Dog created makes it easy to forget any flaws."
2013,The Last of Us,"The Last of Us is an excellent action adventure game with superb graphics and audio and really great characters. The game shows us a quite realistic vision of a cataclysmic future, and at the same time is a very good shooter mixed with high quality stealth game. The Last of Us is a linear adventure, but this is a good kind of ""corridor"" story that offers some freedom and doesn't limit your imagination. What is more, it's one of the most mature games in history."
2013,The Last of Us,"In the developer of The Last of Us, Naughty Dog, we find the king of action-adventurers more and more. Its last game brings us storytelling that is as endearing and emotional as it gets. A definite must-play for every gamer worldwide."
2013,The Last of Us,"The characters in The Last of Us are relatable without being entirely stereotypical, the story is driven by the characters, rather than the reverse, and the adventure sections, while nothing new mechanically, offer a great way to really delve into the world. Given the lack of truly innovative mechanics, and the reliance on well-known types of gameplay, like the all-too-typical ""find a ladder to climb to the next section"" adventuring bits, The Last of Us isn't perfect, but it's awfully close."
2013,The Last of Us,"A stunning achievement in both storytelling and third person adventure, with unforgettable characters and tense, brilliantly paced action."
2013,The Last of Us,"Naughty Dog managed to create a different kind of action game, one with a more dramatic, desperate and authentic tone than Uncharted. Joel and Ellie offer you a journey you won't forget, just bring lots of bullets and keep your head down."
2013,The Last of Us,"The Last of Us has perhaps the best artificial intelligence I¡¦ve ever seen in a game. The enemies, whether they are mindless zombies or clever human ""hunters,"" behave in amazingly realistic ways, forcing the player to think up equally smart strategies in each encounter."
2013,The Last of Us,"It¡¦s the relationships that really make The Last Of Us. It¡¦s a technical marvel, a true triple-A with best-in-show production values, but it¡¦s the beautiful combination of performance and story that elevates it clearly above the competition."
2013,The Last of Us,"The pacing becomes somewhat sluggish right before you hit the final act, but from there it moves at a 100 miles an hour. I didn¡¦t leave my couch until well after the credits rolled."
2013,The Last of Us,"Naughty Dog has created a exciting and emotional adventure, packed with a great cast of characters, impressive voice acting and beautiful visuals. A varied selection of enemies offers a diverse challenge, and you often have to change strategies to get by without using up your resources. The multiplayer is functional and well done, but is eclipsed by the amazing single player adventure."
2013,The Last of Us,"The Last of Us is a stable and very decent action game, wrapped in an absolutely incredible presentation and story. When it comes to the narrative, The Last of Us sets a new golden standard that every game will be compared to for years to comes. It honestly feels as if Naughty Dog has raised the bar of what games as a medium are able to achieve in this area, and makes franchises like Call of Duty and all its wannabes seem decidedly laughable."
2013,The Last of Us,"The Last of Us delights with its artistic side but can tire you with its gameplay. It tells an interesting story but doesn¡¦t leave much room for the player. It represents a new quality in the industry but openly borrows a lot of themes from literature, movies and other games. The most important thing however is the fact that several days after I finished The Last of Us, it is still in my head, causing strange uneasiness. I guess that¡¦s what the developers were aiming for. [CD-Action 08/2013, p.62]"
2013,The Last of Us,"A brilliant and evocative story, superb combat mechanics and an interesting multiplayer component, The Last Of Us is one of this generation's best."
2013,The Last of Us,"The Last of Us is a great action-adventure game that manages tocapture the feeling of post-apocalypse and survival. The story isalright but way too manipulative and borrows heavily from other,better, material. Still the segmented survival gameplay and theamazing audiovisual production makes the game an experience everybodyshould check out."
2013,The Last of Us,"I'd say that the kind of story that The Last of Us wants to tell can't be done in a mainstream video game, but I Am Alive and the Metro series manage just fine. Perhaps it's more accurate to say that it can't be done in the kind of game that's expected to sell three million copies."
2013,The Last of Us,"Despite its major victories and steps forward in storytelling, many of those same annoying video game conventions ¡X the demand for action and high body counts, the lack of truly engaging and innovative play mechanics ¡X continue to pull games like The Last of Us down toward the lowest common denominator."
2013,The Last of Us,"Despite the many small problems in combat, there's an undeniable tension. Vanquishing a horde of attackers is challenging, so you must fight intelligently."
2013,The Last of Us,"Despite the occasional jarring juxtaposition between its story and its gameplay, The Last of Us is a landmark piece of interactive entertainment, proving that even action games can tell mature, thoughtful tales, with characters who don¡¦t feel like an assortment of tropes and clich_s."
2013,The Last of Us,"The amazing art direction and style are on double duty in The Last of Us, because the game¡¦s designers did not think its universe through. Yes, monsters are not the focal point of this story, but only three types is too few for a campaign spanning 12 to 15 hours. There are also human bandits, but a few encounters ¡V and you¡¦ve seen them all."
2013,The Last of Us,"Naughty Dog commits to a somber tone that affects every piece of the game for better and worse. It achieves incredible emotional high points about as often as it bumps up against tired scenario design that doesn't fit its world. Survival in the post-apocalypse requires compromise, but The Last of Us has given up something vital."
2013,The Last of Us,"There is no risk of failure in a game like this. There is only the risk of having the play the same section yet again. In a survival game, that¡¦s anathema. A survival game without meaningful death isn¡¦t a survival game. It¡¦s just a game."
2013,Tomb Raider,"Early quick-time events aside, this twelve hour adventure suffers so few missteps that it¡¦s a genuine delight to play, even as the lead gets trampled into the seasoned pro we¡¦ve come to know. Everyone take a bowÿ the first lady of gaming has returned."
2013,Tomb Raider,Tomb Raider is a brilliant game on the XBox 360 and the developers have successfully rebooted the franchise for the 21st century with next-generation graphics and gameplay.
2013,Tomb Raider,"With a well written cast of characters, mightily impressive production techniques, sumptuous visuals, tight platforming and surprisingly enjoyable combat, Tomb Raider is most definitely a release to be treasured."
2013,Tomb Raider,"This is the Tomb Raider you've wanted for years. It needs a few more puzzles, but that's a small gripe when cast against such a marvelous adventure."
2013,Tomb Raider,"Tomb Raider earns its score for daring to go big and then executing on that goal with considerable aplomb in every important area. It looks great, plays well, and is fun from beginning to end. Even more than that, it does all of those things with more skill and finesse than almost any other game before it."
2013,Tomb Raider,"This reboot is gritty and brutal, casting Lara in a new, grittier light and you will see Lara in a different perspective than we originally know her by. Tomb Raider feels similar to the Uncharted series, and has really made a welcome return to consoles."
2013,Tomb Raider,"Tomb Raider is the second best Uncharted game behind Uncharted 2. While it gives up a lot of its adventure identity fans have come to know and love, the end result is still a fantastic game that shouldn¡¦t be missed by any action fan. If Crystal Dynamics can inject more adventure elements into a potential sequel, it would be a pretty interesting proposition indeed."
2013,Tomb Raider,"From a story perspective, Lara is now as interesting a character as (though wholly different from) sardonic Nathan Drake. This feels like Uncharted will have to start chasing Tomb Raider."
2013,Tomb Raider,"Tomb Raider is an extraordinary video-game. Its gameplay is amusing, Lara's animations are stunning, and the game is one hell of a ride."
2013,Tomb Raider,Tomb Raider is an action-packed adventure game that offers a new origin story for Lara and that mixes an epic plot and an incredibly detailed setting which let us enjoy the very beginning of her journey towards her legendary status.
2013,Tomb Raider,"The Lara we know from long ago has grown up. Is that a bad thing? No,she is replaced by a new, maybe even better Lara, who will appeal to afuture generation of gamers. If this game is a hint to what the futureof Tomb Raider might be, than we are very much looking forward to thenext game in the series."
2013,Tomb Raider,"This new installment of the series is probably the best in years. Tomb Raider reunites classical elements with the new adventure game philosophy, resulting in a true Masterpiece."
2013,Tomb Raider,The lackluster multiplayer is absolutely no reason to avoid what is otherwise one of the best action adventures I¡¦ve ever played.
2013,Tomb Raider,"Lara¡¦s latest adventure is one of the most fun, immersive, emotional, and thrilling rides the series has ever taken us on."
2013,Tomb Raider,"Lara Croft's comeback is simply stunning. The cinematic gameplay, its atmosphere and the ""LOST resembling"" environments are great, while the multiplayer is a nice-to-have goodie. The game is let down just a little by its German localization and Lara's redundant squad members. Nevertheless, in my opinion it's the best game in 2013 so far."
2013,Tomb Raider,"Tomb Raider is well-written, sympathetic, exciting, beautiful and just incredibly well-made."
2013,Tomb Raider,"A near flawless example of how to reboot a franchise. Gripping, satisfying and strangely dark, we struggle to see how this origin story could have been told much better. [May 2013, p.77]"
2013,Tomb Raider,"Lara doesn't disappoint, while Yamatai proves one of the most memorable playgrounds in gaming. [Apr 2013, p.59]"
2013,Tomb Raider,"This is a game that starts on a high note and ends on a high note, and propels Lara with a brisk pace in between, without falling into monotony. It¡¦s an exceptional new start for the Tomb Raider franchise."
2013,Tomb Raider,"Tomb Raider¡¦s whole is greater than the sum of its parts, and everything combines to make this the best reboot game on the market today."
2013,Tomb Raider,"A breathtaking reboot of Lara Croft's adventures, the new Tomb Raider puts aside some of its legacy in favor of a more modern feel and gameplay. Old school fans may find this a bit unsettling, but no matter what type of gamer you are, Tomb Rider is one hell of a ride."
2013,Tomb Raider,"It surely isn't easy to produce a game as fun, balanced and polished as Tomb Raider, but Crystal Dynamics managed to do so."
2013,Tomb Raider,"After nearly two decades, Crystal Dynamics finally gets it right. Tomb Raider is an action-packed thrill ride full of amazing set-pieces, sharp writing, a fun science fiction story and tons of enemies to gun down. Tomb Raider is a game worthy of the Croft name!"
2013,Tomb Raider,"Tomb Raider is not just a reboot, but a revelation in a series that had long passed its prime."
2013,Tomb Raider,"Crystal Dynamics and Square Enix had an undeniably heavy burden in modernizing a character born from an immature, male-oriented fantasy, but no matter your gender, if you're a gamer, you should play Tomb Raider. It combines high-levels of interactivity, excellent pacing, and a true bond between the player and the character on screen."
2013,Tomb Raider,"Crystal Dynamics has exceeded my expectations and crafted one of the most intense, rewarding, surprising and bloody origin stories I¡¦ve had the pleasure of playing through. It¡¦s been a long time since I HAD to finish a game."
2013,Tomb Raider,"Shootings, platforming, puzzles, exploration and a great visual experience rewrite the story ¡V and history ¡V of Tomb Raider. This is a beautiful adventure that everyone will enjoy, except those expecting a classic Tomb Raider game."
2013,Tomb Raider,"This is the reboot we were waiting for. Beautiful, clever, expertly paced, it's a superb blend of action, exploration and puzzle."
2013,Tomb Raider,"Tomb Raider reaffirms the importance and value of having strong, realistic female protagonists in games, while also successfully transposing much of what people loved about the original titles into an adventure that feels superbly modern. It¡¦s a better Uncharted game than Uncharted 3 was."
2013,Tomb Raider,"Its expert sense of pacing, captivating setting, and dark tone create a truly memorable experience that's further enhanced by an immense level of detail. Lara croft, the old Lara Croft, is dead. In place of a dolled-up gunslinger is a do-what-it-takes survivor--and we hope she hasn't had her fill of adventuring just yet."
2013,Tomb Raider,"It's easy to point out the many ways that Tomb Raider borrows bits and pieces from other popular games of the last five years, but Crystal Dynamics has blended these disparate strengths into something remarkable. It's cinematic yet open, intense yet laid-back, fresh yet polished."
2013,Tomb Raider,"The reinvention of the franchise succeeds in almost every aspect of the game, so much so that it actually tops the Uncharted series among the great adventure games for this console generation. I hope to see you again soon, Lara."
2013,Tomb Raider,"Tomb Raider is a wonderful adventure which reaches the heights of Uncharted. Lara Croft returns in an exciting and relatively open game, with all genres very well-realized. Temples, tombs and archeology with intense action, puzzles and jumps. Just what we wanted."
2013,Tomb Raider,"A number of minor gaffes, an uninspired multiplayer, and a severe drop in tension defuse Tomb Raider somewhat, but nothing stops it from living up to Lara¡¦s legacy."
2013,Tomb Raider,"Delivers an evenly paced, action-packed, evolutionary tale that explains the genesis of one of gaming¡¦s most beloved heroines. Along the way, we are treated to top-shelf visuals, a soundscape that rivals a Hollywood blockbuster, and gameplay that is both thoroughly engaging and aesthetically varied."
2013,Tomb Raider,"Tomb Raider's reboot is definitely a success delivering a deep, adrenalinic and spectacular game with a new and charismatic Lara Croft. Our main complaint is with the lack of greater scale puzzles and more challenging ones, something the game should have retained from its predecessors."
2013,Tomb Raider,"This game is Tomb Raider through and through, while not being the Tomb Raider you grew up with. The franchise that defined a genre has stopped being schooled and moved from the back seat to the fore."
2013,Tomb Raider,"The new Tomb Raider is not as revolutionary as the original from 1996 but this reboot is the most mature, interesting and friendly entry to the series. For me it is Uncharted on steroids, a game that¡¦s better in every aspect than Nathan Drake¡¦s adventures. [CD-Action 04/2013, p.52]"
2013,Tomb Raider,"Flawed as its presentation of the young Lara story may be, Tomb Raider is a great game first and an interesting story second. The latter certainly stumbles frequently throughout, but I was never put-off enough to actually stop playing - chiefly because the gameplay I was indulging in was so persuasively fun. That¡¦s what matters in the end."
2013,Tomb Raider,"Tomb Raider tells a great story combined with enjoyable gameplay, though the latter slightly diminishes the impact of the former."
2013,Tomb Raider,"The new Tomb Raider might be the best one since the original, because it lets go of the classic formula. The reboot gives us a young Lara Croft who ended up in a thriller in a jungle and responds to that like a human made out of flesh and blood. Unfortunately this direction was dropped in the second act, after which they thankfully restore themselves and make good on an adventure that you will not want to end."
2013,Tomb Raider,Quotation forthcoming.
2013,Tomb Raider,"Lara Croft emerges from this game a darker, more troubled protagonist. But that¡¦s okay ¡V just like James Bond and Batman, she¡¦s better off for it. Gamers are too, since this is certainly the best Tomb Raider game on this generation of consoles."
2013,Tomb Raider,"Lara's return is a triumphant one, providing gamers with a visually breathtaking adventure around a well-realised island setting that harbours some dark secrets. Some more challenging puzzles and platforming would have been welcome, but as it stands, Tomb Raider is a thrilling reboot of a legendary franchise."
2013,Tomb Raider,"Miss Croft's return is a finely crafted action-adventure title, with solid game design choices and some spectacular moments. The action-packed gameplay can't really support the forcefully crude and violent narrative of the campaign though, and the lack of originality and challenge lessens the experience in the end. It's definitely a great game, but with some ballsy moves it could have been an amazing one."
2013,Tomb Raider,"The single-player campaign here is the main attraction, and it is excellent. It doesn't try to rewrite the book on third-person action adventure games. But with its excellent controls, engaging heroine, thrilling combat, and fascinating setting, it doesn't need to."
2013,Tomb Raider,"A few things about the new Tomb Raider come across as wasted effort. The story of Lara¡¦s transformation is sabotaged by the gameplay, and is frankly a little dorky, with an after-school special style multi-ethnic cast filled by lame sterotypes like angry black woman and scrap-happy Scotsman. Likewise a multiplayer mode, which nobody familiar with Tomb Raider would expect or even think to ask for, is competent but utterly unremarkable."
2013,Tomb Raider,"It¡¦s all deftly anchored by a perceptive, nuanced narrative that helps fashion Croft into a convincing heroine who can weather extraordinary circumstances, while remaining convincingly human throughout. These quieter moments make what¡¦s already a stunning ride even more worthwhile."
2013,Tomb Raider,"Tightly produced, competent in both its puzzling and its combat, this is one reboot that manages to be unequivocally superior to its predecessors."
2013,Tomb Raider,"Tomb Raider is a solid action adventure that offers a thrilling ride, but adds very little new to the genre and sadly falls short of the idea of open-ended survival adventure it was first marketed as. [March 2013]"
2013,Tomb Raider,"Despite the interesting and open level design, Tomb Raider is more akin to the average action adventure than you would think. An overall linear experience, with plenty of cinematic sequences and over the top roller-coaster rides that falls somehow short of expectations when it comes to the survival matter."
2013,Tomb Raider,"It¡¦s a fine return to form for the heroine whose comically conical boobs once fuelled a thousand adolescent quests for mythical nude codes. Lara Croft¡¦s a real girl now, with real motivations, fears and feelings. And this is one reboot we hope will stick."
2013,Tomb Raider,"The combat is the best it's ever been, puzzles are short but satisfying, and Yamatai is a veritable platforming playground. For the series fanatic, there are loads of secrets to find and a new legend to digest. More importantly, it just may convince a new generation to like Tomb Raider again."
2013,Tomb Raider,"There¡¦s an awful lot to like about Tomb Raider. It takes the gameplay Uncharted has used to such great effect (which was, of course, nicked from Tomb Raider in the first place), and replaces wise-cracking gentleman-thief Nathan Drake with this new damaged Lara Croft, one of the most involving characters seen in a computer game to date."
2013,Tomb Raider,"It is extremely impressive, on both technical and artistic levels. With that degree of sheen does come a lack of edge, of course, and Tomb Raider is not a brave game. Nor is it one that¡¦ll likely live long in the memory, but while you¡¦re walking in Lara¡¦s muddy size fours, it is spellbinding."
2013,Tomb Raider,"Lara's exquisite animation allows her to move through the world with unmatched grace, and the heavy emphasis on combat is more palatable thanks to its ease of interaction, Lara naturally crouching behind cover and switching between her bow, pistol, rifle and shotgun with rare quickness and ease."
2013,Tomb Raider,"Tomb Raider might be guilty of trying to do too many things at once, but the relative quality of each one of those individual things is high enough that the whole is still pretty satisfying."
2013,Tomb Raider,"A great cinematic action adventure, with one of gaming¡¦s great lead performances, although its Tomb Raider DNA seems fragmented and even degenerative in parts."
2013,Tomb Raider,"Crystal Dynamics built a gorgeous game, with a lot of good ideas and an astonishing artistic direction. Unfortunately, the game script is poor, and the lack of strong characters and design innovations make the latter part of Tomb Raider a spectacular third person shooter, but one without personality."
2013,Tomb Raider,"An excellent game that, while paying tribute to Lara Croft's heritage, certainly feels like a new beginning - mechanically as well as thematically. It's visually dazzling, narratively affecting, dangerously near best-in-class when it comes to solid shooting, vertiginous platforming and ballsy set plays... and bodes fantastically for any future instalments."
2013,Tomb Raider,"When taken for what it is¡Xand not what it could have been¡Xwe¡¦ve been given a game that serves as a fantastic first step, but which also is clearly only a first step in what will be an arduous journey."
2013,Tomb Raider,"Whether she¡¦s huddled up against the cold or sending five men to their doom with an explosive arrow, this is still Lara Croft, one of gaming¡¦s most distinctive heroes ¡V and now she has a personality that extends far beyond the bounds of her bra straps. If the purpose of a reboot is to redefine a character and set them up for the future, then this is a job well done."
2013,Tomb Raider,"Beneath the noise there is an engaging story clamouring to be heard, and there are moments of true beauty, serenity and pathos fighting for attention. The game does get better as it goes on, and despite the distractions the last few hours are a pleasure to play. At the centre of it all is a brilliant character, still iconic but more human and believable than she's ever been before."
2013,Tomb Raider,"Our main beef is that the developers have spent an excessive amount of time polishing and perfecting those cinematics and QTEs, instead of developing more engaging puzzles and even the occasional riddle wouldn¡¦t have gone amiss."
2013,Tomb Raider,"There is a platform here for Crystal Dynamics to take Lara¡¦s shenanigans to a new level, but a reliance on fairly bog standard shooter mechanics just doesn¡¦t do the franchise any justice and as a result, means Tomb Raider falls short of being a truly great game."
2013,Tomb Raider,"A good comeback of the most popular gaming heroine ever. Tomb Raider is a pleasing and relaxing thing that is not going to bore you. However, this is not a game you are going to remember in a few months as a something special."
2013,Tomb Raider,"While it can be nice to be held by the hand, Crystal Dynamics' grip could have been a lot looser."
2013,Tomb Raider,"All in all, this Tomb Raider reboot isn¡¦t perfect. But it is a step in the right direction for the series, and again marks the most fun I¡¦ve had with a Tomb Raider title in a while. It¡¦s got enough of that AAA polish to make it a contender, but I feel that the series is going to need some fresh ideas if it really wants to compete with the big hitters."
2013,Tomb Raider,"Tomb Raider is a fine game, but something essential feels like it has been left out. Lara seems to have found the map, but missed the treasure."
2013,Tomb Raider,It¡¦s really hard to be excited about the future of Tomb Raider after this game. It fails where more successful films and games of its kind succeed: in its characters. The way in which Lara goes from inexperienced to full-on action movie hero survivalist is so jarring that it¡¦s near impossible as a player to remain on the same emotional wavelength as the story. Because of this the rest of the game falters.
