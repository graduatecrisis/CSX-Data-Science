Year,Game,Review
2010,Call of Duty: Black Ops,"Treyarch's game is exhilarating and beautifully orchestrated, but it feels like a full-stop, it needs to be a full-stop, because toward the end of the campaign, bombardment fatigue begins to set in."
2010,Call of Duty: Black Ops,"There are few video games released this year that you simply cannot miss, Call of Duty: Black Ops is one of them."
2010,Call of Duty: Black Ops,"Congrats Treyarch, you passed the test. Black Ops still has some technical flaws (some erratic scripts), but it doesn't lack ambition, variety, nor freshness. Its solo campaign boasts a good scenario, and its multiplayer is as comprehensive and solid as ever, while changing some basic systems for the better and introducing soon-to-be-cult new modes, as well as community features one could only find in the latest Halo iterations before. There may be ways to improve it yet again, but the 2010 CoD delivers on its promise - we can't say anymore that Treyarch's Call of Dutys don't measure up."
2010,Call of Duty: Black Ops,"I admit I had my doubts about Black Ops. It seemed that Modern Warfare 2 was going to be impossible to top, but Treyarch has come in and trounced that game in every possible way."
2010,Call of Duty: Black Ops,"The good news is that the game is absolutely worth the investment, and even if you find yourself disagreeing with some of the changes Treyarch instituted or you run into a bunch of morons who are hell bent on ruining a particular mode for you, you have plenty of other options to keep you engaged for a good long time."

With everything that this game has to offer, both on and offline, it will be a resident of console drives for a long time to come."

2010,Call of Duty: Black Ops,"Treyarch finally comes out of Infinity Ward's shadow, producing the best CoD to date. An epic and intense game, with a very good story and and many ways to enjoy it other than the single player campaign."
2010,Call of Duty: Black Ops,"Conclusion is Treyarch had very large shoes to fill, and let me tell you they passed with flying colors, erasing any doubt that I ever had about them making the next Call of Duty titles for years to come."
2010,Call of Duty: Black Ops,"Maybe gamers doubted if this Black Ops was going to be on par with the games made by Infinity War, but it even surpasses them in some aspects."

2010,Call of Duty: Black Ops,"The total amount of worthwhile content makes paying full price for most other games feel like a crime. Treyarch has closed the gap between its games and the Modern Warfare franchise with boundless customization, a keen sense of what makes the formula a success, and listening to fans. You won't regret answering the call once again."
2010,Call of Duty: Black Ops,Black Ops is simply a terrific game and a solid addition to the Call of Duty franchise.
2010,Call of Duty: Black Ops,"Black Ops is one of the best first person shooters this year, and is a obviously must have for any action fan. Intense, gory and quite brilliant, maybe it's not refreshing but at the same time its a stunning game."

2010,Call of Duty: Black Ops,"There are more highlights in the first two missions of Black Ops, then in Medal of Honor. The requirements of Treyarch seemed to be better, than in the past few years. They made an interesting setting. In addition, there's a nice zombie mode and an overwhelming multiplayer. No doubt, this is Treyarchs best Call of Duty ever!"
2010,Call of Duty: Black Ops,"All in all, you simply cannot find a better package out right now."
2010,Call of Duty: Black Ops,"Thanks to an intense storytelling, a thrilling plot, and a redefined multiplayer, Black Ops is the best Call of Duty developed by TreyArch studio, and one of the most interesting chapter ever. Year after year, this great series keeps on arousing a huge amount of videoplayers."

The new modes can provide a lot of fun and if you liked the previous CoD for the online, Black Ops will be your next divinity to adore."

2010,Call of Duty: Black Ops,"Black Ops is quite a pleasant surprise: On the one hand former second class developer Treyarch reaches the Infinity Ward's standard of gameplay quality and inventiveness for the first time. On the other hand Treyarch manages to set a course of their own through the unusual story and a ton of tributes to other masterpieces of action, be it movie or game. Plus Activision conceded the time and resources to Treyarch to aspire a really great game. And that's something you'll notice immediately. You'll recognize the passion and the effort that went into making this new episode. Black Ops delivers Call of Duty gaming at its best as well as a distinctly individual approach to the whole scenario.

2010,Call of Duty: Black Ops,"Treyarch archieves with Black Ops the best single player campaign in a recent Call of Duty; spectacular, memorable, well driven and with a very solid script, and wraps it with some other extras that denote special care to the solo-player. The multiplayer shines as usual, adding few new modes that blend in very well in a mode that will make the game last exciting moths. On the other hand, AI flaws, respawn patterns and the engine performance are COD's endemic sickness that need to be seriously reconsidered in the short therm or they could pull the franchise down."
2010,Call of Duty: Black Ops,"We can only hope that the team at Infinity Ward has the humility to learn from and implement the features Treyarch has introduced here when it comes to the next Call Of Duty, particularly with regards to multiplayer. [Christmas 2010, p.84]"
2010,Call of Duty: Black Ops,"There's little to complain about here. The singleplayer, multiplayer and zombie-mode ensure you won't be able to put down your controller for a long time to come. Black Ops isn't just a great game, it's a great Call of Duty. A bigger compliment can't be given to Treyarch."
2010,Call of Duty: Black Ops,"With solid single player and multiplayer components, Call of Duty: Black Ops is easily the best game that Treyarch has ever produced."

2010,Call of Duty: Black Ops,What we have here is a refined and extremely confident product from a studio that has found its feet in the FPS world.
2010,Call of Duty: Black Ops,"With the hype and excitement surrounding Treyarch's first Call of Duty where they aren't bound by a World War II setting, it's a shame that they went for more of the same MW2. This isn't say it's poor but personally I feel they've missed an opportunity to really stamp their authority with Black Ops. Still, as a complete package with a great story, strong FPS action and a killer multiplayer mode, Black Ops remains unmissable."
2010,Call of Duty: Black Ops,"Call of Duty: Black Ops bears the series' standard superbly, delivering an engrossing campaign and exciting competitive multiplayer."
2010,Call of Duty: Black Ops,"Although it's certainly got Infinity Ward's fingerprints all over it, Black Ops is definitely Treyarch's baby.

2010,Call of Duty: Black Ops,"""Quotation Forthcoming"""
2010,Call of Duty: Black Ops,"Treyarch have done a fine job with Black Ops. Not only does the game retain its Call of Duty aesthetic appeal, and pushes all of the series strengths seemingly as far as they can go, but now other aspects of the game are also to this high standard."

2010,Call of Duty: Black Ops,"If you're new to the Call of Duty series, you're in for a real treat with the single player, and the multiplayer will welcome you with open arms. If you used to like the series and have either gotten fatigued with the template or turned off by the last entry, this game deserves at least a rental, but I'd recommend a purchase. If you simply love the franchise, period, you've probably already prestiged once or twice already devoting countless hours to the online portions."
2010,Call of Duty: Black Ops,"The weak and twitchy single-player - with many of the same old flaws - almost undermines all of the superb extra features and pretty much flawless multiplayer offering. Veterans and regular players still have the advantage over newcomers, but with Combat Training and the Zombie mode, there is plenty of fun to be had for even the most inexperienced players.

2010,Call of Duty: Black Ops,"Single-player is as exhaustingly fast-paced as ever with large set pieces that try to take the attention off of the lackluster AI of both friends and enemies. That withstanding, the story is the best I've ever seen from a Call of Duty game."
2010,Call of Duty: Black Ops,Call of Duty: Black Ops is not the most original game on the market but what it offers is a fun package filled to the brim with content.

2010,Call of Duty: Black Ops,"But compared to the last couple Call of Duty games, Black Ops doesn't really do anything to set it apart. It is still a great game that shooter fans will love without question ¡V just don't expect it to change your perspective on the long-running series."

2010,Call of Duty: Black Ops,"Do you want to play more Call of Duty? I'm guessing the answer is yes, and by all means, Black Ops is worth playing. But for all its ambitious steps to set itself apart from the previous games, it flounders in a few too many of those areas to be a total success."

2010,Call of Duty: Black Ops,"Ultimately, there is little doubt that Black Ops will sate the hunger of those simply wanting more Call of Duty, but beyond that it seem unlikely that it will broaden the palettes of gamers or indeed the genre; and for such a big budget, high profile release, we can't help but feel a little disappointed with that."

2010,Call of Duty: Black Ops,"Call of Duty: Black Ops has a solid and fun multiplayer, and the best story in a Call of Duty-game yet. Despite this, it has got issues with arbitrary and unnecessary design. It isn_t as tight as its predecessor, and unless you are either not a fan of singleplayer story, og just plain tired of the multiplayer in Modern Warfare 2, the latter is still the better game."
2010,Call of Duty: Black Ops,"It feels more like a yearly update than a sequel, a new campaign with old multiplayer. The game isn't distinct from its predecessors in any important way, and fatigue sets in quicker than before. [Jan 2011, p.94]"

2010,God of War3,"Kratos is given a wonderfully epic farewell that would truly be a shame to miss, and every aspect of the game, from the controls, to the combat, to the presentation, is as close to perfect as perfect can be.

2010,God of War3,"If you want revolutionary gameplay then you should stay as far away from this game as possible. But if you're looking for the same experience as the previous games intensified to a whole new level then you're in luck, because that is exactly what GoW 3 does."
2010,God of War3,"It retains the series' hallmark action but literally turns things on its head by dropping in dynamic landscapes that twist and turn as you fight. [May 2010, p.70]"
2010,God of War3,"Even if God of War III isn't going to cause a massive rethink on the way you play action-heavy platformers, Kratos has earned an enviable position at the head of his genre's ladder - and we don't think there's going to be another hero quite like him, in a series as consistently outstanding as this, for a very long time."
2010,God of War3,"For all God of War III's familiarity, it's a game refined with such grace and skill, there's no question that this is the absolute pinnacle of an already exhilarating series. Sure, it's a smaller, leaner beast than its predecessors but, as it happens, one that packs an absolutely unforgettable punch."
2010,God of War3,"God of War 3 does not represent a revolution in the genre. But it is massive, and brutal, and thrilling, like no other action game in this generation."
2010,God of War3,Some of the most engrossing combat and visceral action the PS3 has to offer - presented expertly.
2010,God of War3,"God of War 3 is fantastic, and has at least three scenes that are utterly magnificent. Design and gameplay-wise, it's absolutely stunning. The downside is that it doesn't have that clear cut perfection that its predecessor had; the polish shine that brilliantly lit up our eyes when we first enjoyed God of War 2."
2010,God of War3,"God of War III is the comeback of the most bad ass hero in the history of videogames. Brutal, mega-polished and astonishingly beautiful: Sony Santa Monica has crafted a conclusion to the God of War trilogy that is really worth the wait."
2010,God of War3,God of War is back and better than ever before! It's a worthy end of a trilogy. A tear for the last fight from our favourite Spartan. Let there be more Kratos in the future!
2010,God of War3,"God of War III is an exhilarating tale, and one which showcases just what a good development team can do with some predictable mechanics. Most of the other games that exist in the genre have been blasted if not into obscurity, then certainly into irrelevance. Although God of War III remains unapologetically a hack 'n' slash title, just about everything has been improved, tweaked, expanded, polished, and refined."
2010,God of War3,"Familiar but thrilling - sits easily among PS3's gods, if shy of the throne. [Apr 2010, p.94]"
2010,God of War3,The gory epic is even more so this time. Playing Kratos is still pure ownage and with the exception of a few niggles the game is incredibly polished with awesome visuals. [Apr 2010]
2010,God of War3,"It's not perfect, with some uneven storytelling and progression here and there, but it's still a fantastic overall package. The combat is stellar once again, it's bloodier than ever, and it is at times the best looking game ever released."
2010,God of War3,"The ending may not be the most satisfying conclusion to a trilogy, but the journey there is pure action-adventure bliss."
2010,God of War3,"God of War III is polished from (severed) head to (bloodied) toe, and is an enjoyable, ridiculous experience perfect for the moments where you just want to switch your brain off."
2010,God of War3,"An epic, over-sized gorefest unlike any other. Sorry EA, Kratos is still the king of brutal brawlers."
2010,God of War3,"It's incredibly familiar and a bit brief, but God of War III still stands as a herculean achievement. A lot of TLC went into its creation and it comes shining through at every turn. The tweaks to the gameplay are minimal and the lack of titan interaction feels like a missed opportunity, but when Kratos is swinging his hypnotizing blades it's easy to forget that the rest of the world even exists."
2010,God of War3,"Everything you were expecting and more. It really delivers with extremely upgraded graphics, a quality soundtrack, easy-to-learn controls, varied weapons and powers, challenging battles, enemy diversity, plenty of boss battles, immersive puzzles, a story that ties up the loose ends, and much more. My only gripe is the lack of innovation."
2010,God of War3,"Kratos' grim story of brutal determination and the game's overall non-stop mechanical and presentational excellence make for a gripping, gorgeous and gory experience with an unforgettably gruff, ass-kicking hero; whom the gods would destroy, they would first make bad."
2010,God of War3,"If you liked the previous God of War titles, you're going to feel right at home with this one."
2010,God of War3,"God of War III is the very definition of an epic experience. The combat is brutal and fluid, the sense of scale is massive and the presentation is nothing short of amazing. Even though the third iteration of the series adds little or nothing to the original formula it's impossible not to be engulfed in this roller coaster of epic moments. A worthy conclusion to the trilogy indeed."
2010,God of War3,"The return of Kratos is a powerful one, and the years Sony Santa Monica have spent on polishing every segment of the game have really paid off."
2010,God of War3,"Just like the God of War games that precede it, this final installment in the trilogy isn't quite faultless even though it's excruciatingly close to a perfect score. However, it forms a trilogy that's greater than the sum of its parts."
2010,God of War3,"The reality is the game delivers exactly what any fan of the games could want - epic battles, loads of gore and a plot vehicle that sees Kratos take on the mightiest characters in Greek Mythology."
2010,God of War3,"If you're after a hard-hitting and adrenaline-fueled action experience God of War III is the ultimate game on the market, and Kratos' final battle with the gods takes the genre to new heights. 44 million dollars well spent."
2010,God of War3,"The key to God of War III's success, though - continuing on from that of its predecessors - is how finely balanced it is. So expertly administered are its parts that the repetition one would expect never emerges."
2010,God of War3,'God of War III' is a triumph that lives up to the hefty expectations that the studio set for itself-- and more importantly the expectations of the hardcore crowd who has been waiting on Kratos return.
2010,God of War3,"God of War III puts a glorious end to an epic trilogy, introducing astonishing scenarios and original gameplay solutions. It is simply the best hack ¡¥n slash out there right now. A must-buy even if you¡¦re not a fan of this genre!"
2010,God of War3,God of War III is not only a high definition upgrade on what is an already fantastic series; it is a game that improves on what it has done so well in the past
2010,God of War3,"If you played the first to games in the franchise you'll like this one even more. And if you didn't, you're going to love God of War 3."
2010,God of War3,The game is epic in scale and brutality and despite offering almost the same experience as past games key refinements and a never slowing pace mean the game provides a heart pounding experience that can't be missed.
2010,God of War3,God of War III is as brutal and suitable a conclusion as you could have possibly asked for. Kratos WILL get his revenge.
2010,God of War3,"God of War III is an epic game and a splendid conclusion to the series; its battles are fun, its bosses are huge and the task is entertaining. It is a title that all PlayStation 3 owners should own and is one of a number of impressive games recently released on the system."
2010,God of War3,"It takes everything that made the previous game so awesome and refines it. It continues the story, but it makes the effort to give more meaning to Kratos's journey and its eventual ending. It takes the previous established combat mechanics and makes them faster, tighter, and more fun than ever."
2010,God of War3,"Let there be no doubt: there couldn't have been a better end to this fantastic trilogy. Again and again your jaw will hit the floor in excitement. God of War III is so polished that the little mistakes will be all the more apparent, but it's nothing compared to what you get: an epic, well balanced action game."
2010,God of War3,"Overall, this is a top notch production that will not disappoint in the slightest."
2010,God of War3,"Third time is a charm ¡V fits perfectly to Kratos adventures. Better graphics, more gore clashes ¡V next time there has to be a massacre in the kindergarten if they want to beat this part. [Issue#189]"
2010,God of War3,"It's not perfect, but it's a satisfying experience from start to finish. Amazing to look at, fun to play and a great ending."
2010,God of War3,"The game is probably the most balanced of the three, but excitement wise it never quite reaches the heights of it's predecessors."
2010,God of War3,"The game is inches away from scoring 10/10, and it's only the familiarity of the core gameplay that makes it feel less than the very, very best. But it's definitely the biggest, and if this is the finale, then God of War III gives Playstation's toughest hero the send-off he deserves. [Mar 2010, p.97]"
2010,God of War3,Exhilarating combat and an imposing sense of scale provide a fitting end to Kratos' saga.
2010,God of War3,"God of War III is the perfect epilogue of a great trilogy. The game has no innovation, but it's gameplay is the perfect goal for the action games. Fast, epic, intense, God of War III is the perfect experience for the action gamer. Buy it, and love it!"
2010,God of War3,"A technical marvel, but with all the clever stuff turned towards the aim of very basic gratification. There are no branching paths, no complex decisions, and no multiplayer modes, but this particular game is all the better for it, since the results are rich and focused rather than drawn-out and a little ragged. Ultimately, if you want to revel in old-school pleasures decked out in the very brightest new armour, this is about as good as it gets."
2010,God of War3,God of War III is amazing and disturbing all at once.
2010,God of War3,"With creative freedom, Kratos's latest adventure is staggering in scale, superbly visualised and, for the most part, an absolute joy to play through. And most importantly, where it counts ¡V the action sequences ¡V God of War III is utterly unmatched and unequaled, and therefore absolutely essential for action fans."
2010,God of War3,"But as a fan who actually cares about Kratos and his plight, I found it to be a bit of a letdown. Even though I thoroughly enjoyed the journey, I can't help but feel disappointed by the way Kratos chose to say goodbye at the end of it."
2010,God of War3,"God of War 3 offers blood, death, brutality ¡V in all: fun ¡V on a gigantic scale. Kratos wanted his revenge and it¡¦s up to you to guide him on his blood-red journey where graphics, sound and tension come together to form a spectacle from start to finish. We cannot condone violence, but if it helps Kratos to reach his goal, there ain¡¦t no mountain high enough, there ain¡¦t no god strong enough. Amazing end to the trilogy."
2010,God of War3,"Suitably epic and still fun to play, Kratos's last outing isn't necessarily his finest. Hindered by some tired mechanics it's not as much of a step forward as we wanted. [Issue#190, p.61]"
2010,God of War3,God of War III ends with a bang. The trilogy end contains pretty much everything that you¡¦ve come to expect from the series with a few surprises along the way. We wish there were a little more titan battles but overall the story of Kratos gets a worthy ending.
2010,God of War3,"It's a fitting end to the series (well, at least Kratos) but it remains extremely close to the lines laid down by the previous two games in both form and content so as not to upset long-time fans."
2010,God of War3,"It's pretty much what we expect from this epic franchise, but the limited scope and fairly mundane ending hasn't rounded off this franchise with the dignity it deserves."
2010,God of War3,"As a technical spectacle, there's nothing like God Of War III, but while we're meant to truly feel the anguish of Kratos' bloody final battle, Sony hasn't yet trapped a ghost in the machine."
2010,God of War3,"But despite God of War III being afraid of flying too close to the sun -lest those carefully crafted wings should melt- the journey is relentlessly exciting; a blistering spectacle told in blood and thunder. Truly epic, then. And I defy anyone to argue with the definition this time around."
2010,God of War3,God of War III delivers the same riveting experience as its predecessors. While there isn't much innovation beyond the stunning visuals the core concept still remains sound. It's the most refined entry in the series and a worthy conclusion to the epic God of War saga.
2010,God of War3,"The stuff of legend, then? Indeed. Although, perhaps fittingly, one with nothing new to say. [Apr 2010, p.88]"
2010,God of War3,"The end result is certainly the best of the series, with the sense of scale and superb presentation overcoming most concerns over repetition and depth."
2010,God of War3,"The beautiful rendering of Kratos' ugliness is what made God of War III a compelling experience for me, despite of the bits that felt unnecessarily slavish to the God of War formula. Even if it's not the best God of War game, it's unequivocally the best-looking God of War to date, and it makes for a wicked showpiece for the PlayStation 3."
2010,God of War3,"We wish that Santa Monica had focused more on the epic scale that the opening of the game promises with such conviction, rather than relying on those elements of design we've already played through twice on the PlayStation 2. [Apr 2010, p.102]"
2010,God of War3,"The highlights of this iteration are all in the technology; as potent and polished a hack-and-slasher as God of War 3 can be, the myth of its continuing relevance in design circles has worn thin. Series fans should and will invest, as there's fundamentally nothing broken here that wasn't broken before, but don't come expecting a bold rebirth, and don't come expecting the game of the year. Kratos is a frequent visitor to the Underworld; perhaps it's time he stayed there."
2010,God of War3,"The strength of the game's opening sequences and some of the bosses really stuck with me, but some of the later levels just felt kind of...bleh. As far as being the show-stopper that blows the rest of the series away, it falls short."
2010,Halo: Reach,"Halo: Reach is without doubt Bungie's finest Halo game, and best of all it has the story and structure to the campaign to finally deliver the Halo experience that some of us have been waiting for since the original Halo: Combat Evolved launched on Xbox back in 2002."
2010,Halo: Reach,"Halo Reach has the best campaign appearing in consoles for Elites, the upgraded coop mode, the excellent enemy IA , the new skills ... and has an infinite multiplayer. Reach is the definitive Halo and one of the most important games in recent years."
2010,Halo: Reach,"Aside from some minor technical hurdles like occasional slowdown, it looks great, and plays like the best parts of all four Halo games up until now. If you were worrying that Bungie would phone it in for their swan song, worry no more. And that's not even getting into the multiplayer"
2010,Halo: Reach,"Halo: Reach, simply, is Bungie's masterwork, and if you own an Xbox 360, you'd be an idiot not to buy a copy ¡V even if you're not a fan of first-person shooters, it will still make you marvel at just how good a game can look and feel."
2010,Halo: Reach,"It's a fitting swansong for Bungie, setting a beautiful end that takes you right back to the very beginning."
2010,Halo: Reach,"There is simply not a better, more complete shooter on the market, and with all this content, there isn't any way you can find something that you cannot sink your teeth into."
2010,Halo: Reach,"Overall, Halo: Reach is an amazing title."
2010,Halo: Reach,"The only thing missing from this impressive entry is a number ""4"" in the title, because for all intents and purposes, Reach feels like the next big thing in the Halo franchise."
2010,Halo: Reach,"But after seeing the perfect last shot of the campaign (in fact, it's so spot-on, that Bungie community director Brian Jarrard confirms that, unlike previous titles, there's no additional cinematic or end-scene for finishing on Legendary difficulty -- everyone sees the same last scene), and playing round after round of multiplayer, I can say that while I admire and respect every previous Halo title, Reach is the Halo that I absolutely love."
2010,Halo: Reach,Reach is the most spectacularly euphoric hello and goodbye in gaming history.
2010,Halo: Reach,"Halo: Reach is bar none the most developed, robust, and title in the franchise."
2010,Halo: Reach,"Nine years in and on its fifth and final pass Bungie has created the definitive Halo experience, in which refinement is matched by the gentle revolutions of its new features."
2010,Halo: Reach,"ODST could have been a clever little shimmy, but it came out a misstep. Reach brings us right back into the dance that hooked us nine years ago, introduces some cool new steps, and leaves us twirling in enchantment as Bungie graciously bows out. Just keep twirling, Spartan."
2010,Halo: Reach,Halo: Reach is everything a Halo fan has ever dreamed for. All that was lacking from previous Halo games is here and then some. This is Bungie's love letter to their fans and they've definitely gone out with a bang.
2010,Halo: Reach,"While no game will ever be perfect, Halo: Reach is as close as Bungie is going to get with the series, and I think they knew that going in. So they did their damndest to make sure it lived up to its namesake, probably even more so than Halo 3 did."
2010,Halo: Reach,"Halo is their story, and with Reach you feel they have just closed the book. It may not have the lasting impact of Combat Evolved, but as a refinement of the idea --the essence-- of Halo, it is their finest work yet."
2010,Halo: Reach,A beautiful magnum opus. A modern shooter with polish and a sense of detail that makes Halo: Reach the new reference title for first person shooters. An engaging single player experience and a brilliant multiplayer game. One of the best shooters ever.
2010,Halo: Reach,Halo: Reach is the final and definitive Halo game with more content and entertainment than any Halo fan ever could ask for.
2010,Halo: Reach,"Halo: Reach is undoubtedly one of the biggest games of this year, and although it's sad to know that there isn't going to be another one any time soon (well, not from Bungie anyway), it's also good to know that ¡V over the eight years that Halo has been around ¡V Bungie have managed to take every part of each game, and mix them together into one big recipe for success ¡V for avid fans and newcomers alike, for years to come."
2010,Halo: Reach,"If you felt you have moved on from Halo and that it is no longer relevant, than you are truly mistaken. Yes, Reach is another Halo, but Bungie refined and tweaked the formula to make it stand its ground and make it as addicting as it was in 2001."
2010,Halo: Reach,"Suffice it to say that while it's not a perfect game, it's definitely the best Halo game yet and a fittingly epic goodbye to fans from Bungie, the developer that helped to launch a million Xboxes."
2010,Halo: Reach,The FPS epic comes full circle. Pure quality.
2010,Halo: Reach,"Few are the areas where Halo : Reach doesn't benefit from Bungie's obvious intention to deliver a definitive farewell episode. Aside from french voices and music that are simply good (but not as fantastic as one would hope every single aspect to be), and new covenant weapons slightly off when used in the solo campaign, Reach delivers a brilliant solo experience. The story may not be surprising, but it's a well told one. Reach remains awe-inspiring for its implementation, scope, diversity and richness. Those who will have to carry on the flame have a high bar set there for them to surpass."
2010,Halo: Reach,"I think it's more akin to the original Halo CE than any of the previous games, and while I totally enjoyed both Halo 3 and ODST a great deal, it's hard to deny that this is the best of Xbox 360 entries into the series."
2010,Halo: Reach,"If you're a fan of the Halo series and were a little disappointed with ODST and a little apprehensive in purchasing this title, don't be. Bungie have redeemed themselves by not only creating an engaging and coercive story but have brought the game back to its roots and tweaked the gameplay, both offline and online to make this the definitive game of the series."
2010,Halo: Reach,Halo: Reach is the closest thing I've seen to a perfect shooter.
2010,Halo: Reach,"Almost everything about Halo: Reach is perfect. The campaign feels great other than a few slow spots and stupid AI - and the multiplayer and matchmaking set a standard that all FPS games should be following. On top of that, the customization that Bungie has given players access to is second to none."
2010,Halo: Reach,"Halo: Reach manages to out-deliver Halo 3 - which was itself one of the most over-delivered game's in history. The updated visuals and AI engine combine with the ever more nuanced and varied gameplay, not to mention online modes and other new gadgets, to make this a game not to be missed."
2010,Halo: Reach,"Unfathomably deep, customizable, user-friendly, and straight-up engrossing multiplayer modes."
2010,Halo: Reach,"Halo: Reach again sets the benchmark of how to make a combat game, be it first or third person. Its freedom to be played and approach any situation makes it a unique game. Its only flaw is the duration of the story, a bit shot, although many will feel compensated by its overwhelming multiplayer mode."
2010,Halo: Reach,"Any disappointment series fans felt after ODST should be completely washed away thanks to Reach. Make no mistake about it - this is the true follow-up to Halo 3. It's also a perfect way for Bungie to part with the series it turned into a phenomenon. [Oct 2010, p.92]"
2010,Halo: Reach,Halo Reach feels like their goodbye love letter to Halo fans and it's apparent that they've put a lot of heart and soul into making this a memorable Halo title even without the Chief
2010,Halo: Reach,"In conclusion Halo: Reach is one of the most feature rich packages available on the Xbox 360 to date. Bungie has taken the time to ensure that every included mode, option and feature has been polished to perfection."
2010,Halo: Reach,"The end result is the best Halo title since Combat Evolved. Halo: Reach isn't about to convert any of the Halo haters out there, but it will keep fans of the franchise busy for months if not years to come."
2010,Halo: Reach,"Even if you've grown tired of the Halo formula through the years, I'd still recommend this game to you. It's just that good."
2010,Halo: Reach,"Though its deep roots may not win over those who haven't enjoyed previous games in the series, Halo: Reach is a towering achievement that delivers an enormous amount of engaging content that players will no doubt be enjoying for years to come."
2010,Halo: Reach,Halo: Reach is the Bungie's last goodbye to a saga that mostly made what Xbox 360 and Xbox Live are right now. And it's a lot of the things every Halo fan could have hoped for. It won't be easy for the new team to pick up Master Chief from where Bungie left him.
2010,Halo: Reach,"Halo: Reach, more than any other game in the series, truly belongs in this generation; It's everything fans want it to be and more."
2010,Halo: Reach,"Did I thoroughly enjoy Halo: Reach? Yes, very much so. Will I ever watch a cut scene from this game ever again? No. Will this game continue to remain in high play rotation on my Xbox? Very yes."
2010,Halo: Reach,"Almost achieves the impossible and fulfills the hype. Among the best shooters ever created. [Issue#231, p.82]"
2010,Halo: Reach,"The single player is superior and more epic than anything that's been achieved on a console before, and its multiplayer cooperative and competitive will be enjoyed for thousands of gamers for months. Reach is the last Halo game from Bungie, and they just have raised the level of what to expect in the series for years to come."
2010,Halo: Reach,"The closer you get to the end, the more ""nostalgic"" it gets, if you want to call it that. There's really no question about this one. Just get it."
2010,Halo: Reach,"Bungie wanted to go out with a bang, but instead, they've gone out with a nuclear explosion that not even a Spartan could survive. It's the end of an era, that's for sure, but the beginning of a new one. Step up 343, you have some big boots to fill."
2010,Halo: Reach,"Halo: Reach finds its strength in a varied and balanced gameplay, a deep and dramatic story and gorgeous environments, aside from the many multiplayer modes with virtually infinite customization possibilities. We're only left with a little bit of delusion for the lack of really surprising and memorable moments during the story, like the ones the series accustomed us to. Notwithstanding, Bungie closes its run on Halo with a great game that both fans and newcomers will find highly satisfying."
2010,Halo: Reach,A worthy sign off from Bungie who create another masterpiece to end its tenure with the Halo series.
2010,Halo: Reach,"Although Halo: Reach is not perfect, it does come pretty darn close to being one of the best first person shooters ever."
2010,Halo: Reach,"Now four games into the series there's no denying that the campaign is starting to lose some of its moxie, yet there's just enough revelation here for fans to cling to. But let's be honest. You're going to decide to buy based on its multiplayer component and this is where it delivers in spades."
2010,Halo: Reach,"The Single Player is far away from perfection. It lacks drama, and the pace isn't that high. But, as usual, Bungie delivers a complete multiplayer experience. Thanks to FireFight and to the new game modes, Reach is one of the best online FPS, and it will last for years."
2010,Halo: Reach,"As the multiplayer king that it is, it is safe to say that the machine has, again, risen. All I can say, in the end, is kudos Bungie and thanks for the memories; I have loved Halo."
2010,Halo: Reach,"In closing, Halo Reach is a must have title for any fan of the series (which by now, you should know if you are or not) and even if you aren't a fan of the previous titles you may find that the lengths Bungie have gone to refine their formula will now win you over."
2010,Halo: Reach,"A beautiful, astoundingly deep - yet very familiar - Halo package. Thanks for the memories, Bungie."
2010,Halo: Reach,"It won't court the anti-Haloites back into the fold, but it will more than satisfy the fans and will create plenty of news ones in the process. For Bungie's final stab at the Halo universe (for the foreseeable future), Reach is the swan song legacy that every developer strives for."
2010,Halo: Reach,Halo: Reach is the ultimate Halo game.
2010,Halo: Reach,"As much as Bungie wanted to sell Halo: Reach as a story-driven first person shooter rife with the familiar golden gameplay methods fans have come to expect from a Halo title, Halo: Reach doesn't answer to this standard. The game ultimately shines in its ridiculously fun and addictive gameplay that sees its mastery in the various multiplayer modes available."
2010,Halo: Reach,"I do have some complaints; namely a short campaign (seven hours), cowardly AI Spartans, an undercooked plot, and it's obviously disappointing that Bungie is no longer at the bleeding edge of graphics technology (as it was with Halo and Halo 2) but at the end of the day we've got an absolute treasure trove of gameplay for shooter die-hards."
2010,Halo: Reach,"While the torch has been passed to fledgling studio 343 Productions for future Halo content and games, Bungie's final effort in this universe still stands as a fantastic final chapter to a gaming dynasty that's lasted most of a decade."
2010,Halo: Reach,"Reach couldn't be expected to replicate the impact of Combat Evolved, but it's superior in just about every other way. Mission accomplished."
2010,Halo: Reach,Halo: Reach is a well-designed and intricate shooter experience; one of the best on the gaming scene today.
2010,Halo: Reach,"Reach is dramatic, emotional, engaging, cinematic and we are satisfied with the hardness thrown in heroic difficulty."
2010,Halo: Reach,"Reach is a fine conclusion to Bungie's stewardship of the series, but that's what stops it from being anything more. Halo felt like the future. Reach is merely a brilliantly engineered present."
2010,Halo: Reach,Bungie has listened to the fans and brings them the good old Halo formula with a brand new twist. Halo: Reach will keep gamers locked in their rooms for months to come thanks to a ton of new game modes and options.
2010,Halo: Reach,"It's not the perfect shooter by any stretch, if indeed such a thing could exist, but as a multiplayer effort there's every reason to expect the game to reach far into the coming year and beyond."
2010,Halo: Reach,"Halo: Reach will inevitably become one of the biggest games of the year, if not in gaming history and as Bungie's last Halo it is something of a fitting tribute to what has gone before. It may not deliver the same emotional attachment as playing as the chief, but it does provide an epic if somewhat somber experience that ends where it all began and becomes a must for any Halo fan."
2010,Halo: Reach,"A so-so campaign isn't the send-off that Halo deserved. Incredible online options are. [Dec 2010, p.71]"
2010,Halo: Reach,"All the experience Bungie earned with the Halo-series are used here to pull Reach to a higher plan. This game will never have the same impact as the original Halo, but that doesn't take away the fact that Reach is the best Halo-game. Ever."
2010,Halo: Reach,"Reach captures what you love about Halo, refining it on the multiplayer side and preserving the fluid, dynamic, ever-surprising campaign action that makes most rivals look like clumsy shooting galleries."
2010,Halo: Reach,"The robust and extensive suite of features make for a compelling overall package. It's an incredible campaign, and its less bombastic plot and clear-cut story stop it from getting bogged down in the sense of being overworked."
2010,Halo: Reach,"Reach is the best Halo ever created by Bungie. Great graphics, excellent storyline and the usual perfect multiplayer, make this game a ""must buy"" not for every Halo fan, but also for everyone playing first person shooters. Unfortunately, a 5-hour single-player campaign prevents the game from gaining that perfect score that it would have otherwise deserved."
2010,Halo: Reach,"This is Halo at its best. You might miss Master Chief, but all the other multiplayer modes will keep your mind on track."
2010,Halo: Reach,"A good finale, maybe not the epic one everyone was waiting for. Halo Reach will make the fans rejoice, especially with its incredible multiplayer side. On the other hand, the single player experience is somehow flawed by a fragmentary plot, a short lifespan, some small bugs and the missing ""team feeling"". It's a great shooter, but it won't be remembered as the best of this generation as some believed."
2010,Halo: Reach,"Everything has been enhanced and improved so much, that Bungie at least deserve kudos for all the effort they put in. This is definitely the most complete Halo game to date, and well worth the money. Hell, It may even live up to its own hype."
2010,Halo: Reach,"Epic beyond what we'd expect from a Halo game, typically well-polished and boasting impeccable shooter design. [Issue#64, p.80]"
2010,Halo: Reach,"So should you buy it? If you like Halo, it's a resounding yes - this is the best Halo ever (even if it is - by far - the hardest). If you like multiplayer first-person shooters, it's an ""almost definitely"" (fans of realistic shooters need not apply). If you want the world's most polished single player experience? A less enthusiastic response is appropriate."
2010,Halo: Reach,"It maybe not be the perfect ending for the franchise because of its prequel flair, but in the gameplay and story-telling aspects it easily earns the crown of the series."
2010,Halo: Reach,Bungie's last Halo game is a great prequel to the Xbox 360's most important franchise. However the game is not as excellent as we had hoped it would be. While playing through the campaign we were missing those special moments we experienced during the first three games of the series. The multiplayer part of the game is - once again - awesome.
2010,Halo: Reach,"Nearly everything about this game has been improved over its predecessors, and though the campaign won't take you too long to complete, the hours you'll spend with the multiplayer more than make up for it."
2010,Halo: Reach,"As a Halo game it rivals the nostalgia Combat Evolved instilled in us nearly a decade ago due to fully realized online multiplayer components and customizability; as a shooter, however, it feels almost as dated in so much there's little separating the core experience from past iterations."
2010,Halo: Reach,Halo: Reach is 2010's multiplayer title of the year.
2010,Halo: Reach,"If multiplayer is your thing, it's a must-have title. If you're a hardcore Halo fan looking to flesh out the story and really just want more of the same, then pick it up. If you're looking for an innovative FPS that pushes boundaries and helps define the genre, though, you may want to look elsewhere. Reach is fun, but it doesn't provide the same kick in the ass as your first time through the original Halo."
2010,Halo: Reach,"If you loved all the other Halo games, there's little I can say to dissuade you from purchasing Bungie's last creation in the Halo series."
2010,Halo: Reach,"Its claim to being combat-evolved grows ever more tenuous, but Bungie's last Halo is still the most fully featured first person shooter ever."
2010,Halo: Reach,"It's the arcade/arena/vehicle/sci-fi shooter of this generation, no doubt. Any Halo fan without Reach misses out on what's sure to be a great addition to their library. A game changer, however, it is not."
2010,Halo: Reach,"With a good amount of variation, great controls and an excellent multiplayer mode, Halo: Reach goes a long way. Though it stutters in its cheesy story, dull characters and ugly textures, the multiplayer mode in combination with a decent story makes it a very pleasant game."
2010,Halo: Reach,"Reach is clearly a tribute to ten years of a successful franchise and we expected Bungie to leave the Halo universe with a bang. The problem is that it's too multiplayer oriented, and the single player campaign lacks punch and is too short."
2010,Halo: Reach,"Reach is a solid title, but Halo gameplay is getting stale. Fans should purchase, everyone else could make do with a rental."
2010,Halo: Reach,"Halo: Reach is far from the classic that many would have you believe, it's all too easy to bask in the hype and become bludgeoned by the praise. Time will show that it falls short, but nevertheless online is Bungie's masterpiece."
2010,Halo: Reach,"While it hardly represents the pinnacle of the genre, as a complete package and fan service, Halo: Reach is just about the pinnacle of the Halo series."
2010,Halo: Reach,"Bungie says a fond farewell with Reach. The Single Players does nothing new as supposed to the previous games, but Reach is more defined by its excellent depth in multi player than anything else."
2010,Halo: Reach,"You can (and should) basically ignore the singleplayer portion of Halo Reach. If you must 'experience' it make friends with a diehard Halo fan, let them deal with the litany of gameplay problems and enjoy the story with their guidance."
2010,Halo: Reach,"It's a Halo game through and through, with the same style and pacing that you've come to expect, but with a new cast of characters that are worth paying attention to and a multiplayer mode that has more variety than it's ever had before. It's not going to change your mind about Halo, but this special delivery for fans of the franchise is a great send-off as Bungie ends its involvement with the franchise to go work on something new."
2010,Halo: Reach,"Do you buy Halo mostly for the multiplayer? Then Reach is everything you'd want and expect from Bungie's final contribution to the franchise ¡V perfectly polished familiarity with exactly the right amount of fresh features and bold risk-taking. If you're counting on an epic, sweeping and satisfying campaign story, however, you might want to keep waiting for Halo 4."
2010,Halo: Reach,"Bungie tries. Kat, Noble 6's intelligence officer and estrogen-powered ass-kicker, is the most entertaining of your compatriots. But she and all the characters in Halo: Reach are one-note Johnnies, all swagger and no depth."
2010,Halo: Reach,The campaign attempts to wrap itself in the dramatic cloak of human tragedy but fails to deliver on that emotive promise.
2010,Halo: Reach,"Halo: Reach is not a breakthrough, yet it's a clear showcase ofBungie's creative growth. The game is hardly a ""must buy"" ¡V itssingle-player campaign is way too short and uneven in quality, whilemultiplayer has very little room for expansion besides map packs anduseless character decorations. But with that said, Reach is worthy ofyour attention for a couple of evenings."
2010,Halo: Reach,"To get it straight, Halo Reach is just what Halo 3 should have been at its release, three years ago."
2010,Halo: Reach,"In a game absolutely packed with embarrassing relics of the first Halo-silly Covenant vehicle design, the Spartans' ridiculous looking low-G jump existing alongside a modern physics engine, the return to one gun at a time-Bungie chose to fix only a multiplayer game mode."
2010,Halo: Reach,Quite a good add-on to the HALO family comes with no extra news but its content would satisfy all fans. Shortened game length is for the better ¡V you won't get bored over time. [Issue#196]
2010,Halo: Reach,"That high-fiving, frat-house, epithet-spewing, tea-bagging culture has had the unfortunate side-effect of making the Halo universe increasingly less soulful, rendering the subtitle of the original game-""Combat evolved""-something of an oxymoron."
2010,Halo: Reach,"Halo is still a superlative multiplayer game, and with a group of friends, there's nothing quite like a well-tuned game mode or a white-knuckle finish to a Firefight. It's a shame that Halo: Reach couldn't add $60 worth of improvements to it."
2010,Mass Effect 2,"Despite all of the ways Mass Effect 2 is more engaging to play and explore, after 35 remarkable hours it was the characters that stayed with usÿ Game of the year in January? Oh, go on then. [Feb 2010, p.112]"
2010,Mass Effect 2,"Both an astonishing RPG and confident shooter, Mass Effect 2 is daring, shocking and often awe-inspiring in its use of choice. This is the future of storytelling in videogames. [Issue#, p.85]"
2010,Mass Effect 2,"It's mature: not because of profanity or nudey bits, but because it tackles complicated themes without telling you what to think. Having already sunk a distressing number of hours into ME2, the second this sentence is finished we're firing it up and exploring the rest of the universe."
2010,Mass Effect 2,"Mass Effect 2 is the perfect fusion of the shooter and RPG genres. When you're not playing it, you wish you were. When you are playing it, you can't imagine doing anything else. Engrossing, captivating, stunning. Roll on DLC, and Mass Effect 3."
2010,Mass Effect 2,"Mass Effect 2 delivers the best experience of its kind in this generation-and considering I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since I finished my initial 39-hour playthrough a few days ago, a lower score would feel disingenuous. From its mechanics to its writing to its presentation, Mass Effect 2 is the kind of game that justifies gushing clich_s and superlatives. I can't recommend it highly enough."
2010,Mass Effect 2,"Mass Effect 2 strikes a perfect balance between intense shooter action and gut-wrenching drama, set in a richly textured world on the brink of destruction. It's a must-own for science fiction fans, who will love exploring the depths of the galaxy and fighting to save humanity."
2010,Mass Effect 2,"We can't do anything but to celebrate another masterpiece from Bioware, a game that has never been so close to perfection. If you have not upgraded your PC yet, it's time to do it; if you you needed an excuse to buy an Xbox 360, now you have one. Not to play this game would be crazy."
2010,Mass Effect 2,"Perhaps BioWare's greatest success in Mass Effect 2 has been taking a complex RPG and making it effortless to understand, play and enjoy on a constant basis, because it has done this in a manner that should prove utterly essential to veterans and newcomers alike, and more than enough to suggest Mass Effect 3 will be the most important game in BioWare's history."
2010,Mass Effect 2,"My journey with Commander Shepherd opened up a new view of what this form of entertainment can do, and allowed me to emotionally connect (and care) with the virtual characters on my television screen. The dialogue, story progression, graphics, soundtrack, controls, and presentation are all well above what so many other games of this genre are offering these days... PlanetXbox360.com has never given a perfect score, until now."
2010,Mass Effect 2,"The fluid systems -- the navigation, the combat, and the quick-fire missions -- combine to make Mass Effect 2 an RPG that challenges the genre conventions. The superb emphasis on character development, the gripping plot elements and big-budget presentation aren't too bad either."
2010,Mass Effect 2,It's the way that Mass Effect 2 expands upon the narrative established in the first game that marks a true breakthrough for interactive storytelling.
2010,Mass Effect 2,"Mass Effect not only is the best RPG of this generation, but also an excellent action game that will appeal a broader audience. It's one of those few titles that we'll still be talking about in many years to come."
2010,Mass Effect 2,"If you liked Mass Effect 1 to any degree whatsoever, you¡¦ll definitely love Mass Effect 2 with its improved combat and AI, and cinematics and storyline ¡V sans the glitches we all know and hate from ME1."
2010,Mass Effect 2,"Mass Effect 2 far exceeded our expectations and is without question one of the best games we've played. Use whatever positive description you'd like. System seller, potential game of the year, landmark achievement; just make sure you buy it immediately."
2010,Mass Effect 2,"If you even remotely enjoy a good narrative, this game is a must buy. Fans of the original are in for a treat as everything that was wrong with the last game has been fixed. Mass Effect 2 truly is the definitive entry in the series, and quite possibly the best BioWare game to be released thus far."
2010,Mass Effect 2,"Mass Effect 2 is an epic in every sense, not forgetting anything. It can hold us until the last second, and still allows us to go further."
2010,Mass Effect 2,"This is a series that deserves its own place in gaming history and while there will always be comparisons of where it originated from. It's nice to know that there can be a story told in space that is so epic, so intelligent, and so rewarding, that doesn't have to have the word ""Star"" in its title."
2010,Mass Effect 2,"The second part of the Mass Effect saga is nothing short of a milestone in game design. The technical issues present in the first game are now gone, a fact that's beautifully demonstrated by the improved graphics engine. There's a ton of worlds to explore, an amazing roster of characters to recruit and a great and engaging story. But Bioware's major feat is how all your decisions have a major impact on how the story, and thereby the trilogy, unfolds."
2010,Mass Effect 2,"Mass Effect started with a huge stable of good ideas. Maybe the task of executing on all those ideas was too great for any one development team to accomplish in a single game, but BioWare has really gotten it right the second time around. They took those same ideas and figured out a better way to combine them into a more cohesive, more playable sequel that makes good on every bit of Mass Effect's potential and leaves me staring very grudgingly at the presumable two-year wait until my own Commander Shepard can continue his fight in the next game."
2010,Mass Effect 2,"Mass Effect 2 is a superb adventure, a deep gameplay experience, action packed and stuffed full of amazing vistas, If you own an Xbox 360 you have to buy this game. It's every bit the the smart, sexy, thrilling, moving, funny, tense game we hoped it would be."
2010,Mass Effect 2,"Great role-playing uses unpredictable situations to provoke unexpected responses in players, and accordingly, Mass Effect 2 is surprising time and again."
2010,Mass Effect 2,"More importantly though, Mass Effect 2 is simply an amazing game from start to finish, regardless of the decisions you choose to make."
2010,Mass Effect 2,"Few games take as many risks, and even less actually emerge for the better, but Mass Effect 2 pays off in an almost effortless fashion. Not one to be missed."
2010,Mass Effect 2,"The fabulous storytelling, innovative dialogue system and impact of your choices remains in full force, and that¡¦s all you really need to make a great RPG: the actual role-playing. The commitment from Bioware in making this franchise the best it can be is astounding."
2010,Mass Effect 2,"It¡¦s forty-plus hours of top-notch combat, incredible voice-acting, emotional provocation, stunning graphics and exhilarating gameplay of a standard that simply hasn¡¦t been achieved before as a complete package."
2010,Mass Effect 2,"The only thing that shocked us more was the fact that we instantly wanted to play it again from the beginning. With Mass Effect 2, BioWare have created an astonishing video game which is likely to entrance casual and hard-core players alike. The only requirement one needs to enjoy Mass Effect 2 is an inclination to become lost in its dark and wondrous universe. Oh, and perhaps a week off work."
2010,Mass Effect 2,The second chapter of this beautiful Bioware saga stands with right among the most enjoyable and immersive adventures ever created for the videogame industry. Its artistic value shines above every universe ever imagined by any videoplayer or game designer.
2010,Mass Effect 2,"The recipe is easy: More action, less roleplaying. Oh boy, Mass Effect 2 is a fun game!"
2010,Mass Effect 2,"But it all boils down to the fact that you need to play this game. Because once this trilogy is done, we might well be looking at one of the greatest science-fiction works ¡V in any medium ¡V of all time. Mass Effect 2 is an utterly absorbing, satisfying and rewarding journey that you absolutely will not want to end, ever."
2010,Mass Effect 2,"Unprecedented story telling, superb soundtrack, exciting characters and intense, varied battles... Mass Effect 2 is a must-buy for any roleplaying gamer and already is one of this year's best games."
2010,Mass Effect 2,"Mass Effect 2 has the balance of an RPG as well as plentyt of action and adventure, making it the perfect console game."
2010,Mass Effect 2,This bottom line is that this game is borderline perfect.
2010,Mass Effect 2,"If I had to sum up the game in two words, it would be ""captivating"" and ""cool"" as developers BioWare have really gone beyond the original and have made a large toy box, even bigger."
2010,Mass Effect 2,"Simply put, Mass Effect 2 is a game that everyone should play."
2010,Mass Effect 2,I commend the development team at BioWare for all the hard work that went into making this title not only shine but feel both familiar and completely fresh at the same time.
2010,Mass Effect 2,"Mass Effect 2 is easily one of the best games of the generation, blowing away its predecessor in just about every way, and removing the ""flawed"" attachment to the ""masterpiece"" title."
2010,Mass Effect 2,"The loss of RPG elements may hit some people hard, and the repetition in minigames may lead to yawns and tired eyes, but none of these faults hold Mass Effect 2 back from being a work of bold ambition, and one of gaming¡¦s most exciting sequels."
2010,Mass Effect 2,"Substantial improvements, great story, amazing character developmentÿit¡¦s not often that you get to name a ¡§Game of the Year¡¨ candidate in January but guess what, I¡¦m doing it now!"
2010,Mass Effect 2,"Bioware has delivered everything they have promised with Mass Effect 2, and then some."
2010,Mass Effect 2,"There's just so much here to experience, and it's all uniformly excellent in execution. BioWare has delivered on its promise to let us affect this massive world through our actions, and you can bet that we'll be playing this one through several times in anticipation of how it all pans out."
2010,Mass Effect 2,"Mass Effect 2 is a work of unreserved genius that not only surpasses its predecessor in almost every conceivable department, but also deserves to be listed alongside the greatest science-fiction properties in any medium. The perfect blend of rich, lustrous visuals, an evocative soundtrack and pure gameplay quality make Mass Effect 2 without question one of the best games of this or any generation, and anyone who believes otherwise, is just plain wrong."
2010,Mass Effect 2,"The two halves¡V the rewarding combat and the massive role playing element ¡V will provide something for everyone. If you¡¦re a fan of both camps, then you really need to get this. A wonderful, immersive tale that sets things up superbly for the finale, which, based on the evolution Mass Effect 2 has showed, should be magnificent."
2010,Mass Effect 2,"It's incredibly personal while still retaining a sense of epic sweeping scale. The combat and mission design are outstanding. The visuals, voice acting, soundtrack, and direction are miles ahead of the competition. Perhaps most impressively, Mass Effect 2 manages to fulfill its incredible ambition while only suffering from very few technical hiccups."
2010,Mass Effect 2,Mass Effect 2 resumes with pride the path opened by the first game. This sequel is a lesson of how things should be made.
2010,Mass Effect 2,"Storytelling, atmosphere, playability, graphics, music, characters, everything in Mass Effect 2 screams the word KOLOSSAL out loud! This game, and this saga, deserve to sit right next to Sci-Fi classics such as Star Wars and Star Trek. Masterpiece."
2010,Mass Effect 2,"Mass Effect 2 is a worthy successor to the original, and whilst it's a surprise to see the legends of hardcore RPG developers BioWare take a step away from the RPG and into the third-person shooter; it's one that will appeal to a far larger audience and when it's at this level of brilliance - everyone should be lucky enough to enjoy it."
2010,Mass Effect 2,Bioware has done it again; and even better this time.
2010,Mass Effect 2,"Although the sequel suffers a little from being the middle game of the trilogy and the stepping stone of the (hopefully) grand finale, Mass Effect 2 is extremely well polished and improved from its predecessor in almost every respect."
2010,Mass Effect 2,"Mass Effect 2 overcomes its few gameplay weaknesses with a fantastic weave of dynamic combat, lavish presentation, and engaging character and weapon customization. But for all the myriad improvements that make Mass Effect 2's visuals so appealing and its combat so exhilarating, it's ultimately the way it moves us that makes it so memorable. [Feb 2010, p.56]"
2010,Mass Effect 2,Right now I¡¦m even salivating at the prospect of finishing up all of the extra content.
2010,Mass Effect 2,"Overall, Mass Effect 2 is a title that everyone has to experience. As fun as the first title was it did have its own share of issues. It¡¦s refreshing to see a development team take in all of the criticism from their previous title and use it to improve upon their concept for the sequel."
2010,Mass Effect 2,Mass Effect 2 is much more than a game. It¡¦s an ominous sci-fi-mystery-action-epic that continues to provide thrilling moments around every bend.

2010,Mass Effect 2,"Gamers looking for a beautiful action game with exciting storyline and an interesting setting need to look no further than Mass Effect 2. The improved gameplay formula creates a fluent experience and audio-visually the games goes all out. It may be a bit early to dish out ¡§game of the year¡¨, but Mass Effect 2 has everything to get that title. Highly recommended for every game lover."
2010,Mass Effect 2,"Some hardcore RPG fans will be disappointed by Mass Effect 2 - the higher focus on the shooter aspects of the first game and the streamlined nature of the combat might turn them away from the game. We'll call this their loss, because one thing is certain - Mass Effect 2 is the perfect blending of Shooter and RPG, mixing Gears of War style battles with one of the deepest, most immersive fictional universes in gaming history."
2010,Mass Effect 2,"Mass Effect 2 is an improvement over the original in almost every way. Bioware decided to focus more on the shooter aspect and less on the RPG aspect, but that streamlines the game and makes it significantly more enjoyable."
2010,Mass Effect 2,"For role playing fans, this is the pinnacle of the genre, an all encompassing experience that is quite simply hinged on it's own grandiose and success, a must play title. For shooter/action fans, there might be a lot of waffle to wade through, but the merits of sticking with it outweigh any of the potential downfalls. Again, a must play game."

2010,Mass Effect 2,"While it ultimately may be more evolutionary than revolutionary, Mass Effect 2 still sets a new, almost impossibly high benchmark for future games."
2010,Mass Effect 2,"Mass Effect 2 is seminal in its genre. It is individually brilliant in every aspect... The combat, the writing, voice acting, visuals, score and direction comes together to create an unmatchable experience, and we fear it will be a while before we see one of this quality and standard."
2010,Mass Effect 2,"The story is bigger and more personal, the combat and inventory have been refined for better execution and the overall presentation trumps the quality from the first game. Everything you could have hoped for in a sequel is made clear in Mass Effect 2."
2010,Mass Effect 2,"The game still probably won¡¦t appeal to RPG purists due to it being focused heavily towards the action gamer, but if you liked the original than the sequel is unmissable."
2010,Mass Effect 2,"The story does waver when it matters most, and the planet-scanning and other hacking mini-games are quite the bore, but aside from that Mass Effect 2 is a game that doesn't seem to put a foot wrong. Riveting use of characters and your involvement in their stories really make this one you can't miss."
2010,Mass Effect 2,"Mass Effect 2 maintained the promise of delivering a worthy sequel to the first game, improving it with a tighter shooter component and the brave choice of streamlining the RPG one. Our only complain is the sub-par story, lacking the complexity and intrigue of the first one. Despite this, it remains a game capable to amaze any sci-fi lover."

2010,Mass Effect 2,"Mass Effect 2 gives you an opportunity to play a role, but I'd be hesitant to call it a role-playing game. So what is it exactly? A really robust action-adventure?

[Feb 2010]"
2010,Mass Effect 2,"Mass Effect 2's greatest strength once again falls upon the beauty of its universe and the carefully interwoven character dramas underpinning the action. It's a fascinating and hugely enjoyable experience that serves not only as a reminder of how wide the valley between a 'great and an 'excellent' game actually is, but why BioWare is still one of the most vital and important developers out there today."
2010,Mass Effect 2,"Mass Effect 2 has quality oozing from every facet of its makeup.

2010,Mass Effect 2,"On most levels it¡¦s hard to fault Mass Effect 2; this is a sequel that polishes many of the original¡¦s faults, tightening the combat and turning the screw on Shepard in the fight to save humanity with an impressive flair. Those already in thrall to BioWare¡¦s magic will fall in love all over again with a game that¡¦s got the sweep and stagger of the very best sci-fi epics."
2010,Mass Effect 2,"While Mass Effect 1 was a good game, this sequel really just improves everything. With a wide range of gameplay tweaks and some slight nudges to the presentation, the game ends up really reaching its full potential."
2010,Mass Effect 2,"When Mass Effect 3 rolls around to bring this tale to its finale, I'd really like to see BioWare strike some sort of happy medium between the clumsily executed RPG mechanics of the first game and the stripped-down shooter feel of this sequel. But even with its simplified mechanics, ME2's story makes for a compelling odyssey."
2010,Mass Effect 2,"You won¡¦t give much attention to the unintuitive HUD, and the low level cap won¡¦t stop most from playing the game again with added difficulty or for multiple story options. You'll get frustrated, you'll ask yourself why, but you'll still love it. Facing the dark reality of Mass Effect 2 has its stumbles and slips, but it¡¦s a trip worth taking, no matter the destination."

2010,Mass Effect 2,"Mass Effect 2 may not have quite the depth and consequences of Dragon Age - although it's impossible to tell, as both games contain so many variables - but it's the more polished and confident of the two. It is arguably the best RPG of recent years, and as a standalone game, a sequel, and a lead-in to the final part of the trilogy, it's an unqualified success."
2010,Mass Effect 2,"An improvement on just about every aspect of the original game, with the exception of one tiny aspect; the very final battle. Mass Effect 2 sees BioWare's approach to the role playing genre evolve beyond anything they've worked on previously, and gives us a glimpse of how both RPGs and shooters will begin to merge in the years ahead."
2010,Mass Effect 2,"Once this intense and action-packed role-playing game pulls you into its orbit, you won't want to escape."
2010,Mass Effect 2,"With the first instalment, BioWare built a universe of words ¡V a deeply convincing multicultural sprawl you could read about without ever quite getting to touch. Here, you¡¦re inside it from the start ¡V and the view is often dazzling"
2010,Mass Effect 2,"By making choice, dialogue and characters the key ingredients, Mass Effect 2 delivers an experience in which the player feels directly at the core - more so than any other game we can think of.

2010,Mass Effect 2,"Much like the first Mass Effect, you can ignore everything that is wrong with Mass Effect 2, because it is just so good at everything that it does right. The faults are not as glaring as they were in the last game and you will be so enthralled with the amazing story, characters and combat that for the most part, you won't care anyway."
2010,Mass Effect 2,"From the war-torn home world of the lizardlike krogans to a planet so wracked by radiation that stepping out of the shade will eat away at your shields, the galaxy feels more lovely, lurid and dangerous this time around."
2010,Mass Effect 2,Mass Effect 2 improves in almost every way on its predecessor by offering smoother and more action-based combat while still retaining the quintessential interactive storytelling that's always been the hallmark of Bioware games.

2010,Mass Effect 2,"BioWare have not only built up a fascinating, rich universe, they've made another fantastic game in which you get to be a part of it. A masterful piece of video game storytelling and a great action RPG to boot."
2010,Mass Effect 2,"Science-fiction movie fans already had movies like Star Wars and Star Trek. Mass Effect 2 manages to finally give a big sci-fi epic to gamers. Thanks to the beautiful visual effects, the game shows a realistic and convincing way of telling an interactive story. On top of that, the game improves upon almost all of the mistakes of its predecessor, though some players might feel the game lacks some more profound RPG-elements."
2010,Mass Effect 2,"When all¡¦s said and done, and in spite of our qualms and nitpicks, Mass Effect 2 truly is an excellent game."

2010,Red Dead Redemption,"Red Dead Redemption has a beautiful virtual world with an enormous amount of things to do, an exciting story and fantastic action. The game not only shows a world of the past, but also makes the player reflect the times we live in now. An exceptional achievement for a game."
2010,Red Dead Redemption,"This is simply a beautiful game, and it's provided more than a few moments where I completely forgot where the hell I was supposed to be going while riding over golden hills at sunset or through the desert in the middle of a nighttime lightning storm. It doesn't quite convey the loneliness of the real empty spaces, but does compress the essence of all the varieties of land and weather native to those parts into a few hundred miles ride."
2010,Red Dead Redemption,A masterpiece not to be missed.
2010,Red Dead Redemption,The sandbox formula is far from dead: with RDR is taking another step forward.

2010,Red Dead Redemption,"A single player game that keeps on giving, is as good as if not better than Grand Theft Auto IV and is as beautiful as a Hollywood epic."
2010,Red Dead Redemption,The end of the game - and the outstanding epilogue - punctuates one of the most complete video game stories in a long time. The story will stay with the player for a long time afterwards - long after they get their hands on whatever the next ¡¥it¡¦ game happens to be.
2010,Red Dead Redemption,"If this game's concepts seem even remotely interesting to you, head out immediately to your nearest game store and slap your cash down. The single-player story alone is more than worth the price of admission, and the multiplayer is truly unique and will likely evolve into something very special as the community continues to grow."
2010,Red Dead Redemption,The game itself is absolutely spectacular...The sheer quality of Red Dead Redemption is evident right from the word go.
2010,Red Dead Redemption,"An unmissable game for any fan of the genre or great action adventures in general. We don¡¦t often get masterpieces around here, but this is certainly one of those moments in time when gamers will look back more fondly on a dusty old six shooter than anything that involves jacking cars."
2010,Red Dead Redemption,"With Red Dead Redemption, Rockstar succeeds in creating one of the most impressive open worlds I've ever seen in a game, and it's telling that -- even after playing for over 30 hours -- all I want to do is get back on my horse and gallop back into the wilderness."
2010,Red Dead Redemption,"The whole Wild West has been a huge missed opportunity for the video game industry, until now where we finally have a game that has put the Wild West back on the map."
2010,Red Dead Redemption,"The atmosphere is second to none, especially in regards to other games out there trying to wrangle the wild west. The characters, the world and the storyline all mesh perfectly to make an experience you wont soon forget."
2010,Red Dead Redemption,"It was a world I was gutted to leave, and as such stands among the best that PS3 has to offer. [June 2010, p.107]"
2010,Red Dead Redemption,"They've grown up again, giving players a more mature role to play as a man fighting to save his family rather than for more selfish reasons, and layer the story with a bit of human condition which hasn't been well-reflected up until just recently in video games."
2010,Red Dead Redemption,The sheer amount of stuff to seek out and do in this game makes it utterly enjoyable.

2010,Red Dead Redemption,"RDR is a phenomenal game that stands out as one of the year's best. The utmost attention to detail is apparent in every aspect, and is something that no gamer should miss."
2010,Red Dead Redemption,"If you¡¦re for the West, you will latch onto Redemption like an ornery rattlesnake. If the old West is of no particular interest to you, you still ought to find it difficult not to appreciate the incredible level of workmanship and depth on display here. It is a true opus. [July 2010 p.69]"
2010,Red Dead Redemption,"Although this is said of almost every single new Rockstar product, Red Dead Redemption is arguably their best effort to date, if only because it distills all of the lessons they've learned from their previous titles into an engaging, expansive, and enthralling world. But the best part of Rockstar's open-world oater is its honest and open appreciation for the iconic Western genre. [Aug 2010, p.82]"
2010,Red Dead Redemption,"It's a fantastic epic adventure and a title that belongs in every gamer's library. [Aug 2010, p.80]"

2010,Red Dead Redemption,"It's an artful take on a world long lost, an evocative paean to not only the Western genre but also to the beautiful expanse of the American landscape. Even better though is that under that remarkable feat is a game that's been refined and revitalised, setting the open world genre free and creating an experience that's quite likely to be one of this year's very best."

2010,Red Dead Redemption,"Without being a perfect game, Red Dead Redemption is, in my personal opinion, Rockstar¡¦s best effort to date.

2010,Red Dead Redemption,"With a world bigger than you can imagine dozens of random odd-jobs for you to perform and a story that keeps you hooked from beginning to end, Red Dead Redemption sets the standard for what games will judge themselves on in the future.

2010,Red Dead Redemption,"When Rockstar teased fans in 2005 with a video indicating an upcoming PS3 release, fans took notice ¡V sadly, it took nearly five years for the sequel ¡V Red Dead Redemption ¡V to hit the shelves. But believe me, it was worth the wait."
2010,Red Dead Redemption,"Red Dead Redemption is one of the most thrilling gaming experiences of all time.

2010,Red Dead Redemption,"Rockstar's latest feels like an actual location rather than a movie set, and it's compelling, cohesive, at once familiar and yet imbued with a sense of slack-jawed wonderment. It's also absolutely unmissable."

2010,Red Dead Redemption,"This is an outstanding game that tells a great story with memorable and occasionally laugh-out-loud-funny characters.

Now you have some idea of what's waiting for you in Red Dead Redemption."
2010,Red Dead Redemption,"Red Dead Redemption is more than just some basic concepts with a new coat of paint. Standing on it's own two feet, with out comparing it to anything else from Rockstar's past games...(Because of course something years later sure as heck should be better.).....Red Dead Redemption is a stellar game."
2010,Red Dead Redemption,"Rockstar has outdone itself with this enormous Wild West inspired sandbox adventure. In a world where outlaws rule, John Marston is perhaps the greatest of them all, befriending a dazzling cast of characters for his own need. Revenge."
2010,Red Dead Redemption,"With some glaring glitches and some so-so mission design, I can't in good conscience give the game a 10; but make no mistake, this game is the cat's pajamas. Get it."

2010,Red Dead Redemption,"'Red Dead Redemption' is a must buy. Every Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 owner should play this game (as long as they¡¦re over 18 and not a member of PETA). The only reasons I can¡¦t give this game a full 10 are the annoying glitches, connection issues and the lack of difficulty."

2010,Red Dead Redemption,"As a fan of the Western, Red Dead Redemption hits its target squarely. Perfection may be impossible, but this game gets closer than most, and it sets a new standard for the Western game genre."
2010,Red Dead Redemption,"Is this a better game than GTA? Technically, atmospherically, visually: absolutely. Narratively? Too subjective to call. Will you enjoy it more than GTA IV? That depends on how much you like the setting."
2010,Red Dead Redemption,"Red Dead Redemption is a triumph and although not entirely devoid of an assortment of little flaws and annoyances, it¡¦s still one of the best of the generation."

2010,Red Dead Redemption,"Red Dead Redemption is the best you could expect from Rockstar: a deep and lasting experience crowded with interesting characters and appealing missions. Where the title falls short is when it comes to facing the GTA IV legacy: you won't find innovation, if not in the beautiful environment. Still, a title you don't want to miss if you love either western setting, Rockstar titles or free roaming with a deep background."
2010,Red Dead Redemption,"Red Dead Redemption is a masterpiece. This game is the perfect example of how a developer should work to create the best atmosphere and to represent a beautiful historical situation. The graphics, the gameplay elements and everything else is at top level. Buy Red Dead Redemption, now!"
2010,Red Dead Redemption,"It offers the qualities we've come to expect from Rockstar in abundance, but just slips up short of GTA IV in delivering an experience that transcends the remit of a video game. Not quite a genre-defining experience, but one that offers a whole heap of entertainment for your money."
2010,Red Dead Redemption,"With Red Dead Redemption, Rockstar simply took the best from GTA and put it in the far west universe."
2010,Red Dead Redemption,"GTAIV¡¦s modern weapons spit bullets like angry hornets until a health circle depletes; here, lives end in uncompromising fashion. For the western aficionado, it is viciously accurate; for the fan of wanton sandbox carnage, it is comically frank."

2010,Red Dead Redemption,"In Redemption, Rockstar have succeeded in taking an over-subscribed genre and realizing it with such atmosphere and boundless possibility that it fluently captures the thrill of the Wild West, and with that they¡¦ve taken the Red Dead franchise into the big league, proud to stand alongside the best work they¡¦ve ever produced."
2010,Red Dead Redemption,"If you look at the main game, Red Dead Redemption isn't the best. With rock-bottom difficulty and an inane plot, grinding through John Marston's adventure is a tiresome experience. However, it's one of the best sandbox games ever released."
2010,Red Dead Redemption,"Gorgeous and feature packed, it's the new benchmark of open world adventures and a must play for gamers with itchy trigger fingers."
2010,Red Dead Redemption,"For all its achievements in aesthetics and game structure, perhaps the most significant feature of Red Dead Redemption is the way Rockstar has invested the experience with such a sense of nostalgia and poignancy, by stripping the open-world back to an era in which the telephone is the height of technology, an era which, in all its naivety, doesn¡¦t yet realise how fast the tide of progression and modernity will be."
2010,Red Dead Redemption,"Red Dead Redemption has its problems, and they are a shame. Thankfully, the game's heart and all the underpinning elements come together in such a way that you'll happily forgive the odd transgression as you gape at just how complete this world is."
2010,Red Dead Redemption,"It gives players a satisfying, open-world experience ¡V those who want to follow the main story can do so in about 15 hours, while the completionists will have a field day with all of the side missions and other items added into the game."
2010,Red Dead Redemption,"Rockstar does it again. Delivering a great game we mean. Red Dead Redemption has the gameplay of Grand Theft Auto, but situated in the Wild West. Go with John Marston through an exciting adventure in a great environment full of details. Besides some collision detection problems and many glitches/bugs Red Dead Redemption is a great game."
2010,Red Dead Redemption,Better then many movies! Finally we¡¦ve got a proper western game without any clich_s and yet with all ingredients a right western must have. [Issue#192]
2010,Red Dead Redemption,Perhaps the best western-themed game yet. Red Dead Redemption is ambitious but it gets all the important details just right.

2010,Red Dead Redemption,"If you like the idea of a sandbox western then this is money well spent. In what other game can you earn a ¡¥dastardly¡¦ achievement by saving a damsel in distress, then putting her on the rail road tracks to meet her fate?"
