2010,Red Dead Redemption,"Much, much better than GTA 4.  Before anybody bashes me with this phrase, hear me out - it is simply a better game, it has that class and charm that I feel was lost after the GTA games on PS2.

Before anybody bashes me with this phrase, hear me out - it is simply a better game, it has that class and charm that I feel was lost after the GTA games on PS2.  The graphics are very clean, the landscapes are fantastic (particularly at sunrise/sunset), a part of you feels like you're back in a classic Spaghetti Western when you play this, it's very authentic looking.  The controls don't have a steep learning curve, the music is well done, even though I think this was the game's main weakness (I would have brought in Ennio Morricone for it), the characters are full of life (and if you have friends similar to Irish, it makes it all the more amusing), the side missions are mixed in difficulty and can happen anytime you're out on your horse or for a walk.  Pure and simply, if you're interested in American History, Movies about the wild west, Graphic Novels about the wild west, dressing up like a Cowboy to a rodeo show, playing the hero or the antagonist, travelling around the south western USA and mexico, and have a 360 or PS3 available - this is a game that deserves a good look!\"
2010,Red Dead Redemption,"Red Dead Redemption is a solid Wild West Themed Sandbox game. The games structure is very similar to Rockstars other Sandbox game series, the Grand Theft Auto series in which RDR places John Marston (the person you play as) into a huge Wild West Sandbox environment and complete missions, earn cash and shoot your foes.

The games structure is very similar to Rockstars other Sandbox game series, the Grand Theft Auto series in which RDR places John Marston (the person you play as) into a huge Wild West Sandbox environment and complete missions, earn cash and shoot your foes. The landscape and views look authentic and has a certain naturalness feel to it with loads of plants and live animals. The story is good, deep, fascinating and provides a good, meaty single player experience. The game (for the most part) plays like a first person shooter. Many missions see you fighting against the bad guys in engaging fire fights and RDR has a neat cover system along with a great slow-mo precision targeting system feature known as Dead-Eye which allows you to slow down time and target multiple targets then unleash hell on them with fire power. The gunplay and the game play itself is polished and uncomplicated to play due to clear instructions on where to go and an auto targeting system which allows you to quickly dispatch a group of outlaws. There are some decent variety in the missions that you'll undertake like escorting someone to safety by defending them against outlaws, tame horses, herd cattle from one place to another and more. There is a hint of RPG style game play in this game. I like the fact that you can earn money by scavenging for materials from plants or organs from dead animals and sell them to someone. The single player campaign is defiantly action heavy and bloody. The weapons at your disposal are plentiful and fun to use with bolt action rifles, pistols and a really cool lasso which can be used to take down criminals or targets without killing them. The most ideal mode of transport across the vast environment is the horse. Horse controls maybe a little bit fiddly at first but you'll get use to them. However, galloping sections where you are just riding with a NPC and discussing about various topics can get repetitious at times and I hate the fact that you have to hold down the X button to keep galloping at a consistent speed or else you'll slow down. What I like about this game is how Rockstar San Diego has captured the perception of the Wild West beautifully with the landscape, music, building design, sound design, and the character models and how they move and talk. Speaking of the sound design, the characters in this game are well voiced and the gun noises sound wonderful. What is always a strong point in Rockstar's sandbox games such as their Grand Theft Auto games is that there is an abundance of stuff to do. This game is no exception. There's loads to do even after completing the expansive single player campaign such as side jobs like being a Night Watchmen or helping civilians, scavenge for plant material and play mini games such as Horseshoes and Poker which are fun if a little annoying (especially Horse Shoes, can't say the same thing about Poker: I don't know how to play it!). The physics look convincing and realistic like falling off a cliff or dragging someone behind you (attached to the lasso) and watching them tumble and twirl while you gallop along with your horse. The game does get a little bit slow at the end and I don't like hunting helpless, innocent animals and skinning them but I guess it's just a game. When you skin animals, blood splatters across the screen which is an unnecessarily effect considering the perspective that you play the game. It would be acceptable in a first person shooter where you look through the eyes of your character but not in a third person shooter. RDR is accessible to anyone due to a generous checkpoint system and clear instructions on what to do but in turn it does make the game a little too easy. As a whole, RDR is a great Third Person Shooter with RPG elements that do not overcomplicate things. This Wild West game deserves to be in any action gamer's collection.\"

The controls feel natural but at some points the game lacks some drama and becomes a bit repetitive.The graphics are quite good, but on the exception of the landscapes which are amazing, they are inferior to Uncharted 2 or Metal Gear guns of the patriots.The only thing that I really hated about this game was the ALIASING. It seems the game is not rendered at 720p or 1080p, but at some other inferior resolution which makes a constant annoying ALIASING...Although it has it's flaws, RDR is an amazing game.\"

With enough missions and side quests to keep you busy for hours-upon-hours, a world where every inch begs to be explored, and a cast of memorable characters who follow an engaging, adrenaline-fueled plot, this game is simply put, phenomenal. Red Dead Redemption is a shining example of how to make a western game, and one no fan of the genre should miss. If your not convinced to buy the game yet, apparently you have yet to drag a helpless civilian by the feet behind your horse as you ride off into the sunset.\"

2010,Red Dead Redemption,"This game is a sigh that even games like GTA IV are now a thing of the past. Rockstar delivered a masterpiece that is worthy of GOTY for 2010. Plus, one of the best endings in recent gaming history!"

The only thing I can bash on is that it's still the standard (in the main quest) go from ""point A to point B"" thing. There is no real choice on how to do a mission which feels very linear to the rest of the game. But anyhow, it's one of the best games ever and it's definatley Rockstars best game. Love it.\"
2010,Red Dead Redemption,"This is not only the best game I have ever played; I think it belongs in a new class.  Nothing else has come close.  It is the most immersive open world experience out there.  The graphics are stunning graphics, the voice acting excellent, and the sheer number of interesting activities is mind-boggling.  This is not simply GTA with horses, it is a significant leap ahead."
2010,Red Dead Redemption,"Dull. This is the best word for this game. Sorry, but I am not interested in skinning racoons, or riding MILES across plains to get to the next shootout. Yes, beautiful, atmospheric, clever, well made. But dull."
2010,Red Dead Redemption,"Never was a fan of GTA series but a big fan of Westerns. So I was intrigued at the concept of a sandbox game mixed with a Western background. The result was one of the best gaming experiences ever. The storyline is greatly influenced by classic Western movies like The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. Plus, the soundtrack is one of most memorable pieces of music I've had the pleasure of listening to."
2010,Red Dead Redemption,"So, this is one of the best games I've ever played, hands down. It's not the grudgingly good score some give games that are rated well but not quite as enjoyable as expected, nor is it one that I am fanboyish about because I just happened to be in the perfect mood for it one sleepless night. Those games, and we all know there are plenty of examples of each, all have something to improveSo, this is one of the best games I've ever played, hands down. It's not the grudgingly good score some give games that are rated well but not quite as enjoyable as expected, nor is it one that I am fanboyish about because I just happened to be in the perfect mood for it one sleepless night. Those games, and we all know there are plenty of examples of each, all have something to improve on. Yet RDR has nothing to improve on, it simply gives us a living, breathing world, and lets us romp around in it like the heroes of westerns would have, but with the self-conscious modernist philosophical twist Rockstar showed more crudely in GTA. The societal commentary is there, but more intelligent and not as nihilistic or snarky as in GTA. Much more consistent message and world all around here.So, the GTA formula is inevitably what this game will be compared to by anyone who ever played Rockstar's stuff since GTA 3. And it's a fair comparison because it's superficially just like GTA, but, unlike GTA, it is quite refined in action. There is no tedious travel because you can quick travel with a minimum amount of downtime, yet you can appreciate the landscape if you wish by just riding toward the sun and seeing where it leads you (try it at sunset, it's pretty and it's fun).The GTA formula could not, IMHO, get much more refined than this, because not only is it convenient, but it encourages you to explore and has a TON of stuff for anyone who wants to go outside the storyline and play around. There are 10 ranks in 4 different categories of various tasks, in hunting, shooting, picking herbs, and treasure hunting. I love all these activites, and it's fun to work on them because they feel so natural in conjunction with running around across the landscape.So rather than rehash what you can read in dozens of professional reviews, I guess I want to say, to clear away all the informational overload, how I react to this game overall, and how it fits into the landscape of gaming these days. This game is more like Oblivion than any other, I believe, because its best character is the world in which everything takes place. Except unlike Oblivion, its polish, detail, and mind-boggling variety will even impress the most pissy, jaded critics. The world has a personality of its own, and there are two basic themes that shine through this entire experience - a rustic nostalgia we all love from the best 50's westerns, and also the kind of serious humanistic character-driven drama we get from the best modern cinema. There are plenty of examples of both in this game, which is one of the biggest reasons that it succeeds so well, that it does not simply flip the bird to everyone the way Grand Theft Auto did. There is depth and maturity in, not only the story, but the whole world and style. This, folks, is a video game world if there ever was one, not just a haphazard collection of missions - so get it already if you have a PS3 or 360 and if you love quality games. And, on a side note, if jaggies bother you in your games you will have to get used to them, especially for the PS3 version, which has quite a bit of aliasing that distorts the otherwise beautiful landscape. Odd since the PS3 is so much more powerful with exclusives. As a PC gamer I am especially picky about graphics, but even compared to many other PS3 games the jaggies are pretty noticeable, and I heard the 360 version's graphics are smoother.To close, I did read about the exploitation of the Rockstar SD employees by executives, and I think it's a travesty - if someday a Rockstar SD employee might read this review, the silent majority of gamers wish you could've been given an extra year to make this game if that meant you could've worked a reasonable work week. To think that the few hundred men and women who made one of the greatest games of our generation had to worry about their labor rights being upheld is simply ridiculous. But in the end we all appreciate your blood, sweat, and tears, and we hope you continue to do more fantastic work in the future. The game speaks for itself.\"
2010,Red Dead Redemption,"I don't think I've ever grown to care so much about a character as I did with John Marston. The story is so well crafted and every character feels so believable.

An incredible cowboy simulator, I really really got into the western feeling. Riding is incredible and missions are great! This is the first gime where I really cared about doing everything 100% because I couldn't stop playing it. Also, when the game was over I felt sad for days - I'm not kidding. There was such a big emptiness and I wish I could erase my memory and play it from the beginning. Truly a masterpiece in gaming, much better than GTA IV.\"

The gameplay is very similar to Grand Theft Auto 4, however the game adds a few little tweaks and touches to set it apart, most notably the cover system has been heavily immproved as has the shooting, platforming also has a slight emphasis in the game which can be slightly irritating due to Marston's occasionally sluggish movement, however as it isn't brought up often it can be forgiven. Horses take over from the cars of GTA and are a welcome improvement, easy to control and after a few minutes of riding around in the Wild West you'll be shooting from horseback like a true outlaw. Missions vary, with some asking you to assist a rebellion and another (delightful) mission letting you rob a train. However many levels, such as the train level, that offer interesting elements are brushed over and do not reappear, which can be slightly disappointing. The graphics are phenomenal. The deserts, plains and settlements of RDR look beautiful, and the animals and characters populating them are equally impressive. Thanks to the brilliant engine behind the game's physics, NPCs react incredibly realistically to being shot or falling. A shot to the shoulder, for example, will throw back the character, shoulder first whereas a shot to the leg will topple them, leaving them to limp away. The gritty, dark streets of Liberty City have been replaced by the Old Western states of West Elizabeth, New Austin and Nuevo Paraiso, allowing you to trek through Mexico as well as North America. All three locations offer varying terrain, environments, people and wildlife, for example West Elizabeth, the northernmost location offers dense, snowy forests populated by bears and deer as well as a large town full of posh citizens, whereas down south in Nuevo Paraiso, the land is covered with deserts and canyons as well as lower class villages, and Bobcats. The weapons are fun to use and get better as you progress through the story, the downloadable Explosive Rifle being a highlight. The multiplayer is also enjoyable and incredibly satisfying to succeed in. When you first hit the square button you'll be thrown into a free-roam session in which you can roam around performing challenges, breaking the law or just wandering. Alternatively, once dropped into free roam you can open the multiplayer menu by pressing the SELECT button and choose from several game-types (added to with DLC), these generally consist of Teamdeath Match, Deathmatch, and an interesting mode called ""grab the bag"", it's essentially capture the flag but with a slight twist, the bag weighs a little and slows your character down, you're also limited to a handgun when carrying the bag so it's helpful to ask your teammates for aid at that point, however this game mode can also be played without teams, allowing you to pick up multiple bags and eventually break your shoulders (that was a joke). Another interesting dynamic to multiplayer is that most of the matches begin with a classic Mexican standoff, in the case of team games both teams stand opposite each other and in free-for-all games, players stand in a circle. The seconds leading up to these standoffs are intense and the standoff itself is very satisfying to win. The team that succeeds in the standoff is given a head start, also.Overall the game is excellent, yes it's held back by a few minor flaws but they're hardly game breakers. If you have a PS3 (or an XBOX for that matter) you should buy this game, perhaps buy the GOTY addition as that includes all of the brilliant DLC packs (Undead Nightmare is unbelievably good) and isn't much more expensive.\"
2010,Red Dead Redemption,"This game is beautiful. The vast landscape, the bustling western towns, the dynamic characters, this game is one of the greatest of this gen. Good job, Rockstar."
2010,Red Dead Redemption,"As far as games go, it doesn't get much better than this one. The graphics are, at times, strikingly beautiful. The game is also unbelievably well written and acted, there were a couple times during this game which almost made me tear up. Gripping, intelligent, and fierce. A great game all around. Oh, yeah, and it's fun as **** to play."
2010,Red Dead Redemption,Great game. Main story is linear but pretty long and interesting. It remainds me movies like Unforgiven. There is large world with a lot of things to do and plenty of side task/quests. If you like TPP action games you have to play it.
2010,Red Dead Redemption,"A great, great game! RDR takes you to the western world with perfection. John Marston is one of the best characters ever in video games history. Open world, tons of missions, great gameplay, awesome graphics and a soundtrack that makes the experience more immersive! if you have a PS3 or a XBOX360, go and buy this masterpiece! RDR is one of the 3 favorite games of all time (for me)."
2010,Red Dead Redemption,"Unquestionably one of the best games ever made, nothing combines action, story-telling with an old-west feel like RDR. People may say that GTA 4 is better than RDR, but Niko is just some petty criminal, whereas Marston is fighting for a just cause."
2010,Red Dead Redemption,"The game is nice for a 3rd person shooter. The game allows you to free roam with some interesting finds to give you some side quest as sharp shooter, gatherer, etc. The main story is nice to follow with an end that I didn't predict. To play a GTA game settled in the west was a nice change."
2010,Red Dead Redemption,"Very well thought out game, has a great story line all the way to the end, enough different weapons to make it interesting, i personally prefer the GTA games however this was definitely worth buying. I enjoyed it to the very end."
2010,Red Dead Redemption,"By now you probably know all about Red Dead Redemption. It had a harsh development life at Rockstar, it won all the awards and it's ""awesome."" But you haven't bought it yet - so you're probably wondering if it's for you. Here's some perspective. If you felt disappointed, bored or simply satisfied and done with the last GTA than you probably won't find much to love with Red Dead Redemption.By now you probably know all about Red Dead Redemption. It had a harsh development life at Rockstar, it won all the awards and it's ""awesome."" But you haven't bought it yet - so you're probably wondering if it's for you. Here's some perspective. If you felt disappointed, bored or simply satisfied and done with the last GTA than you probably won't find much to love with Red Dead Redemption. No, it's not fair to call RDR simply GTA on a horse but it does play much like it. There is an interesting story here, the world feels alive and is gorgeous, there's plenty to do but in the end the game plays very similar to GTA. That is a good or bad thing. Additionally while the overall story is interesting and engrossing it takes its time to progress. It started, something happens at the 4ish hour mark and another thing happens at the 8-9 hour mark. Nothing is happening in between. Nothing. So what goes on there? Favor quests. Do you know those sidequests games throw in with strangers asking you for a favor? Yeah, most of RDR's main quests are just like that. You'll meet someone, they'll tell you to do something and you'll need to do it. The main character will begin commenting on how ridiculous this is in the 6th or 7th hour of this constant favor quests which doesn't make it ok. It feels lazy. ""I'll help you if you do this...now this...great! Now let's do this! Ok. I have a friend. Go see them and do this and they'll help you. I have to go and can't."" Get used to that. For all there is to do in RDR I've been focusing on the main missions simply because they already feel like side missions so I have no desire to do extra favors for extra goodies on the side and the game is pretty long which is good (10th hour right now) but they could have made the missions more story or main character oriented. The combat is good, this is a great shooter at it's core. You can also use a bullet-time system to mark enemies and do quick executions. You can fight on your horse. You'll lasso and tie enemies from afar. Occasionally you'll make important decisions. You'll enjoy horse riding from mission to mission although there comes a point where it takes too long and gets a bit old, so you'll probably switch to the instant travel option in the menu. There are some fun games to play, old movie shorts to watch, and some system to buy property for money but you'll never need it. I've never needed to worry about money, buy health or buy a weapon...but if you want to it's there. There's multiplayer in here too but it feels as unpolished and fun as GTA's multiplayer - so can decide on that for yourself. So is Red Dead Redemption for you? This is a game worthy of it's hype. The story is good, the voice acting is even better, the graphics are usually gorgeous and the gameplay is topnotch. It appeals to a mass audience and is a better package than most games last year. Is it worthy of the hype? Yes and no, for reasons I've noted. If you're interested in cowboys, love GTA or want a deeper action experience then give it a try. If you don't like games with a ton of excess fat that is labeled as ""depth"" or if you've had enough of the GTA sandbox-littered-with-favor-missions setup than you will not find much to enjoy here. While it is a better overall package than most games last year I'd have to give it an 8/10 at most due to some lazy structuring, extremely slow pacing and poorly implemented mechanics.\"

The gta series is recycled and other sandbox franchises try to imitate it. Red dead, although from the same developer, is nothing like that and is in fact the best sandbox game I have ever played. There arent many western videogames around so red dead redemption comes out as a very unique game. The gameplay in RDR is varied and goes from the regular shooting/escorting missions to sidequests and mini games. The side quests, though usually not related to the main story, are very good and interesting. There are tons of mini games of all sorts( poker, horseshoe etc.) and they are fun. The game really gets incredible with the story mission. the story is a bit similar to that in gta 4 but more subtle. John Marston is a badass but is very human( unlike Niko). You really bond with the characters so you really want to know how everything turns out in the end. The game is incredible in the sound and graphics compartments as well. The graphics are probably the best in sandbox games history and the sound fits perfectly to the game. You really feel like you are in the wild west and exploring the huge map is great. There is also multiplayer, which I didn't really like but others do, if you are intrested in that. The game has quite a few glitches and sometimes they are annoying but they are far far from being a deal breaker. Overall the game is superb. It takes an overused genre and turns it unique back again. As a whole package this game is everything you could hope for in an action game: fun and unique gameplay, great story, good sound, incredible visuals and a ton of replay value. One of my favourites this gen for sure.\"

Rockstar have done wonders with this game. GTA4 wasn't as bad as everyone makes it but a big problem I felt was the reptitive nature within the game and this was one thing that Rockstar seems to have addressed. The missions give you a big variety which is always helpful. Then there are the side-stories which once again offers you something totally different from the main storyline combine that with the alternatives of skinning wild animals, playing poker, bounty hunting, duels RDR can't be accused of lacking in terms of gameplay. As John Marston you are torn away from your family and told to find and kill one of his old friends Bill Williamson, initially the game is slow and lets you get used to everything but once you get going, if you stick with it, RDR is very engrossing. Visually it depcits the Wild West superbly. Its not jaw-dropping as such but its still impressive the detail and natural feeling that Rockstat managed to bring to the table. Multiplayer gives you the usual free-for-all with up to 16 players and theres team matches but the best part comes with the Zombie Undead DLC a genius idea that you can never go wrong with it is awesome! All in all RDR is a great game, nobody can dispute that but its a game thats a hit or a miss. Some people will love it and some will hit hate. If you stick with it it is a rewarding experience but at times it can be boring and the game is let down by quite a weak ending.\"
2010,Red Dead Redemption,"Completed this game just today. A magnificent game that improves over GTA 4 in every possible way. The graphics look more detailed, the gameplay is better and there are far more weapons to be messing about with. My only complaint is that the ending was rushed and I was let down due to the fact that the game felt much shorter than GTA 4."
2010,Red Dead Redemption,"Recently, I'm playing the PS3 version for one of the best games from these generations and what I can say it's that, I didn't find any problem at all in the single-player (glitches , technical problems , or playability difficulties ) . In simple words, Red Dead Redemption is another master piece brought to you by the folks from Rockstar , without a doubt is a definitive tittle to your library."
2010,Red Dead Redemption,"Take Grand Theft Auto, transport the concept to the old west, swap the cars for horses, the handguns for pistols and safe houses to saloons and you find yourself immersed in Red Dead Redemption.

Despite the sarcastic tone of my opening line I say immersed because it is grand and vast although this can be a bad thing with huge ground having to be covered by horseback at times.Overall though Rockstar have to be commended for what is an excellent but flawed game with a good, if predictable, storyline and some good character development. Kudos for the unusual ending (although maybe not so unusual in the old West) which came as a surprise and I cannot say that has happened too often in my gaming life. Roll on the inevitable RDR2, not the Undead pack, but a real sequel.\"

Yes there are amazing gun blazing moments like RockStar always delivers, but the story is where its at in this game. Now I love to shoot a barman as much as the next guy, but people (while looking through the reviews here) must have expected another GTA 4. This is not GTA, this is better in my personal opinion. I had no problems with this game, maybe a little slow to get the story going, but I love the huge open world, with animals to hunt and bandits to shoot in the face. The multiplayer however is by far the best part, multiplayer free roam is just a blast! Going into possies with your friends and hunting outlaws (or being outlaws) is an exhilarating experience that should be in more games. Overall, I can expect to keep coming back to Red Dead Redemption.\"

RDR is one of the greatest videogame experiences because it successfully gathers a well told story, beautiful scenarios, outstanding characters (both major and supporting roles) and the greatest gameplay mechanics and missions compilation from the whole Rockstar's library. It is true that at first I got a little disapointed with the empty world when compared to GTA IV, but on the other hand, traveling from place to place reminded me of how much GTA San Andreas was awesome. If GTA IV impressed me with a higher maturity level than all the previous titles from the series, this subject takes a step further on RDR, as a one of kind plot on its debate about morality and consequences of your action. Plus, a very enjoyable multiplayer content comes with the pack. Not to say that this game is perfect, the final missions are very anticlimactic compared to the rest of the story, but the final mission and the ending makes this bad experienced to be quickly erased from your memory. In the end, you have a one of a kind opportunity to join John Marston on his journey to save everything left that matters to him, and learn from a tragically beautiful perspective that the scars from his past are deeper than the ones in his face, and to comprehend that the good and the bad relies on single actions and gestures of individuals, because people don't simply change, but the cirscunstances always do.\"

The environment is beautifully rendered through the graphics, sound effects, and music that make the world a pleasure to live out a legend in. You can marvel at just going to the menu and seeing the freeze frame create a beautiful tableau. RDR has pacing that can be at times exciting and other times relaxing, encouraging the player to take time enjoying the wildlife (even while hunting it).

THIS IS NOT GTA, OR BASED IN THE GTA UNIVERSE. Some people jump into the game and start shooting everything then getting the sheriffs on them, then die, then repeat until it gets boring instead of follow the story. And what a story it is, its kind of split into three sections: wild west america, mexico and then modern mountainous america (all one map) Its basicallyy a trilogy. However the mexican part of the game bored me a bit and whilst having it's good moments you inevitably compare it the the first ""film"" which is the best. Theres a huge cast in the game which creates some memorable characters indivual to each section however there is some crossovers which are nice to see. The storys great and so is the gameplay which plays like a third person cover based shooter, and with the ability use every gun in the game (after you buy, get given or find them) means you can constantly adapt. Dead eye (slows down time and allows you to target partes of the body) works well and its impresive that if you shoot someone in the leg they react to it and can literally be brought to their knees. The single player can last a while with quite a few side missions which are more like side storys which add to the overall length and imersion. then theres the multiplayer which is on par with the single, everything you do helps you level up and the free roam is full of mini missions you and your posse can do, there are also a string of competitive games to play which work well and are good fun and never seem to get old so like me you can pour hours and hours into the online without it feeling repetitive or boring. There are a few glitches but they don't ruining the experience and the graphics which aren't mind blowing still look good and are enough to keep you imersed. I feel I should talk about the lighting which is spectacular and very realistic, everyting has a shadow and the game looks amazing when theres lightning happening. Everyone needs this game its so deep and John Marston is one of the best game characters rockstar could have chosen to play lead man, his voice acting is top notch and you really beging to care about him and his struggles. Its simply the best game ever and deserves everyones attention.\"
2010,Red Dead Redemption,My one saving grace on the ps3 right now.  Its the only game that is actually working well for me on the p3 right now.  Its a hoot to play although a bit graphic in places and certainly something that you don't want your kids in the same room while your playing!
2010,Red Dead Redemption,"I think it is the best PS3 game I ever played. The only bad thing I found is that the beginning and the ending are boring compared to the action of the middle of the game. But this is a really good game, with an excellent soundtrack, an excellent scenario, an excellent gameplay, an excellent map, sublime landscapes, long life expectancy (+ multiplayer)."

I have played some amazing games with great gameplay, story and a fantastic universe, but I have never played a game as good as this. I only picked this up at the start of this year, and I really regret waiting so long to do so. Red Dead Redemption is Rockstar's masterpiece. It blends a fantastic story, great gameplay and an incredibly immersive, gorgeous world that really feels like a living world. I'll start by talking about the graphics. The graphics are absolutely breath-taking. Two years after its release and Red Dead is still one of the best looking games I have ever played. The wild west looks fantastic and diverse and has a gigantic scope. I have never really been compelled to explore any open world games- GTA4 didn't really have an interesting world, in Skyrim I just spammed the fast travel and in many other open world games I just only focused on the story. However in Red Dead Redemption the world is so beautiful that simply riding my horse around the Wild West is enough to keep me incredibly entertained. Now I will talk about the story. The story seems like a simple western but it is still fantastic. It is the story of a man called John Marston. At the beginning John gets shot and left to die by former gang mate Bill Williamson. He is taken in by a woman named Bonnie MacFarlane who tends to his wounds and lets him stay at her ranch. Marston then goes on a journey to try and find Bill Williamson and kill him before he kills his family. It's an interesting story filled with some whacky, interesting and compelling characters. There wasn't a single character (with the exception of Nigel West Dickens) who annoyed me.  The gameplay was just fantastic. The main weapons I used were a rifle, shotgun, knife, pistol and a lasso. All of them look good and feel powerful, because every bullet of a gun that hits an enemy, every victim you throw your lasso at reacts well and realistically, a shot to the leg won't necessarily kill, whereas a shot to the chest or head can kill instantly. The horse riding is a bit wonky at first, however you get used to it after a while and you wouldn't have the horse riding controls any other way. There are a lot of activities to do in Red Dead. From cattle herding, horse breaking, assaulting gang hideouts, playing poker, liar's dice and blackjack, hunting and more. There are also treasures to find and a lot of cool costumes to unlock, with the Mexican poncho being the highlight of all the costumes. There are just so many things to do in the massive world of Red Dead Redemption and you'll never feel bored of what you are doing. The bottom line is that Red Dead Redemption is an absolute masterpiece. It blends a fantastic open world, a great story, fantastic gameplay and charming characters. Red Dead Redemption is single handedly the best game I have ever played. Rockstar are simply the master game creators, and I cannot wait to see what is next for the Read Dead series. You absolutely have to buy this game, your money will be well spent and you will enjoy it for hours, even if you aren't a fan of western movies.\"

The dialogues, the picking of the words and the conversation itself were mastered, in this game. It's really hilarious sometimes, as as well dramatic and deep other times. Plus, the voice acting is perfect, just how every game should be (in special, the voice of John Marston, the protagonist, is badass and awesome as hell). Story-wise, RDR has a decent story. It's not the best story out there, but it really gets the job done. The details in the world around helps to build an atmosphere that truly makes you feel as if you're in a Western world.The graphics are amazing. The world is beatiful. It's wonderful to literally ride to the sunset, or at dawn. The character models are not the best in the market. In one hand, facial animations are a bit poor, but nothing too much terrible to complain; in other, the body animations are very good and make the game look good.The gameplay is easy to get: point the dot and shoot. The good stuff here lies in the dead eye system. You can slow time and mark the targets you wanna shoot. When you press the trigger, everything you marked goes to the ground. It makes you look like a **** badass cowboy. The gun duels are amusing, too. But be advised: you can lose many hours in the game just playing card games, such as blackjack or poker. There are also games such liar's dice and horseshoes, In the end, all of them are pretty fun. RDR features side quests and outfits-hunting for the most adventurous players.Red Dead Redemption is an epic Western game that will suck you in with the roughness and glory of a rich world, fun gameplay and good story. It's just Rockstar being awesome again.\"

2010,Call of Duty: Black Ops,"I'm a little disappointed that the Call of Duty franchise has hit a point in the series' history where any subpar developer can slap the words ""Call of Duty"" on the front cover and it will become the most successful selling game of all time. Yes, Black Ops is still an excellent game, but I'm giving it a 6 because the game had a ridiculous amount of hype and yet, it delivered absolutelyI'm a little disappointed that the Call of Duty franchise has hit a point in the series' history where any subpar developer can slap the words ""Call of Duty"" on the front cover and it will become the most successful selling game of all time. Yes, Black Ops is still an excellent game, but I'm giving it a 6 because the game had a ridiculous amount of hype and yet, it delivered absolutely nothing new or inspiring to the table. As another user critic said, the game is doing nothing except receive a piggy back ride from Modern Warfare 2. If Black Ops and Modern Warfare 2 switched release dates, MW2 would be the best selling game of all time. You could not tell the difference between which game was released first. The only reason that Black Ops is as successful as it is, is because of one reason: it is more new. I am not exaggerating this when I say it. It is not superior in any way, but rather actually a degrade in many aspects. To start, the graphics are literally the exact same. And in some cases, it somehow manages to be worse. I have absolutely no idea how, and I still have don't have an answer to this day, other than the engine is worse the MW2's. On the topic, since the engine is different, the entire feel of the game isn't as smooth as MW2 feels. I can't describe it too well, it just feels clunkier, and the hit detection is worse. The single player is very good, despite having another extremely short campaign. You can complete the campaign on Normal difficulty in probably 3 hours tops, so if you don't have online, I highly urge you to not buy this game. The storyline of the campaign is very original in my opinion, and the ending was very well-written. Despite this, it was a little anti-climatic, as I'm used to a pulsating thrill-ride the last ten minutes of a standard Call of Duty campaign. Voice-acting was extremely well-done, and there's some recognizable names behind the acting such as Ice Cube that really deliver an astounding performance. Some of the missions are a little cliche, a mere, ""Been there, done that"" feeling that you have already experienced this in other installments. Moving on to multiplayer, this is where I feel that I was disappointed the most. Sure, Black Ops has their original Nazi Zombies, but let's be honest, would you really pay $60 for just that? It's fun for awhile, but not enough to warrant a purchase alone. The multiplayer maps online are merely a host of mediocre maps that are nothing memorable. They involve a lot of camping spots and chokepoints that enemy players are constantly hovering around. Also, because so many of them are not as largescale as MW2's maps, sniping essentially goes out the window. On the topic of snipers, they themselves are worthless weapons in comparison to any assault rifle, and it is not uncommon to be called a noob for using one. The weapons are unbalanced, and everyone uses either the FAMAS or the AK74u, which is to be expected, since both of these guns are far superior to the others. The sound quality has actually become worse than on MW2, and the killstreaks available to you are boring or borrowed from MW2. One example is the Chopper Gunner; sound familiar? Amidst this darkness are some great new addions, however, such as the ability to customize your own personal emblem. Also, the addition of contracts is a rather cool idea, and some new game modes such as One in the Chamber are a blast to play. Overall, there are some great additions to Black Ops, but they don't add up to much. And they certainly don't add up to an entire purchase of a brand new game that feels, looks, and plays like MW2. If you have your copy of MW2 stlll, it would be best if you stuck with that. If not, I guess Black Ops would be a worthy purchase since that's what everyone else plays.\"

Really no moments that are visually stunning. Given that somehow they've managed to make it run less efficiently. During my setup for single player graphics i experienced instense lag, my screen would flash yellow and i had to lower the settings down on AA AASA. At this point the game still had moments of extreme choppiness though i could play with the settings further because of the poorly done menu. Every mutliplayer game i've joined has people lagging out or crashing because of graphical issues. I run a Nvidia 480GTX, Quad-core Intel, 8GB of ram and I STILL get lag in this game (yes i have the latest drivers). The game play is the roughly the same as the first but it feels less fluid, the AI does nothing but get in the way the entire time, you basically feel like your just running through a movie and only you down know the script. You end up having to kill everything you see as your AI squad members really dont do anything except follow their scripts. In this game they've simply reused what they had and spent even less time on making it feel ""epic"" and even less time on the menu system of the game which at this point its so PC unfriendly that it makes me want to cry.The list of complaints tends to drag on but over all the fact that this was a $59.99 for an even shorter game than the first, using the same engine, same everything is really just criminal. I regret spending my $60 for something that should have been in the $30 price range as an expansion.To  the Critic's that have reviewed this. Did you even play Modern Warfare 2? How can people even suggest that this ""tops"" that? You had to crawl through a trench under heavy machine gun fire in front of the WHITE HOUSE in the first one, nuclear war, defending the homeland they managed to hit every button to get people to connect with their game. The story of this game is a giant flash back, that has nothing to do with us, and lets just say the ending was a joke.\"

I, personally, consider this the best game in the series. That being said, It is hard to argue this game is flawless. While the campaign is the best yet, the easier difficulties are altogether to easy. Honestly, in many cases you can simply sit back and let your bot allies take care of the enemies. The exception to this is veteran, which is extremely challenging. Unfortunately, there really is no medium difficulty for Black Ops. That being said, the campaign is fun and exciting, with a story that is surprisingly interesting for a Call of Duty game. Multiplayer wise, Black Ops is like any other Call of Duty. Addicting, but frustrating. Due to the majority of players buying Call of Duty for the multiplayer, I will review this section extensively. To begin, the multiplayer, like any other CoD, is fast-paced and frantic. Even though Treyarch increased the amount of damage you take, you still die quickly and you will not find yourself getting away from gunfights in most scenarios. In addition, the guns in Black Ops are disappointing. If you are trying to do well, the assault rifles are vastly superior to all other gun's, save the AK74u. That being said, in and of themselves, the assault rifles are balanced and each fun to use in their own way. Additionally, the sub machine guns, shotguns, and Light Machine Gun's are all balanced and unique, if not for the Assault Rifles outshining them in most situations. Finally, the Sniper Rifles are, sadly, useless in this game, and you will not be able to quickscope like previous Call of Duty's. While this may come to a relief to some, because Treyarch made only a couple sniper-friendly maps, the Sniper is a gun that could have easily been left out without being missed. Customization wise,Treyarch brings many new attachments, camos, perks, and kill streaks. Although some could argue kill streaks underpowered, all in all the customization is balanced and, depending on the different load outs you go with, the game can feel very different. Unlike previous Call of Duty games, the grenade launcher has a very reasonable blast radius and, when against Flak Jacket (A perk that gives you extra explosive resistance) its overall useless.  On the gameplay aspect, the map's are fun and interesting, the gameplay is fluid, the control's flawless, and the graphics passable. Unfortunately, the spawns could use some tweaking. Depending on the game mode you play, you can easily be trapped in your spawn or, on the opposite side of things, switch spawns to easily and spawn behind enemies, or vise-versa. Additionally, the matchmaking is not ideal. In many cases, when playng with parties, you will get into a game with a few people missing. This never happened in previous call of duties and, even worse, you could get into a game that is already, in essence, a loss. Finally, I will address the zombie mode. Zombie's is arguably the best part of Black Ops. There is something altogether to satisfying by annihilating endless zombie hordes with a couple of friends. On the later rounds, it takes a lot of teamwork to survive. Black Ops comes with 2 map's, Kino der Toten and Five. Although Five is not as enjoyable for me, Kino der Toten is extremely fun and pack's hours of play. In addition, if you purchased the Hardened addition to Black Ops, you will gain access to the 4 zombie maps from WaW with modern weapons. While all fun, my personal favorite is Der Reise. Finally, if you purchase the fifteen dollar map pack you will gain the ability to play Ascension, my favorite zombie map. Ascension is surprisingly complicated for a zombie map, even coming with a side-objective to try if your feeling lucky. Unfortunately, its not easy and you'll need a full party of four. In the end, Black Ops is a very fun game that deserves your purchase, especially if you enjoyed the previous call of duties. Although the Multiplayer will surely attract most, be sure not to overlook Zombies and the Campaign. My only caution is that multiplayer, even the campaign in some parts, will be frustrating. However, if this happens just take a break and come back later. My final thoughts, great purchase, but if your not a fan of shooters I would let this one pass.\"

The game is called black ops but it never really felt like Black ops. Theres still a ways to go before Call of Duty will get character development right, and a truly engulfed story line.That being said, I do think that the multiplayer experience is a improvement. The perks are more even, the maps are better with numerous entry ways into every building, customization is great, stats/leaderboards are well thought out, and the new free for all game modes are fun (but you cannot gain xp, only cod points).As for Zombies I could'nt be bothered, I miss the spec ops, which was my favorite feature for Modern Warfare 2.

Thank you Treyarch.\"

Unfortunately, it doesn't add a great deal of fresh concepts. The singleplayer was one of the best Call of Duty campaigns to date with a very different style tot he other campaigns and this also makes it stand out. Unfortunately, it isn't as good as Call of Duty 4 in my opinion, which, in it's prime, was unbeatable and definitely my most enjoyable Call of Duty experience, although maybe that's just the series not pushing the boundaries very far.

The story was amazing and unexpected, and kept you interested throughout.  Graphics were good (if a little outdated on the engines part), and mechanics were just as good as they've ever been.Online is a bit of a different story.  I think the core online multiplayer deserves no more than a 1/2.5, because of severe synchronization problems.  You can fire off an entire clip at an enemy and he will kill you with a single shot.  When you look at it again in theatre, you aren't shown to be firing a shot.  This shows that you are lagging behind the actual game time, and it can be a severe impediment in head to head battles.  Sometimes, it works in your favor, but it's too big a factor to ignore.Zombies is definitely a huge redeeming feature of this game, and for that it gets 2.5/2.5. One of the best 'swarm' style games I've played, and the innate black humour just makes it better.  Weapons are amazing and the actual 'stories' behind the maps are engaging and sometimes downright hilarious.My totals add up to an 8.5/10.  Since metacritic only allows full number value ratings, I downgraded it to an 8, because I can't see a game with such an average multiplayer (main feature) being a 9/10.\"

While Infinity Ward gives us Modern Warfare, Treyarch just sticks with a World At War. While Inifinity Ward decides to stomp on innovation, Treyarch experiments with new things- not always to success, but who blames them? With Black Ops, fans finally accepted Treyarch, even though they still stuck to the past. The thing is, they crawled out of their muddy trench to deliver an intense Cold war thriller that doesn't pull any punches and also provides the right amount of innovation to propel this series for another year. Between a brilliant campaign, addictive multiplayer and the outrageously fun Zombies mode, Black Ops triumphs as the fourth best COD in the series...Let's begin with the main attraction, the multiplayer. While it certainly isn't a revolution, it is an utterly polished and infinitely replayable experience. The new modes are fast paced and fun and TDM and FFA are still excellent. Rather than sticking to my guns, I experimented with new modes for fun and found myself enjoying the game even more. The levelling and progression systems haven't innovated too much, but they are still well designed and easier to comprehend than Battlefield (before anybody screams hate at me for saying that, I am not a fanboy for either of them and believe they are as good as one another). The Create A Class and customization options are where this game really shines, where the better interfaces and menus make for a more accessible experience. The large range of perks and scorestreaks means that your experience can be incredibly different from anyone else's and there is a large amount of gear that just caters to newbies (or noobies). As for the guns- by god are they amazing! Each one feels different and the awesome amount of upgrades and levelling turns this into an RPG for weapons. You can get your weapons gold or diamond and the amount of clan options makes this mode an even more desired option. The party modes are also great, with gun game easily being the best.While all of this may be amazing, the maps are some of the best in COD history. Nuketown is an excellent setting and is an instant classic, with its bright colours and small, intense design. While there are a few too many snow maps, Firing Range is another classic and the jungle and city set maps are also great. Black Ops embraces the intense, close quarters combat of the series and this is its greatest strength.Then there are the zombies. One of the most surprising things about World At War was its unlockable Zombies mode and that returns for BLOPS, but you can play one of the maps from the start while the other two are only obtainable after completing the campaign. This is agood design decision, as this is one of the best co-op experiences in all of history. It starts off easy, but as you progress, the zombies get faster, the hordes get larger and hellhounds appear. The main map is nothing compared to BLOPSII and its Transit, but it is arguably more focused and just better. The amount of hidden secrets constantly encourages replayability and this mode has that ""just one more go"" mentality about it. It keeps the money and weapons systems and the intense difficulty and isn't a large step up form WAW, but who cares? Zombies!!!The last of the three modes in BLOPs is the campaign. While it isn't as shocking as MW2, it is just as good.  The set pieces continue to increase in size and scale, with a crossbow focused snow level, the opening sequence and the final attack being particular highlights. There are the usual collectibles and replaying the campaign isn't a bad option, but this an experience to be had just once, simply because the final twist just doesn't have the same impact the second time around.The story sees you playing as Alex Mason- a soldier who has been captured and is undergoing interrogation, due to his suspicious behaviour and potential involvement in a terrorist attack. The whole game recounts his adventures, but you will occasionally switch roles for a greater narrative base. The characters are memorable and the fairly good looking graphics engine ensures that it can all be pulled off in an incredibly realistic and atmospheric way. The Cold War backdrop is what really give this game its legs, what with it seemingly being the perfect time period for a COD game. I love this campaign and it is easily one of the best in the series.Everything about BLOPs is polished and well executed. It controls well, the performances and score are brilliant and it looks great as well- even 4 years on. The campaign, multiplayer and Zombies mode still aren't highly innovative, but who cares? This is some of the best fun in COD in years. Treyarch is better than Infinity Ward anyway...\"

I thought Call of Duty 3 was a good game, too. Accordingly, I had high expectations for Treyarch. I can't say I hate Black Ops, because I don't, I just don't LOVE it. First off, let's start with the perks - The Campaign blew me away. I thought it would be a Modern Warfare 2-style thing with a little more stealth and set in the 60`s. Hey, I wouldn't have had a problem with that, Modern Warfare 2's Campaign was great for me. Black Ops blew that out of the water... It was amazing. I'm not the most skilled player out there, Regular is about where I'm at. Every CoD game prior to this bored me at some point and just seemed too hard... Never did this happen in Black Ops. Treyarch's story is amazing, and I'd buy ""Black Ops 2"" or whatever just to see what else happens to Mason and Hudson and everyone... I actually felt attached to the characters this time. Next - Zombies. Kino Der Toten is one of the best Zombie Maps out there, better than the amazing Der Riese, which, until now, was my favorite map. Dempsy, Nikolai, Takeo and Richtofen are hilarious, and they can make an impossible situation to overcome all the brighter. Plus, I've never had so much fun slaughtering zombies as a Presidential Aid... Ever! ""Five"" is another great map in Zombies where you play as JFK, Robert McNamara, Richard Nixon and Fidel Castro as you hold off hordes of the undead in the Pentagon. How that makes any sense, I don't know. Just go with it. Split-screen System Link and XBL is also a great feature, even if it is only 2 players - my brother and I both have our own Xbox and Black Ops, so we're never short of players for a zombie match. The game's graphics are good, but not great - Reach's outshine them by a long shot, but Black Ops, like W@W, has very realistic gore in it, which Reach lacks. Now for the negatives... Multiplayer. Most people only play Call of Duty anymore for the online Multiplayer. You guys, back off, Black Ops's MP is awful. The maps are basically just a bunch of corridors and a few back alleys with windows to give people a ""sniping perch."" FAIL. Fifteen feet isn't nearly enough room to merit a sniper rifle use... heck, an MP5K would work better. Speaking of that, SMG`s seem to dominate the maps due to the lack of space. Snipers, as said before, out of the picture. LMG`s need a little room to use... The Stoner 63 is the only one worth using AT ALL, but you can't get that until you've bought all of the other LMG`s that you'll likely never use. AR`s are still useful, and Shotguns, primaries again, are actually usable to the same degree of effectiveness as, say, the M60 (LMG). All the weapons shoot a lot better than MW2's, though, so on the only good maps, Jungle and Array, it's actually fun to use them - heck, you can even snipe on these maps! I'd like to complain about the unlock system, though - I love the emblem creator and the fact that you can buy any perk you want at any time, saves me a lot of crap. But I no longer feel encouraged to use a weapon a lot so I can unlock all the attachments. In MW2, I'd stick with the M4 or whatever until I'd gotten everything, except Extended Mags (too hard for me lol) and the Shotgun (I loathe Noob Tubes, I only managed to unlock the shotgun for my absolute FAVORITE guns). Now, you buy each gun for 2000 CoD points, and then any attachment for 1000 - Suppressors are 2000, and Noob Tubes are 3000. Then you're finished. I don't want to waste my CoD points trying out different attachments. MW2 MADE you use them to get XP and more attachments. I now LOVE the ACOG Scope on the ACR - I never would've used that if the Thermal Scope hadn't been involved. There's no motivation here. I didn't realize that I liked the M16 with an ACOG Scope until just recently, whereas I'd have used it the instant I got it to get that Thermal (Infrared, in BO) Scope.Final thoughts - Good Game.

This game is gonna sell like gangbusters due to a great marketing campaign and franchise recognition. Sad, as this is just about the only positive thing I can say about this game. First off, it is not half the game ""Medal of Honor"" is, especially the single player. True, the plot might be intriguing, but the execution is laughable. Just by virtue of being a Treyarch game that doesn't completely suck, this somehow translates into being on par with the best in the genre? Right...Going on, the color palette in ""Black Ops"" is horrendous, the graphics are generally bland and the scripting just as present as in every other title out there. However, this game gets away easy in reviews when it comes to this. Why? It's ""Call of Duty"".Aside from the visuals, the sound design is also mediocre. Listen to this next to ""Medal of Honor"" on a sound system (or heck; just your TV) and tell me which has the better sound mix. Hint: It is not ""Black Ops"". In fact, ""Medal of Honor"" has the best sound mix I have ever heard in a game. It is truly an acoustic marvel, and deserves to be heard.Adding insult to injury, a set of spastic, drugged-out-of-their-minds and pathetically acted scenes is what we get to tie everything together. ""Black"" did this in a much better way in 2006. On the Xbox and PS2, nonetheless.Also, many have made a point out of the ethical dilemma one faces when setting a FPS to a real world war. How the situation demands respect and thought. In this regard, in whatever way ""Medal of Honor"" failed to do so in regards to the current war in Afghanistan absolutely pales in comparison to the travesty Treyarch gives us here. JFK as a zombie-killer side-by-side with Castro? Now there is respect and historical accuracy for you! The Infinity Ward games, while being ridiculous at times, at least knew where to draw the line. Not so here. ""Black Ops"" is a dumb game by design and proud of it.In short:I will return ""Black Ops"" to my game retailer and get a title worth playing instead. ""This years Biggest Disappointment""? Achievement unlocked.\"

Not to mention just endless waves of zombies gets old quick.  The co-op in MW2 had hours of excitement  for me and my friends. We had to function like a small Spec-ops team to complete the maps. You needed: communication, precision, and teamwork to do the missions. Not like Multi-player where no matter what organization an communication you try to establish everyone runs around and does there own thing. There is a ""Combat Training"" mode you can play privately with your  friends, but event the AI runs around like decapitated chickens.  If they offered non-zombie co-op maps in the future maybe ill buy them (maybe) or hold my breath waiting for it to return next year.Overall a great game.

2010,Call of Duty: Black Ops,"One of my favorite cods. The campaign is fantastic. The story is far different from cods typical war. It involves hallucinations of people and the images and sounds of random numbers into your head. The disturbing sight of your hand shaking and aiming a gun to jfk with a terrifying screaming in the background, or the multiple hallucinations in the second to last level as you stumble around an empty building as you realize one of your closest teamates was never really with you at all and had been dead for years. The mind bending story is not original, but its fun and different. The multiplayer is good and fixes many problems in mw2 involving balancing. No major flaws in my experience.

2010,Call of Duty: Black Ops,"I really don't understand why so many people are giving this game a zero. I think that people are just stretching the truth to make the game seem worse than it actually is because they have something against Activision and Treyarch. It's not the perfect game - graphics are a bit dated, some parts on MP are a little buggy, but I've played worse. Namely, MW2.Let me explain. MW2's singleI really don't understand why so many people are giving this game a zero. I think that people are just stretching the truth to make the game seem worse than it actually is because they have something against Activision and Treyarch. It's not the perfect game - graphics are a bit dated, some parts on MP are a little buggy, but I've played worse. Namely, MW2.Let me explain. MW2's single player was extremely addictive, if a bit short, but I played through it at least three times. The multiplayer, however, was broken. Campers and boosters everywhere, quickscoping was rampant, and you had squeakers trash talking you every time you played something that wasn't vanilla TDM. So, I traded it in and waited for Black Ops to come out.The single player in Black Ops, while I haven't finished it, has its good and bad points. The cut-scenes are incredible and the story immersing, but there's no introduction. I found that kind of weird. Also, I'm stuck on a mission where the instructions seem to be misleading - but I put that down to my lack of prowess at video games in general.So far, I've spent most of my time in Multiplayer. I had to say, I wasn't expecting much after MW2 and it's horrendous multiplayer feature. The matchmaking system didn't inspire much confidence either - I don't seem to be able to get a 4 bar connection in any games that I've played, while I had 4 bars every time in MW2. My major gripe is the broken matchmaking system, particularly in Wager Matches actually. Despite there being 15k people in Gun Game, it takes on average 5 minutes for me to join a game. Sticks and Stones isn't much better, and Sharpshooter is incredibly broken. I don't think I've actually played a game of Sharpshooter where it didn't switch to a random game mode afterward. One In The Chamber seems to be the only game mode that's perfect. Speaking of Wager Matches, I like the CoD points idea. It adds a dimension to the game - do I save up and get this gun, or do I spend it as soon as I unlock this one?This, however, presents another problem. I played this game at launch and since most people still had the crappy guns you start off with, so I didn't notice this issue at first. However, once people unlock the AK74u and the FAMAS, the starter guns become completely obsolete. People who play 24h a day to get the best guns will have an advantage over people who play 2h a week at best, like me. The guns you have until about level 14 aren't balanced with the rest of the guns. I almost gave up the game because the Enfield, the MP5K and the Skorpion prove absolutely useless. Once you get there, though, the guns are well balanced, and each serves its own distinctive purpose. It takes forever to level up to get to the good stuff, so if you stick with it you will be rewarded.Moving on. I like that Black Ops is less of a ""twitch shooter"" than MW2 was. The game doesn't center round the knife because it can be beaten very easily. Grenade Launchers have been nerfed in several ways, including the price, the blast radius and the fact that Warlord (BO's version of Bling) doesn't work if you equip a grenade launcher. Quickscoping is nearly impossible to do now - good news for everyone over the age of 12. Camping spots are fewer and farther between, and, with the exception of a few maps, camping doesn't really help you. The nuke has been taken out, which is a plus. The Chopper Gunner and the Gunship don't stack on to your killstreak, and they are less powerful now. Because of all of these combined, I feel less like, ""C'mon, gotta get my Harrier... FFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUU I DIED"" and more like ""Oh cool, I got a Helicopter."" when you get killstreaks. I could go on all day about what I like, frankly, but there's not enough room here.In short, I feel that Black Ops has taken everything good about MW2, and filtered out the annoyances. If you liked MW2, you'll love this. If you didn't, however, don't buy it, and stop writing zero-rated reviews full of fluff on how you prefer Battlefield, Medal of Honor, etc - go play that, instead of complaining.\"

You also can't play with bots when you have 3-4 player split screen. That's extremely dumb since wager matches are awesome and should be split screen playable. It's addicting and extremely well made.

2010,Call of Duty: Black Ops,"Many of my friends and various critics are raving about this jewel encrusted gift from the heavens, COD Black Ops; because of their rave review I went out and spent 60$ on this game. Put it in the Xbox and was immediately blown away by the fantastic opening cut scene and neat menu, selected my difficulty and began my experience. I though the whole interrogation thing was pretty cool, even though it was exactly like the one in Black for the PS2 some years ago, and began playing the first mission. Liked it at first and close up the graphics in the ""cut scenes"" were pretty good. Then I walked out of the bar and began shooting. that is when I noticed the terrible visuals. After about 30ft everything just blends together and becomes one massive blob of brown. I failed that mission a few times because I shot civilians instead of soldiers because I couldn't tell the difference; the visuals are that muddy. The weapon sounds also don't sound very good either. Whatever I thought, a bit of a sacrifice for good game play right? Wrong. After shooting a large number of endlessly re-spawning enemies, which all look identical by the way, I got to an alley with a car. I thought, ""Wow please don't tell me I have to drive that?"" remembering all the terrible driving sections in Treyarch's previous COD titles. Sure enough I have to drive it that was terrible, however, you smash through a road block which was pretty good but I missed most of the awesomeness of the situation  because the screen fades and they yank you back to the stupid interrogation which just reiterates plot points that we all got hours ago. This wouldn't be so bad, but it seems, especially in the beginning of the game, they do this during every awesome moment of game play. After some more cut scenes I'm in prison with Reznov, and fighting my way past many Russian prison guards, that again, look all the same. This mission annoyed me. At one point a hallway opens up with a room at the end with enemies in, it turn out this is where they all endlessly re-spawn. if you walk down it it fails you. Not fair considering it never warns you or anything. It does this a few times in the game. It fails the mission for no reason, just because you didn't do something that the game never explained or because you walked down a hallway.So you escape and so begins the rather preposterous, linear and samey, story of Mason. You skip about time and every location on the globe killing everything you see, mostly Russians. The missions are very gimmicky and would only be appealing if you don't have a brain and are easily distracted by action cinema cliches. Missions involve you following a linear path doing the same thing again and again, fighting of waves of re-spawning enemies. Also, all of the characters confuse swearing for wit. More F-Bombs are dropped in the first minute of game play than in all COD games combines.  The campaign isn't terrible, but it isn't anything new or exciting. It is a little longer than MW2s campaign but not nearly as good. Now as I'm explaining this to me friends the insist to me that the campaign isn't that good. They say to me, ""Well hey yeah multiplayer makes up for it though."" ""It is the best in any COD game."" I question why I should pay 60$ for a game that is only have good, but they convinced me to try it,Multiplayer is even worse. Let's start with the Zombie modes. Zombies had always been fun. Now it isn't. The maps are so huge, dark and confusing that it isn't fun. It is just frustrating. the characters and their voices are still as annoying as in WAW. Voice acting in this game is generally not very good,  just so annoying.  Now online multiplayer. the first thing I noticed was the extremely confusing menu. It has so many options and information hidden in so many menus that it makes Microsoft Access look fun and inviting. So I get into a game and the next thing I notice is the lame controls. The sticks respond even slower than in single player. Also, the maps are all horrible. Terrible lay outs and spawns coupled with the graphical issue make spotting enemies nearly impossible. There are very few good perks, weapons do no damage, especially early level ones. Not to mention they all have the same rear iron sight, that is on backwards, and the fact that half them weren't even invented yet. What really makes multiplayer unplayable is the lag and connections. It takes ages to find a game and when it does it usually lags so bad that you can't move or it just kicks you or someone in your party out of the game. Not fun. Unlocks are dumb as well. Why should I have to unlock game modes and buy guns and attachments that I already unlocked? So if you are stupid enough to wast all your money on a gun that isn't very good you're stuck with it. Kill streaks are even more game breaking than in MW2 . So to sum everything up, a very overpriced, over hyped, generic FPS. Not bad not good.\"

Then as the years wen't by, I realized that this wasn't a unique take on island warfare but simply how every single AI in COD games operates.Then I played MW2, and fell in love.  You felt free to act, and on veteran, the game was still challenging.  The worlds were large, and the enemies didn't re-spawn to infinity. This allowed you to actually be creative in your strategy, instead of tunneling. You could fall back, flank, snipe, or rush.  Level design facilitated all strategies and the AI responded. Some levels set up better for different strategies, but the important thing is that it felt organic.  When players died, they felt they could do something different--that they had control.A majority of the positive reviews for this game focus on its numerous improvement over other Treyarch offerings, which is a valid statment. The graphics, story, voice acting, and music are a step up, as well as the addition of some ""cool moments,"" and extras like Zombies. However, there are serious problems that get brushed over.  I feel like multilayer issues have been covered. So this review will tackle single player.On easier difficulties, it does seem fluid.  The fundamental problems only express themselves at the more difficult settings. This is largely due to the fact that Treyarch uses infinite enemy spawns to compensate for poor, predictable level design and sub-par AI.  Eventually you realize that besides a few ""cool"" roller-coaster moments type moments--fun but there's only one track, most of the game consists of a long corridor or enclosed ""box"" with predictably placed pieces of cover.  Yes, you are in a box. Even though there are things going on outside the ""box"" and the graphics seemingly connect them, you cannot interact with them. Visually its a large world; in practice it's claustrophobic.  Enemies advance mindlessly in single file from the back of the cover to your position, eventually charging recklessly from the last piece of cover.  To ""kill"" them you need to toss smoke grenades, sprint past some imaginary line, and hunker down.  If you get unlucky and get shot in the face, prepare to live the last 5 minutes of your life over and over again.Lets be frank--in the early versions of the game, this was a necessity because of inherent technical limitations.  The ""box"" existed because large interactive environments weren't possible. The endless spawns were needed because AI was terrible.  It was necessary to have smoke grenades because these other compensations made certain configurations of enemies and cover frustrating.   Purists might say ""This is Call of Duty,""  but how many other games get bad marks for refusing to innovate from their predecessors?In Black-Ops it feels like you just got unlucky playing the exact same interaction over and over again in the only way possible to play it. More specifically, it feels like you are forced to engage in the same interaction, requiring the same strategy with the same probability of success again and again.  You are bound to get unlucky and die, even doing the right thing.  When you do, unpredictable load points reward you with the with the same set of identical interactions and identical solutions.Throw smoke and run into it seems like a poor mechanic after a while. In IW games you throw smoke to get a tactical advantage, get a way, or provide temporary cover to move to a new position.  In Treyarch games, you do it because its the best way to stop infinite spawns.  The former feels immersive, the latter feels like band-aid for poor game design.Halo got a lot of crap for repeated area designs, but at least there were multiple ways to attack each situation.  As Bungie put it, it was the same \"
2010,Call of Duty: Black Ops,"It's a much better game than Modern Warfare 2, but it doesn't really feel as fresh as it probably should. The new additions Treyarch made don't really help the gameplay much, and seeing as most people have played MW2 to death, there's really no reason for anyone other than hardcore COD fans to buy Black Ops."

It's not as ""solid"" a game as Infinity Ward's previous titles. And Treyarch is still not as good at creating maps as Infinity Ward's, but it's by no means bad.The story is a bit short but really cinematic and intense, it's very similar to Modern Warfare 2's, as you might expect.

You receive $ for playing each match and use this currency to buy attachments, perks, and other items. One new item that looks interesting is the sticky cam. You can place it around a corner and then watch for the enemy. If you enjoyed the previous COD:MW game you should enjoy this one as well. The one gripe I do have is that the cut scenes between levels in the campaign are too long. Most last for several minutes or at least it seems so.\"

When it comes to multiplayer, Treyarch does an extremely good job. Tons of customization, right down to face paint and logos on weapons. They introduced a credit system in the game that serves as a form of currency. After each match you get a certain amount of credits based off your performance. In turn, you spend credits on purchasing, pretty much, everything in the game: guns, attachments, camo, reticle, perks, etc. There is also much more stat tracking that you have to figure out on your own, because it really does seem endless.Overall, Black Ops is a fine first-person shooter. It has that same COD quality that keeps people coming back each year, plus more. It's single-player is fresh, and original, taking around 6-8 hours to finish (play of hardened your first time). Treyarch made multiplayer even more user-friendly with crazy amounts of customization and the added wager modes give Black Ops even more that it already has...Oh, yeah...Zombies have returned too.It's a complete package. If you have MW2 and are wary, don't be. It's a great game.\"

All weapons are balanced, but automatic weapons have a sight advantage due to the more shots it takes to bring down and opponent, but the M16s are best for long rangeCall of Duty Black Ops has made the largest strides of created a new and improved Call of Duty experience, and succeeded with flying colors. The gameplay finally is balanced, no more will you die via UMP across the map. All weapons are balanced, but automatic weapons have a sight advantage due to the more shots it takes to bring down and opponent, but the M16s are best for long range shooting anyways. Also, the fact that killstreaks do not stack anymore focuses more on the shooting nature of the game, as CoD4 did. This is a huge relief, and rises out of the killstreak heavy MW2 gameplay.The best addition is the way you buy weapons. They are unlocked regularly, but now you can buy the attachments, instead of playing countless games, slaving to get fmj for a weapon. This addition helps the game focus more on the gameplay. The addition of diving to prone is also a helpful addition to get a jump on the enemy.The addition of theater mode is a nice touch as well, giving players the halo treatment. Also, custom matches finally organize private no scope matches. Also, the ability to personalize weapons and emblems really gives the player a larger sense of creativity.Finally, with the addition of split screen online multiplayer, players can also entertain their friends with an online experience that was only provide before by halo. This is a feature that fans screamed for and someone FINALLY listened.The campaign in this game is much better than the previous games. The player is put into the middle of a grand mystery of the main characters mind. The government is trying to exract information that was wiped after your character went missing in action. The player goes through their characters past experiences and finds unique twists.The Zombies mode is slightly bumped down from WaW, with the addition of wierd crawling zombies that disorient the player. It seems Treyarch tried to complicate this mode more than it should have been. But the fact that players can control Presidents JFK and Nixon against Nazi Zombies is as humorous as it is fun. The downfalls of this game happen in the multiplayer maps and graphics department. The half the maps are  fine, but some maps are too large for simple team deathmatches. Expect games to go on for the full length of time due to the large amounts of places players can hide. No one finds anyone for 30 seconds sometimes. Also, the graphics seem like a major step down from MW2. This game lost MW2's realism, but that does not mean that the game looks terrible to any extend. Just different.All in all, Call of Duty Balck Ops is the greatest of the series so far. The improvements shadow the minor glitches and out dated graphics. But the largeness of the maps, typical in Treyarch games, really bring down online gameplay. If you are looking for a strong predessor to the worlds top selling game, look no further than Black Ops.\"

Treyarch said they did not want their game to end up like MW2, well Congratulations its WORSE. at least MW2 had decent enough Hit Registration and the Spawn system was not completely broken. MW2 also had balanced maps where sniping was at least possible. When they announced they were removing Stopping Power from the game i was ecstatic i thought they would finally realize that  A BULLET IS A BULLET!!!! guns should not have damage stats. They should remove damage as a stat for weapons and focus primarily on range, accuracy, mobility and rate of fire. if you get hit with a bullet you DIE. just because my gun has 4 bars of Damage and yours has 5 does not mean u win a fire fight when i put 3 rounds into your skull. If you, like myself, loved sniping well then your out of luck in order to fight the ""War on Quickscoping"" that Treyarch believes is happening they made it so if you  don't aim down the sights for a full 2 seconds your bullet flies in some random direction like a revolutionary war musket. Threyarch needs to stop making promises they cant keep. they said it would be close to impossible to hack this game well its been a little over a month since the games release and there are already Wall hacks, Aim-bots, God Mode, No Clip, Infinite Ammo and much much more. The spawn system is non existent as well the game will consistently spawn you in the same location so some retard can run over to you place a sentry gun at your spawn and rack up the kills. The lag is also an extreme issue, if you do not have a 4 bar connection then it is virtually impossible to get a legitimate kill. Even at 3 bars bullets fail to register and do almost no damage. In MW2 it felt as if maybe 10-15% of your bullets might go unaccounted for well in BO change that to at least 50-75% of them. That may be an over exaggeration to some people but when you unload 15 bullets into one guy just to have him wheel around and shoot you twice in the leg and kill you something is definitely wrong. This game practically rewards mediocrity, the RC car is the most OP kill-streak ever put into a game, a 3 year old child with down syndrome could get the 2 kills in a row it takes ( i know its 3 kills but since everyone turns hard-line on anyway, you might as well make it 2) to get that reward. people literally can just do completely **** the whole game and towards the end just say, "" hey look i have ten RCXD's to spawn kill people with"". This game literally has  so many bugs that  by gaming ""law"" is Literally considered BROKEN. just to name a few... Railings: the spaces between railings on balcony's and stairs are programed as ""walls"" so you either can or can not shoot through them while doing minimal damage, Wanted: this is just what I'm calling it since i do not know the exact term, but when people shoot behind you as you run around cover and despite not hitting you at all the bullets almost seem to curve around the corner and get you anyway,KNIFING: its broken now so don't even try. the prime rule is, If you think you got him...you didn't. If you think you didn't get him... then you did. Air knifes are much more common then MW2 and 3arc really doesn't seem to care about it. This game literally did nothing new to the Cod franchise beside steal a bunch of ideas from Halo like their ""new"" currency system and map selecting in Multi player. Overall this is a piss poor game with outdated graphics and a Company backing it, cough* cough* Activision, that's to greedy to give a **** that their game has some serious problems that need addressing. If you wonder why the graphics are bad then, again look at Activison, they thought it would be a good idea to make the game 3D compatible so they down graded the graphics to satisfy the 2%  margin of gamers with 3D TV's. Seriously if your going to market to a certain group then you should pick a larger one then that. This game, just like Modern Warfare 2, was fun at first but now is just another failed project. And to those who might say, ""Oh you just suck, thats why ur mad"", no, my KD is 2.05 and it i have 15,000 kills so no. I just know what a good game is, and this is not it. I think ill go back to Bad Company 2 and wait for Vietnam in 3 days. Lets hope Sledgehammer games learns from this and doesn't screw up Modern Warfare 3.\"

The single player campaign is just a bunch of random scenarios tied together with a ridiculously predictable plot.  The multiplayer maps are mediocre compared to modern warfare 1 and 2 maps.  But I guess they are designed for people who would rather mindlessly run at each other than climb even a simple learning curve.  Why else would nuketown be voted for over and over again for hours before the patch limiting replaying a map was released.  Which leads me to spawn locations.  In every CoD I have never been killed or got a kill within a seconds of spawning as much as I do in black ops.  This games adds nothing new to the series besides tomahawks and wager matches that usually rely more on luck than any skill, so it drives me crazy how so many ""critics"" sellout and give this game such high ratings just to appeal to the masses when other game sequels are bashed for being just a reiteration of a previous release.  Maybe if the next CoD brings back the quality and entertainment of the first modern warfare the ""critics"" will throw tens at it claiming it is the best fps ever created.  Who knows, OXM might even give it an 11, of course then they would start giving tons of games 11 and make a 12 to justify the scores...Overall I would give this game a 6 just because S&D can be a lot of fun, but every time I play I remember how much more fun I had on better made maps with a wider variety of weapons worth using.  But I'm gonna have to go with 0 to balance out the people giving 10's with reasons such as ""by far the most complete and deep gaming experience in history"" or ""I don't understand why so many people are complaining about this game."" or my favorite ""I detect battlefield fanboys in these reviews. a 0 without any reasoning to back it up?"", by the way he doesn't give a single reason why the game deserves the 10 he gave it.\"

That being said there are some lingering issues that really hold this game back. 1. The A.I. is just terrible. I know COD has never been accused of having great A.I. but Black Ops really seems to make it worse. There are numerous times where your allies and enemies will simply ignore each other.. I've witnessed an A.I. teammate and enemy literally standing back to back firing in opposite directions, completely oblivious to the others presence. You'll see your teammates run right past enemies, I mean they'll pass each other on a narrow pathway without even a nod. It's just weird, and it happens frequently enough that you can't help but notice it and feel disappointed.2. Instant deaths... I don't know if the enemy headshot percentages were boosted or what but I found myself dying inexplicably a number of times during the campaign. As in other CODs once you start taking hits the screen starts turning red until you can't hardly see  and then die. Generally you have a pretty good idea of how much punishment you can take before you die. But in Black Ops I found myself going from perfectly fine to dead instantly. And the game always tells you if you die from a grenade or exploding barrel or something like that, so I know that's not the issue. The only thing I can come up with is that I was hit in the head, but if that's the case then the enemies accuracy must have really been cranked up. Either way it becomes incredibly frustrating when you die out of nowhere, and it's not something that I've witnessed happening in any of the other CODs.3. The Story...it's not terrible, but it's not very original either. I was interested at first, there's an air of mystery, but once I realized where the story was going I just found myself going through the motions to finish the game. The game treats the big reveal like a shocking surprise, but really, you saw it coming a few levels back. That's not to say the last few levels are bad, they're actually very good, and the final level is great, it's just the story that accompanies it fizzles out by that point.Then there's the multiplayer....think of it as a huge map pack for Modern Warfare 2. If you didn't know the maps you'd have a hard time knowing which one was which if you were watching them side-by-side. I almost wish they'd gone back to WWII just for the multiplayer. At least then it would feel distinct. World at War had its own style that I really enjoyed, so I was a bit disappointed when I first saw Blacks Ops multiplayer in action. It's good. It has some great new modes and the wager matches are a fine idea. COD points are a nice touch for upgrading your equipment the way YOU want to instead of everyone at say level 35 having the same things unlocked. So overall I think it is an improvement over Modern Warfare 2 and I'll certainly spend many hours playing.Black Ops is great package, and will certainly keep you occupied until the next COD lands, but for me, this is the first time I've played a COD game and thought, ""I could've probably skipped this one and never really regretted it.""\"

The problem with this game is not that it's another typical CoD game with frustratingly tedious multiplayer (we already know to expect that), but that it's actually WORSE in almost every respect to the game that came before it. It should have come of no surprise that Treyarch is the inferior of the two CoD companies, but it's amazing just much they ruined a franchise that was already so bland. Black Ops suffers from worse balancing, worse visuals, worse maps, worse EVERYTHING when compared to MW2. The only saving graces are insignificant pieces like a theater mode taken straight from Halo, some gun customization, and a couple zombies levels that are sure to excite you for maybe an entire week! Of course, people will buy it, as CoD is the milk that feeds that mainstream non-gamer's hunger for a game where you can literally lie down and wait and still be considered great. So, if you like a game riddled with campers, cheap little ""killstreaks"", a host of connection issues and bugs, and all that other fun stuff, look no further! For those who are actually willing to earn their wins and work for their glory, try looking at a Halo or Battlefield game.

That brings us to multiplayer this is the bread and butter of the call of duty series and it does deliver a solid call of duty experience.

Zombie mode is alot of fun. Black ops has more modes than any of the games in the series which is why recomend you buy it.\

I mostly bought the game to play the multiplayer with my friends, and even that can get boring after even less than 8 hours of play. The maps are boring and very simplistic, and often you end up getting the same map over and over again. I'm not trying to sound like an MW2 fanboy or a Halo fanboy, but both of those games improved on and at least added new controls, weapons, equipment, etc. Black Ops is pretty repetitive at best in certain game types, and they are usually dominated by one team that is filled with campers, people that exploit broken combinations, and similar things. The formula can be fun if you have fun players that do not ""camp"", or use unfair advantages like overpowered guns. I'll probably ditch the multiplayer for now, and stick to the campaign, but after that I will probably go back to playing other games.\"

There also seems to be less difference between the damage inflicted by each of the weapons with most battles being won by who ever sees the opponent first.  While the game is not terrible by any means, it is a step backwards from MODW2.  If you already own MODW2, my advice is don't waste your money on this.\"

Until I found out who developed the game. Freakin Treyarch, when they're the one's making a Call of Duty game, it's never a good sign. I decided to get it and try it anyway, but ended up trading it in literally days after I got it. It was boring, why was it boring? Because it's the exact same thing as any other Call of Duty game. There's nothing new here at all, not even the Zombie mode is new, that was available in World At War, which was also made by freakin Treyarch. If only Infinity Ward were the ones making every Call of Duty game, the series would be so much better, I spit at Activision for firing them. This company releases a new Call of Duty game every year, but they hardly make good upgrades with them, and most of the time, it's the same game that we had last time. The only Call of Duty games that were any kind of upgrade were the Modern Warfare games. Those are fun. But what about Black Ops? Again, same thing we've been playing for a long time, no upgrades other than earning credits to spend on weapon upgrades, but is that really worth paying $60 for, over just playing a Call of Duty you already have that's the same exact thing? The multiplayer is the same, the zombie mode is the same, and the campaign is just plain stupid. Worst shooter campaign I've ever seen. Now this doesn't mean that the game isn't enjoyable by some people. The multiplayer is fun for a while, but it's really not different from what you already have. Here's basically who this game is for, it is specifically made for hardcore fans of the series. It's like the Majora's Mask of Call of Duty, only huge fans will like it alot. As for those who are new to shooters, or those who like playing Call of Duty but are not real big fans of it, like me, this game is not for you. If you want to play a Call of Duty game, just play Call of Duty 4. It is much more entertaining than Black Ops, and unlike Black Ops Call of Duty 4 was a great game changer for the series.

While there are a dozen or so other games I'd like to play, including one or two in the CoD series itself.The campaign is nice, though you don't learn much about the characters. Basically, the Russians have created a super-deadly bio-chemical weapon and you have to remember how to stop it's activation. It starts in an interrogation room, where you're told to try and remember what a cryptic set of numbers mean. The missions, which, speaking story-wise, are flashbacks, should take you about 15-25 minutes to complete, of which there are about 15 missions. The plot is good, with a few big twists, most of which seemed to come out of nowhere, but make you say, ""What? Oh. Oh, yeah! I get it!"". The zombies mode is back, with two built in maps, a mansion and the pentagon. Just as fun and addictive as ever.But as with any first-person shooter, the multiplayer is what everyone (but me) buys the game for. There are several great maps, including my favorite: a close quarters map called ""Nuketown"". The gamemodes include the classics like team deathmatch and a new kind of game mode called wager. In wager, you bet your currency points (called CoD points) that you'll come in the top three ranking players in the game. I don't like the wagering in this mode so much (you could win four times as much easily in a regular match without risking losing a couple), but I love the game modes, like ""One in the chamber,"" where everyone has one bullet, and if they miss, they're forced to knife their way to victory. Every kill grants you another bullet, and it's a nice twist to regular first person shooter attitude which is, ""Screw the ammo, SHOOT SHOOT SHOOT!""All together, Black Ops is a great game, and fans of the series or genre should definitely add this to their respective collections.\"

2010,God of war 3,"There are several reasons why the God of War games are successful: Gore, smooth combat, amazing voice acting/overall sound quality/score, Kratos, graphics, and difficulty. Now what do they do for the sequels? They advance the story (on the psp games backstory), improve graphics, and fix any problems while adding some improvements, and this leads to one of the greatest single-player games of all time in God of War 3.  The most a game on max difficulty has killed me is around 30 times (original God of War), when I played THIS game on max difficulty, I died 300 times (no seriously, I counted) on the first boss. THE FIRST BOSS. I loved it. I freaking cheered when I finally beat the first boss, and that's the thing that games should strive for: the feeling of achievement.  This game also stepped up in the combat department, with new weapons, improved controls to get your weapons out (the first two games frustrated me whenever I changed the weapons), and changing the locations of quick-timer buttons, as well as adding a BEAUTIFUL abundance of gore. The graphics are jaw-dropping. This is beyond a shadow of a doubt one of the best looking games of all time (behind only Heavy Rain and, based on the trailers, Battlefield 3). The puzzles are complex but one puzzle in particular is just annoying in the musical puzzle. The game only steps it up in the cinematic feel, with the graphics, the always stellar voice acting, and now, scaling the bodies of Titans themselves, especially the Cronus battle, undoubtedly among the greatest boss battles of all time, if for nothing else scale and lack of anticipation, no one saw that coming.

Combat hasn't changed much from the previous titles, with you still swinging fiery blades on the chains, but it has some improvements to make it more fluid. The plot may not be anything more than just a link between brutal murder of important Greek mythology characters, but I wouldn't call it ""unsatisfying"" and it still makes sense.

2010,God of war 3,"God of War III is a masterpiece of a game for the PS3, and Sony Santa Monica outdid themselves after the acclaimed God of War and GoW 2 games.This game concludes Kratos' story of revenge against the Gods of Olympus in fictional Ancient Greece.

GoW III features the most WOW opening of any game I can remember, with Kratos charging against Mount Olympus while riding Gaia and his allies the Titans, then fights and kills Poseidon straight away before being sent to the Underworld by Zeus so that the game proper can begin (hey, if that didn't happen the game would last 3 hours max). What better and more epic way to start a game! But the rest of it is no slouch. Each new boss battle is better than the last. Each new area is bigger and better than the previous one. Even violence has become more prevalent, there were moments I sympathised with Kratos' victims, but there is nothing too gory. The final fight against Zeus is mostly presented as a 2D fighting game, which is a nice change of pace. Ultimately Kratos wipes the Greeks gods out of the face of the Earth. Surprise! XD Don't say I spoilt the story. Did you really expect anything different?Graphics are amazing, the epic scale of battles has become even more epic (the battle against the Titan Kronos is featured in no other game), gameplay is as always solid with a mix of hack n' slash, platforming and puzzles (unfortunately there is a puzzle late in the game that plays with perspective and I couldn't solve it without reading a walkthrough). The only bad thing technically is the frame rate. The first 2 games' 60 fps (a standard for this genre of games) is replaced with an unlocked 30-45 fps, but playability isn't compromised at all. It's just that some hypersensitive players may see it as negative, but I am not one of them.All in all, God of War III is a terrific game. Thankfully it has been remastered and re-released on PS4. Just buy it and play it, it's one of the best and most spectacular games you will ever experience.\"
2010,God of war 3,"In my opinion, the best God of War game by far. Storyline is simple but it works very well thanks to mythology, and gameplay is even better than in the previous games. Ttechnical power is evidently much larger as well, so the game really outstands over all the others GoW in terms of graphics and sequences."

2010,God of war 3,God of war III is the game for the brutal greek in all of us. Its graphics are beyond belief. The bosses are each evicerated with ethusiasm and creativity.

There's four excellent weapons at your disposal, each with it's own unique combat style to prevent the game feeling repetitive. Gameplay is smooth and responsive and extremely satisfying. GoW III is an astounding gaming experience.Sound = The orchestral score throughout the game is phenomenal, voice-acting is top notch, enemies/ weapons/ environment all sounds incredible.God of War III will take around 12 hours to complete, once the single player is done you have the combat arena challenges to play through and you can play custom combat arena games. Theres also hours of videos to watch 'The making of God of War III'.  In terms of replayability I've completed it 7 times now, I just can't get enough of this masterpiece of a game. My advice to anyone who owns a PS3 is to get the God of War Collection and God of War III, even if you don't particularly like action adventure/ hack 'n' slash games you will not regret it. The God of War series is some of the best gaming has to offer, God of War III is a mind-blowing masterpiece of a game.\"

You know exactly what your getting. The best there is to offer with your Blades of Exile and new weapons like Claws of Hades and Nemesis whip its so easy to come to terms and addictive as hell. Very few games can draw you in from word go and continue to deliver such a high quality experience but God of War does does with effortlessly. The story is a fitting end for one of gamings ultimate protagonists. Picking up from where GoWII left off Kratos and his initals allies - The Titans storm Mount Olympus in attempt to destroy Zeus and the Olympic Gods. Bloody, gory and violent as hell theres nothing like this out there its in a league of its own. Its a game that very simply deserves to be played by any and every PS3 owner because its a masterpiece and a game that you cannot afford to miss out on. One of the defining moments in what is without question one of the finest gaming achievements to date, probably as closs to perfection you will get if it is to be the final outing for the God of War series.

It's the same formula the series has been using since the first game, just without all of the awesomeness that made those games so great to play. There are some thrills here and there and the combat is suitably entertaining, but what makes GOW 3 so disappointing is that where the previous games were epic and raised the bar for action games, GOW 3 is just average and feels like another face in the crowd. The game looks gorgeous, three years later and this is still one of the PS3's best looking titles, and the soundtrack is fantastic. The story takes a hit this time around by making Kratos a much less likable character. I was able to sympathize and support Kratos' motives in previous GOW games, but after watching Kratos butcher innocent people who had nothing to do with his conflict I began to like the character less and less. He manages to have a few redeeming moments near the end, but I still wouldn't call him a likable character after this game. The story still has some cool moments, especially when it references all the other GOW games (even the PSP titles!). It's not a bad game, just a dull one. It's a disappointing conclusion to a fantastic series because while the other games are amazing this one manages to just be passable experience because it lacks the fun that previous GOW titles have brought.\"
2010,God of war 3,"Wow...Just wow.Having been a fan from the beginning I can say that this is the best and most ambitious GOW.Though the gameplay is identical to the previous titles,that matters little when blown away by the scope of this game.Face melting graphics,brutal hack and slash and pure sexyness make this one to remember."

I can understand that the format was getting old (even though I personally still enjoyed it) and that some went so far as to consider it 'dated' - I could even understand it if they had changed the 'old' format in a way which was original and corresponded with the rest of the series. However, the way in which they have so blatantly ripped off Dawn of War and other RTS 'rivals' is unbelievable. I don't even really think that those sort of games are rivals, most of the people I know into strategy games play both, and for different reasons! To make things worse, the only redeeming features that this game actually has are the ones robbed from these other games, which leaves not much to praise in C&C4.

The first 45 minutes of the game are a lot of fun, but by the time you get to the Malcolm McDowell puzzle scenes, it's seriously boring and graphically unimpressive. And the plot? Kratos wants to save a young girl who reminds him of his daughter, but he has no problem moments later grinding another young woman in the cogs of a machine? Okaaay. That scene is actually made even worse by the fact that Santa Monica Studios chose to have her titillatingly bare-breasted - so gamers get to whack-off to her **** just before they get to mutilate her. Yay? Gross. And speaking of Kratos, T.C. Carson's one-note portrayal of the character may have been okay in the days of the Playstation 2, but with titles like Heavy Rain and LA Noire having pushed the acting in video games far beyond their last-gen ghetto, this kind of D-grade voice acting just doesbn't fly anymore. HE'S TERRIBLE. This is made all the clearer when put beside actual talents like Rip Torn - the difference is night and douche.The plot itself doesn't fare much better - are we seriously going BACK to Pandora's Box? Uhhgh... didn't we do this already? Oh, I see, it was empty but wait! - there was something ELSE yet super-secret and invisible inside. Please no. I'd love to see a reboot with a higher quality of voice talent and story writing that at last mactches the awesome level of craftmanship that Santa Monica Studios puts into it's technical game development. Obviously the developer has an incredibly talented team of artists and gaming talent working there, but it all falls apart in the cut scenes when the script is laughable and the voice talent barely B-movie. Just finding a new voice for Kratos alone would automatically boost the series one point, but you still have issues like Kratos' origin itself... which is as silly as it is nonsensical. Um, don't be mad at the gods because you can't control your temper.\"
2010,God of war 3,"Before I start I have to say that  God of War and God of War 2 were and probably still are action games of their time. They had just the right mix of simplistic action thrown into a great setting. If God of War 3 would have came out in PS2 days instead of 2010 while I probably would be more likely to overlook glaring issues that are present in this game.

They had just the right mix of simplistic action thrown into a great setting. If God of War 3 would have came out in PS2 days instead of 2010 while I probably would be more likely to overlook glaring issues that are present in this game. The first and foremost of them is that apart from graphics the game has not evolved from previous titles and even may have been simplified further in GoW3. The combat itself feel very unresponsive when comparing it with other hack and slash games even not of AAA category like Conan, Sengoku Basara Samurai heroes and Afro Samurai. Not only is it unresponsive but its flow is constantly interrupted by quicklime connected to finishers, counter moves and all the bosses are littered with them instead just letting player fight bosses with weapons of their choice. Since this is a boss heavy title lets talk about bosses. Depending on the difficulty level you can just button mash through all of their attacks or on higher difficulty levels due to inability to cancel combos you can only do 1-2 hits and then wait for boss to do its thing and hope bad camera angle doesn't make you take a hit. Neither of the approaches is very fun. Apart from combat there is platforming and it is terribly executed with atrocious camera angles and jumping technique.This GoW game also lacks a story or interesting characters that in some way enhance the experience.To me it feels like this game was all about graphic and no substance.\"
2010,God of war 3,"A game filled with brute force and gore fights. The production is amazing (graphics, music) and the game is full of clever ideas, but the action is repetitive and becomes boring at times."
2010,God of war 3,"I've played all the bigger God of War games, but none is like God of War III... That is in a bad way. The gameplay's basically what you expect; Hack 'n' Slash. It's more fluid than before, but it's still not very revolutionary. Then again, there is no problem with that. There are 3 more weapons, but you'll probably stick with the Blades of Athena (I know they are the Blades of Exile). The graphics, well, haven't improved really. Think about it; God of War II had by far the best graphics on the PS2. Characters were all greatly animated and so was the environment. In GoW III it seems they focused WAAAY too much on Kratos, who basically looks fantastic (Except for his feet), but all other characters and very often the environment just look, compared to Kratos, crappy. The music's awesome, the voice acting solid, but lip-syncing sometimes didn't fit. Now that that's covered, let's get to the most important subject: The Story. I don't understand why so many reviews state the story is great and a superb ending, it's simply not. First of all, the length of it: How is it that the Titans, these huge creatures, had to fight for decades to be defeated by the Gods and Kratos kills a bunch of them in about half a day? Now to the main plot: How come Kratos being a jerk suddenly, instead of that guy from God of War II, who actually cared about his family? He destroys the entire world, which means he destroyed Hades, which means he destroyed Elysium, which means he destroyed his daughter... again. Why is through the destruction of the Sisters of Fate and Kratos bringing the Titans to the ""present"" no influence at all? I mean, how come nobody noticing that the Titans suddenly aren't in Tartarus anymore? Plus, why the heck is Cronus in Tartar-sauce and where is Atlas? C'mon, even if Atlas got his soul or something ripped out, he could still be in the present and after destroying Hades he would've reclaimed his soul. Moving on, Athena. Why? Or better, why is she a greedy ghost, who wants to rule the earth and suddenly has huge breasts? If Ares can't return from the dead, hell, if DEATH can't return from death, how can Athena? It would've been more logical if Kratos had just descended to Hades (without dying) and found Athena, Ares, Thanatos, Deimos, Lysandra (his wife) and Calliope there. That would've been pretty awesome. Alright then, why are the Gods mortal? Seriously, the only Gods, or rather creatures, that were killed by the Blade of Olympus were Cronus, Gaia and Zeus, it didn't exactly kill him, but, oh, well. Hephaestus didn't have anything to do with Pandora's Box. He created Padora, but only on the bidding of Zeus and he wasn't like her father. She was ""born"" as a grown up woman. Pandora's Boy, yeah it did contain the evils of the world, but they would've only been released upon the mortal world. I know that God of War isn't that true on Greek Myth (Check GoW I & II) but at least do somethings right. Daedalus didn't have anything to do with Zeus either. Why Icarus wanted to go to the Sisters of Fate isn't very clear, but at least he had some reason for existence. The Titans, too, were as important as Kratos' butthole. SCE Santa Monica promised there would be entire levels, built on the back of Titans. Where are they? The only real level on an entire Titan was the fight with Cronus and the battle against Poseidon on Gaia. (They were the two most spectaculare battles, too, but killing a God by pushing your thumbs into his eyes is nonsense.) Okay, now what the hell did they want to achieve with the crap about Pandora? ""Hope makes us strong, it is why we are here. It is what we fight with when all else is lost."" WTF? So, basically, what this is supposed to mean is; Hope destroys the earth. Yeah, that makes total sense, right? When the game starts, Kratos is repeating his awesome line from GoW II in a boring way, daylight has returned and, for some reason, the Gods were prepared for the battle. How come? I'll tell you how! During the three years of development Kratos, Gaia and Zeus made a deal. Zeus ""Can you please come back later, we got here some business to do, you know. Reparing this place, getting an army to fight you."" Kratos ""Oh, yeah sure. we'll wait three years for you. I think the weather'll be much better then, too. I got to pump my muscles anyway. I'll say that sentence again, so you can remember better, pops."" Zeus ""Alright, son. See you in three years. Oh, by the way, Hermes is gonna be replaced."" Well, that's probably the only reasonable explanation for the **** start of a **** story which a **** douche-bag created. My verdict: If you want a great and epic Hack 'n' Slash/Action game, buy God of War III, but if you want a great story, pass.\"
2010,God of war 3,"For all of of the great things that can be said for the closing game of the series like gameplay that is as smooth as it is brutal, intuitive controls, glorious presentation and aesthetics, cool flying sequences, all of that's great. However there is one thing, just one thing that completes neutralizes all of this. The story is not only crap-tacular and bland, it also completely betrays who Kratos is as a character, and the themes of God of War.  The true catalyst and possibly the anti-christ of the God of War universe is Pandora, a character who for all intents and purposes, makes no sense. Beyond the constant message i am about to quote from the game ""Hope is what makes us strong. It is why we are here, it is what we fight with when all else is lost."" Seriously, this is the kind of garbage that should be thrown into a second rate Disney movie. Now i know what you're thinking: it's just a video game. True, but this is God of War, a game series that has always been ardently praised for being the pinnacle of storytelling trough Kratos's actions and (gasp!) character development. A story like Kratos's (i.e. Greek tragedy) should not be touting themes of hope and forgiveness. Also that awesome gameplay i mentioned takes a complete nosedive at the end by, and I'm dead serious, GOING INTO FIRST PERSON POV!. Why? Exactly, no reason, and this is after the fifteen minute dream sequence where Kratos FINDS FORGIVENESS and that HOPE WAS INSIDE HIM THE ENTIRE TIME(sorry for using full caps) . Why? the plot said so.  I'm not even going to mention when Athena's ghost shows up for the last time because i could write a whole new rant on the idiocy on that nonsense. Honestly i needed to write this. Aside from the awful writing of the story and resolution, the game is great really, sorry to say that this will forever stain my opinion of this game and of lesser extent the series.\"

First of all it is a halo game. I own all 3 systems and over 200 games. I am a little disappointed in some of the game but lets face it I bought it because of the name Halo and it does follow in its footsteps true to the franchise. The downside of this is that this title did not draw me in. Basically I have to admit to myself I just have played Halo too much and am bored with it. There is no new excitement left. I can't blame the new Reach for this. This is why the series is coming to conclusion. It's just time. That said, this disc is pretty good value. There is so much content on the disc that if you have never played a Halo game this is the version to buy. It is the most updated and best design of any of games released however the story isn't as impressive as some of the other Halo releases. Overall this game is good and if i have any complaint it is more so to do with the fact that the xbox 360 can not process the game as well as i would have liked. The xbox really seems to be pushed to its limits in this game and it shows. When i bought the game i was hoping for a halo version that had Demon's souls feel of battle (fatique with equipment customization), FEAR's AI and Monster Hunter Tri's gathering of usable materials. I guess that's what i was secretly hoping for and it wasn't there. But I can't bash the game because my fantasy wasn't made. This game was designed for its demographic and it certainly isn't broken. Very worthy of an 8 or 9 despite wishing the game was something a bit different. In sum, best Halo and a fitting conclusion to make this series obsolete as this title needs to end so a fresh new series can be made.\"

The multi-player is extremely frustrating to me.  Granted, I am not the best, but it is just not consistent.  I may get 3 apparent headshots on an enemy only to be killed by one random shot, or worse yet a melee attack.  The next time, I shoot an enemy once and he is killed. I also don't understand the leveling up system...maybe I'm just used to COD and MW, but to me all of the Halo games look, play, and feel the same way.

To much is missing from the single player campaign. Not having played a Halo installation since the very first one i was curious to see what they would do to the last instance made by Bungie. On a side note i hope MS now that they have this lets this game die in peace. I think the first Halo felt like a complete game this just felt like i was running a bunch of little mini missions. I like to play a campaign before i jump into multi-player to get a feel for the kind of game i want to play in multi-player. There were times in the campaign where i just stood there thinking OK what do i do next for someone who hasn't played since the 90s it wasn't very intuitive. The game controls felt sloppy and didn't feel like a complete thought. The AI wasn't very intelligent unless your idea of intelligent was just run the opposite direction of me and the direction i need to go. Why do FPS always limit ammo of rocket launchers to two or three, seriously im firing plasma guns and shooting aliens and you mean to tell me i cant carry more then three rockets. Really, really now you want to be realistic i can jump from building to building and flip cars over with one button push but i cant hold more than three rockets. Also when i die i drop everything but the thing the surviving member needs to complete the mission so now in order to complete the mission we both have to die to go back and get the one thing you need to complete the mission.  In conclusion if you love Halo im sure you'll love this version if you aren't a Halo fan don't waste your time, and if you haven't played since the first one don't get to excited and maybe just stay away from the campaign and go straight to the multi-player. Something tells me the multi-player will feel like Unreal. This will be a perfect way to waste time until Black Ops with my bro-in law who happens to like Halo.

I started from the beginning again and went for a full play through and I gotta say, I didn't expect it to be that good (although after the surprise that ODST was I should have been prepared). Visually I was used to it after having played so much online, but it still was pretty and I always have loved the look of the Halo universe. It was interesting how this contrasted to the other off-main-series Halo game in that you weren't trying to find people but instead losing them throughout. The story was solid, not exactly memorable but a lot of fun along the way and you didn't really feel like you were doing stupid **** for the sake of playing a game. Recently I heard a distinction between Halo and most FPS's and I though it rang true in this game: Halo is not about who pulls the trigger faster but about individual engagements. I must have forgotten at some point what it was like to go into a battle feel like a vulnerable boss who can destroy everything if the strategy is right. So it was that style of combat, the great atmosphere, and the fantastic score that made this an awesome game and memorable as a whole. Oh, and the final scene was a nice touch too.\"
2010,Halo: Reach,"Halo: Reach is a rather interesting Halo game, as it actually goes back into the past to tell a story. Halo: Reach is set in 2552 on the UNSC's most protected planet, Reach.

The story follows Noble team, a group of SPARTAN III's trying to save Reach from certain doom. The main protagonist is Noble six, a hyper lethal assassin who has made entire militia groups dissapear. Noble six is a serious badass, but unlike the chief he openly engages in conversation. This adds more character development to Noble six than to Master chief, and thanks to Reach's armor customization he looks the part as well. Reach eventually is overrun, and the ending nearly makes you want to cry. Halo: Reach also has a unique multiplayer, and feels a lot like Halo: CE's split screen. Weapons have bloom, so players can't spam the trigger. For better or worse, Halo Reach adds a new feature in the form of armor abilities. These are basically retooled equipmen from Halo 3, and are a lot of fun to mess around with. Reach's maps are nicel constructed, and with community forge maps it feels like there are endless pla areas in Reach. The forge is also fantastic, and really improved upon Halo 3's basic editing. Halo Reach does lack a 1-50 system, but has 4 years worth of ranks to work at. Reach's multiplayer is definitely comparable to the other Halos, an has an addictive side to it.In conclusion, Reach i a fantastic Halo game. It's filled to the brim with content, and th possibilities with the forge are endless. If you haven't already, definitely go out and buy Halo: Reach, it's one of the best X-box 360 titles OU there.\"

Also you can get ranks and XP offline as well. There's massive character customisation too. If you can imagine changing your spartan or elite, you can do it, and you have to buy these things with XP.The graphics didn't come across as spectacular, but I was playing on a 46"" HDTV so any visual flaws were probably heightened.  Also I felt we could have done with some more MP maps, there aren't very many at the moment, and they are all bits from the campaign. Not as interesting as Halo 3's maps. Hope DLCs are on the way.Very fun. Overall much better than CoD: Black Ops. You're missing out, PS3 gamers.\"

The Reach online is fun don,t get me wrong but the level up system is ubelievably stupid. You rank up by credits and it doesn't matter if you win or lose. If you get in 8th place in every match you will still become the highest rank it will just take you longer. 3 you actually had to win matches to rank up.

But now, as a sterling star to guide through the night, Halo Reach has delivered. I'm not a big fan of the Halo series, or the CoD series, but I will say this is one of this years best FPS's. Reach delivers a tale of Noble squad, a group of Spartans ordered with protecting the planet Reach from the Covenant invasion. Of course, if you know your Halo lore you know how this story will end, but as a good person once told me, ""Sometimes it's about the journey to the end that matters most, not the ending itself."" And boy, what a journey. By the end of the game, you will feel like you've actually connected with the other Spartans of Noble, but then again character development still isn't that good. The ending is great, showcasing a feat of valor and sacrifice that tops off the Reach story greatly. An amazing feature is the ability to customize the look of your Spartan, for both single-player and multi-player. And multi-player now has armor abilities instead of powerups, like a jetpack or sprint ability, though the bubble-shield makes a cool appearance. If you like FPS's or any of the Halo games, this is for you.\"

2010,Halo: Reach,Reach is one of the top games of 2010 and will probably still be a top contender in 2011. Single player and multi player are top notch. I got it the first day and haven't taken it out of the disk drive. Probably won't until Fallout New Vegas  or Black Ops
2010,Halo: Reach,Never been a big fan of Halo to be honest - to me it's one of those franchises that everyone seems to love but I can't for the life of me understand why.  However - even I must admit that this one is pretty good.  Yes the campaign story is bloated and up it's own *** as usual - but there is absolutely no faulting the multiplayer - which is great fun I must say.
2010,Halo: Reach,This is a perfect game it combines all the good features and game play from the other halo games and adds more. Forge is amazing and you can make awesome maps with ease. The game has beautiful scenery. If you have an Xbox you must get this game you wont regret it.

Now you must assassinate them by holding down the melee button, but you will be a sitting duck while you finish the enemy off.

Firefight has expanded and now has many ways to customize how the weapons and rules of the fight. weapons have been slightly changed to balance out the game. The good ol' magnum from halo 1 is back. The DMR(long range rifle) has replaced the old black rifle. The game adds the revenant, a cross between a ghost and a wraith(replaced the chopper). The game adds the falcon, a giant helicopter that can carry your team(replaced  the hornet). New power-ups are now chosen just before the match starts and can be used any time in the match.Well, that's enough to give you the idea of the change. I could go on, but it would be pointless. The halo haters new ""thing"" with reach is to say it's the same ol' halo. Well, let me just say this is the biggest change in a halo game ever. It is so much more than halo 3 that it's amazing they didn't mess the game up. Don't get me wrong though. Halo fans will like the changes. WHY I GAVE IT A 9....There are two reasons I give halo a nine and not a ten.1. The single player didn't impress me. It reminded me of ODST's single player, which I didn't like.2.Some online glitches.

2010,Halo: Reach,"Before you read anything, you should know that I've played all of the Halo games (with the exception of ODST [who the hell wants to be an ODST over a SPARTAN?]), and quickly lost interest in Halo 3.That being said, while no game is perfect, Halo: Reach is as close as it gets.

All of the negative reviews that say the campaign is horrible, I ask ""why?"" Yes, it's a little short, but it tells a great story with some of the most memorable moments out of any Halo game - and since when have we bought Halo games for the campaign alone. The multiplayer is the real treat and that is where Reach delivers most. To all of the negative reviewers saying the gameplay feels dated, what did you expect? Call of Duty-style gameplay? And that's not to say that the gameplay is dated - it's Halo - the same Halo gameplay we've come to love over the years, with the addition of guns actually having accuracy, among a few other things. To call Reach's gameplay dated would be like saying MW2's gameplay feels dated in relation to MW - it's practically the same game (with a few additions), so of course the gameplay will be practically the same. And yes, all of the unlocks are for looks only, but I like that opposed to games like MW2 where people are at a great advantage over you just for being higher level than you, since they have more (if not all) of the guns, perks, and attachments unlocked. OMG ONE MAN ARMY, DANGER CLOSE, NINJA FTW! (not!). It gives people a much more level playing field. Some people want super-realism in their shooters (COD) and others want strategy and teamwork (Halo). I've gotten so burnt out on MW2 over the last year because of all of the hackers, modders, tenth prestige lobby spammers, not to mention the noob-tubers who kill you across the map without even trying. Yet in less than a month after this game came out, Bungie already banned 15k people for using a credit exploit. Compare that to the year that MW2 has been out and neither Infinity Ward nor Activision has done a damn thing about the hackers and modders that plague that game. At least Bungie cares about their community and the people who buy their games - Activision just wants your money, plain and simple.This game, as all Halo games, is also colorful - a welcomed break from the brown and green of your super-realistic shooters. Even some of the positive reviews say Reach's graphics are lacking, but I'd have to disagree with that as well. Anyone who says Reach's graphics look old are probably playing split-screen (which greatly hinders the graphics) and not full screen, in all its glory. This game supports something like four times the amount of polygons that Halo 3 did and twice as many particle effects that Halo 3 did. Or maybe people who say Reach's graphics are dated aren't playing on an HDTV, who knows.All I know is that if you've been a fan of Halo in the past, Reach is a must buy. If you haven't been a fan of Halo in the past, Reach probably won't impress you. But that's always how Halo has been - you either love it or you hate it.One last thing, to anyone saying that you're trading in Reach for Black Ops: Please do. Go enjoy your hacked/modded/noob-tube game with zero support from the developers. You won't be missed. Black Ops is also made by Treyarch, the geniuses who made the completely imbalanced, poor excuse for a COD game, World at War. Enjoy.\"
2010,Halo: Reach,"Designed to perfection. Sure, telling a story isn't exactly what Bungie are good at, and we've know this for a while now, but, Reach is a fantastic send-off to all the Halo fans that have been there since day one. The multiplayer alone is worth buying the game for. 360 owners are set for years."

I would like to start off saying that I am not basing this review on the originality of the game, I am basing it on how polished it is.  However, I will take in account how similar it is to past Halo games.And similar, it is not...at least not that much.  There are still much of the same weapons, but each redone, and a few newbies.  The winning gameplay formula is still present, but with a huge addition: armor abilities.  I cannot express how much it improves the gameplay; maybe not so much in the campaign, but a lot in the multiplayer.  It adds copious amounts of gameplay variation to come into play, and also improves the addiction factor.As far as campaign goes (clocking in at about 10 hours), it is Bungie's best attempt yet; capturing the feeling of being on a team and enveloping you in a story that is at some moments touching, and at others action-packed and just plain fun.  In fact, at some moments, I was so sad, that I cried...inside...not outside cause that would be weird.  With a beginning that sucks you in, and a perfectly crafted climax, this campaign is, by far, the best of the Halos.Unlike past Halo titles, this title does not suffer from the recycling of gameplay sequences; all are different.  There is not one place that is identical to another.  In fact, in one level, you come across a dance club that has been overrun by 9 or 10 hunters.  It was probably the best, if not funniest, gaming atmosphere I have ever been in.  Nevertheless, Halo Reach's campaign does have its shortcomings.  For instance, there are some frame-rate issues that can diminish some parts of the game.  It almost seems that the new graphics (and they are great) and what is happening can't keep up with the game's engine.  However, this does not really fade the overall experience.Apart from the campaign, there are numerous other game modes and and extras.  Some of them include Theater, Forge, Character Customization, Firefight, and On and Offline Multiplayer.  Theater is not unlike other Halo's, however it is easier to interact with.Forge is almost completely redone, featuring an expansive user-friendly interface, and a massive world made entirely for forge.Character customization is, again, completely redone.  You can customize any and every part of your spartan through the purchase of parts by credits, which you earn by doing anything at all, be it forge or campaign or multiplayer.  Also, your character model is present in both single and multi-player.Firefight has finally met its potential in Reach, featuring numerous options and modes.  Furthermore, there is a matchmaking option to firefight, which was absent in ODST.Finally, there is multiplayer which is the without-a-doubt the best in the series.  There is a lot more replayablity and strategy in this game than previous games.  The armor abilities really add that extra feature that was seemingly absent from Halo 3.  Furthermore, there is also a feature-filled stat tracker system that tracks any stat you could possibly imagine, be it from the campaign or the multiplayer.  It even shows your service record from previous games.Overall, this feature-rich, almost perfectly polished is a must-buy for Halo and multiplayer fans alike.  Besides the minor foul-ups, this game is well deserving of every bit of praise it has received and will be played for years to come.Graphics: 9.5 Once again, Bungie is at the apex of the Xbox graphics.Gameplay: 10 A winning gameplay formula is furthermore improved by armor abilities, among other things.Replayabilty: 9 As with all multiplayer games, it is infinately replayable.  However, the campaign is always better the first time.Story: 9.5 Involving, fun, well-paced, well-told, and a decent length.Presentation: 10 An innovative menu system further improves an otherwise, almost flawless presentation.And there it is, a Halo Reach review as told by a 16 year old.\"
2010,Halo: Reach,"Well in all honesty it won't change your opinion on halo it is really just another Halo game nothing to fancy here but the game plays well just as we have come to expect from Bungie.

2010,Halo: Reach,"Halo Reach Rocks...as good as any FPS on the market, but the lore is what makes the game so special.  I think Bungie ended their Halo days on their best note, and deliver one of the best game on the 360."
2010,Halo: Reach,"First things first. I love this game. In my personal opinion it it a solid 10 but I gave it an eight because Bungie made the game less forgiving for new players.

In my personal opinion it it a solid 10 but I gave it an eight because Bungie made the game less forgiving for new players. I am a huge Call of Duty fan but I must say Halo takes more skill to play. For instance there are no iron sights, you can't pistol head shot someone across the map (If you think you can't in call of duty, youtube it), you must take down shields before you can affect players health, all guns have bloom (ridicule gets larger as shots are fired in rapid succession) whether scoped or not, as well as other differences. This makes halo have a slight steeper learning curve than other brand name shooters on the market. This helps with strategy though. More experienced halo players have more strategies beyond the usual camping, shotgun rushing, etc. One i use is the four shot with the DMR weapon. It takes four shots to the body and one to the head to kill a person. Training yourself to aim for the body for the first three shots then to move to the head for the kill will give you a much higher K/D ratio versus the spamming of the trigger I see inexperienced players doing. The larger element of strategy coupled with the player's unfamiliarity with the halo series puts a lot of new gamers at a disadvantage and inevitably leads to bad reviews. Call of Duty has strategy too, but it comes in the form of customization. Having the counters to the other person's guns, killstreaks, perks, etc. Halo puts everyone on the same playing field and forces them to become better with same the guns the the enemy is using. In conclusion, if you a serious first person shooter gamer looking for a game that has a bit more strategy in the actual gun play rather than the in game customization then Halo Reach is a good buy.\"

I found no innovation in Halo Reach and everything in that game had been done in previous games as well.  As for the multiplayer, it is classic Halo.  It is fun, and I've gotta say, they've really outdone themselves.  The marketplace brings in a bigger sense of independence with your character and now with classes, you can find your own unique playing style.  It's great.  So if I had the choice, I would give this game an 8 and a half, but because that isn't an option it looks like a nine will have to suffice.\"

2010,Halo: Reach,"To say Halo: Reach lives up to expectations would be a dramatic understatement. It exceeds them. I thought Halo 3 was a relatively packed and deep game, but Reach has the kind of customization options and variables that change the game going for it, that it's almost like playing a PC game with access to mods. You can do anything, you can change anything, you can build anything. Seeing thatTo say Halo: Reach lives up to expectations would be a dramatic understatement. It exceeds them. I thought Halo 3 was a relatively packed and deep game, but Reach has the kind of customization options and variables that change the game going for it, that it's almost like playing a PC game with access to mods. You can do anything, you can change anything, you can build anything. Seeing that one of the developers made Pinnacle/Ascension from Halo 2 with the Forge World tools is impressive, but seeing the active community make The Pit, Hang 'Em High, Beaver Creek, other remade maps, and some mind-blowing original maps...it's astounding. Forge in Halo 3 was good, but there needed to be an excessive amount of time and a certain level of creative thinking to do something with it. Forge World on the other hand, is a brilliant canvas that can bring any of your ideas for a map to life without having to try too hard.Bungie makes Halo games to be played for years on end. That is literally the design goal for them. That goal has been achieved with every main series entry of Halo, and people will be playing Reach a long time from now. On the first day alone, 9 million games were played online. The changes to the ranking system allows players to enjoy the game and keep playing no matter what playlist or mode they are active in. The Commendations give those extra little goals to strive for, and the Challenges, weekly and daily, give players a reason to check in on the game whenever they can and always have something new to do. It's all the little things that count in making the online experience much deeper. Things like the Active Roster, things like being able to take three friends online with me for the ride, and things like sending out a Hologram that someone shoots at for three seconds before he realizes he's made an oops, and then I come behind him with my shotgun and deliver my fantastic chiropractic abilities at the end of the barrel.The campaign is great. Personally, I expected a bit more based around the events of the Fall of Reach, but what we got was good. Reach tells a story of war, and the sacrifice that comes with it. It starts out feeling very cookie cutter to be honest, but as it progresses, the overlying feeling of intensity increases. The set pieces aren't as epic as people who played the original trilogy may be used to. I remember so many moments from the campaigns in Combat Evolved, Halo 2, and Halo 3, and the only real lasting memories of Reach's campaign are the space battle (which was like another game in itself) and the ending. The last half of that campaign is gripping. The way it closes out is touching.But as always, what makes Halo above and beyond many other games and the king of it's genre, is the gameplay. The foundation Bungie struck gold with, a fusion of traditional shooter elements fighting over map control and fixed weapon spawns, combined with the unique weapons, physics, vehicles, map design, and new armor abilities. All the fixes the game needed from the beta have been made. Reach is every bit as accessible as the past Halo games. Bungie loads this game up with so much content. There is something for everyone if you are willing to take the time to find it, and everything for someone open-minded enough to appreciate quality game design. All of the new modes are fun. Team Stockpile and Team Headhunter is surprisingly intense and enjoyable. The new Arena playlist is groundbreaking and a genius idea. They have taken Halo, taken a few little qualities from other series and fused them without compromising the core of the game and the roots it was built upon. Halo: Reach is a fantastic example of how to keep something going. It isn't a franchise, it's a phenomenon.\"

2010,Halo: Reach,"I have been a long term Halo fan. I bought my first xbox many years ago and with that the original of the franchise 'Halo: Combat Evolved.' To my joy I found a deep, mysterious universe wrought with peril and a slightly (very) stereotyped space marine guy to play as while he swept over the ring, escaping from a terrible foe.Halo 2 came around, this time with multiplayer. Then Halo 3 withI have been a long term Halo fan. I bought my first xbox many years ago and with that the original of the franchise 'Halo: Combat Evolved.' To my joy I found a deep, mysterious universe wrought with peril and a slightly (very) stereotyped space marine guy to play as while he swept over the ring, escaping from a terrible foe.Halo 2 came around, this time with multiplayer. Then Halo 3 with innovative features such as Forge and Theater mode - both these games having campaigns that are still vivid in my mind and multiplayer maps so immersive that I can smell them. Oh, and there was that mediocre ODST game that brought firefight.Then Reach.To start with - campaign.The campaign was fun I guess, but not exactly difficult (even on legendary) but was overly short. The only characters to break out of the 'space marine' mould a little were Kat and Jorge. The story was mediocre, alien invasion with little real relevance to the overall story until the end.The Forge mode has seen a considerable increase in quality, the ability to nudge objects or to precisely adjust the angle is a huge move in the right direction for the mode. Phasing objects into the ground receives a huge thumbs up from me. Truly, this map editing mode is very, very good. However, it is marred by the restrictive colour palette of grey and... well, grey.Firefight has also seen an upgrade, with improved customisation options and matchmaking support, however, there is an insufferable lag whenever I play with anyone else (I have heard similar feedback from friends) so I normally end up playing on my own - kind of defeating the purpose of matchmaking support.The theater mode has sacrificed multiplayer support for the ability to rewind campaign footage.Finally, I move onto Matchmaking. I am so split over this, sometimes it works - in gametypes such as SWAT it feels fine but I can't help but feel frustrated when playing anything that isn't SWAT. The core of this comes down to a number of things - a bloom system that I don't feel belongs in Halo and very very very very very bad level design.To put the design in context, I can remember the names of many H: CE maps, yet after a month of not playing Reach, I can remember two. Paradiso - infamous with a one-sided spawn and annoying weapon locations and the imaginatively named 'Forge World', designed with guess what in mind?I don't think that Reach is essentially bad, and its not that I am bad at it - I had a k/d of 2 according to bungie.net over a few hundred games - but I found that I was getting very bored with Halo. Shooting a grunt's head with a DMR lost its appeal quickly, sticks and splatters were made redundant with armour  and I was generally bored of the game very quickly compared to other Halo games.Finally, I come onto custom games - where I spent weeks of my life in Halo 3. This to me was the core of the fun, with many community favourites such as a jenga tower variant where you had to stand on a tower as large chunks of scenery were fired at you - last man standing wins. These games normally racked up around 8 people, but many times went up to the max of 16. Meanwhile, I go onto Reach, set up a variant where you have to run down a track from a killball chasing you, get positive reviews when I show people one on one and then invite my friends list for a good, full game. Not one person joins. Why? Because you only get 200 credits for playing 10 minutes of custom games, while you can get 2000 for an enraging matchmaking game. Effectively, credits have destroyed custom games.To sum up, the campaign and the multiplayer are average -  while the firefight, forge and custom games are all absolutely fantastic, best in the console FPS genre, however, these are made redundant from a lack of players who are too busy annoying themselves getting virtual money to spend on virtual clothes for a virtual character. Halo just outsmarted itself.\"

2010,Halo: Reach,"Halo: Reach is a true successor to the Halo Trilogy. Though not quite as awesome as Halo 3, it is still very well done and worth playing for anyone who regularly plays shooters.    The storyline is one of the series' best, but for quite a different reason then you'd expect; set in the weeks before the beginning of Halo: Combat Evolved, Halo: Reach covers the stories of Noble Team, an elite task force of SPARTANS who help defend the planet during its siege at the hands of the merciless Covenant. Unlike that of the Master Chief in the original trilogy, the personalities of these characters are given likenesses and then fleshed out. This provides the main weight of the story, as anyone who has even heard of Halo has some idea that Reach is glassed by the Covenant at the end of that battle, and everyone on the surface is killed. The story does provide some small hopes for victory, but they are all eventually dashed. Ultimately, it is the realization that none of the main characters survive the game that sets the deep tone for the game's storyline.    The gameplay is for the most part the same as that of the first three Halo games, but some tweaks, such as the new timing aim mechanic, help to keep the shot-by-shot gameplay from getting stale. There are also armor abilities, special defenses with a recharge that can turn the tables of any situation, or even an entire match, if used properly. Overall, the base of the gameplay is the same, just with a lot more depth.    This game has more content than any I have played before. The campaign is quite short at just seven or so hours on the first time through, but its reply value on higher difficulty settings keeps it fresh. There is also the revamped Firefight mode, where in the pre-game menu you can set everything from the strengths of players to the types of enemies you face. Multiplayer has the bulk of the content, however. Ditching the skill based ranking system of previous installments, the multiplayer for Reach is instead now entirely experienced based and allows you to use that experience to purchase cosmetic armor upgrades. This is a very good idea, as it provides a much better incentive to keep playing then the simple hope of increasing your rank that the previous games had.    Reach is a must buy. Basically everything about it has been improved to the point of near perfection. The only complaints I have about it are the semi-rechargeable health bar that requires med kits, and the fact that armor upgrades are purely cosmetic despite their deceptively detailed descriptions, but these are only very minor annoyances. With more quality and content than any other game can boast to have (with the single exception of Halo 3), Reach is a deal that no sane shooter gamer can refuse.\"

I also didn't like the fact that some very simple achievements on the DLC would give you 75 pts each, which is more than most on the game itself, it is a clear gimmick. But the DLC now!Overall: I enjoyed this game, but some of the achievements were soooooooo time consuming it was irritating, its not just beating the game over...its investing hours and hours and hours into leveling up to Captain and Colonel. Fun game for a while, MP got boring quick, I smoke people and get 50 pts performance bonus, I do crappy and get 300. Well whatever, best Halo yet.\"

The let downs are the campaign missions which to be frank are mainly at their best firefights where one side exchanges fire with another. Sure firefight is back but to me it's just the same as last time with a few armour abilities like Sprint or Jet Pack. The main new feature that stood out for me was the levelling system which took place in SP and MP where the aim is to get credits for anything like kill an enemy or finish a level. With these newly acquired credits, armour can be bought to customize your Spartan. Overall a game I often play but it has it's let downs.\"

2010,Mass Effect 2,"RPG? ---  I don't get it... I just don't. How could this game have received a 9.0 user score? It must be because the current generation of gamers is made-up of FPS f-boys who care more about ownz and lolz, than a deep RPG experience. Mass Effect 2 isn't an RPG.. it doesn't even have elements of an RPG. The only thing that had RPG elements in ME2 was the marketing letterhead. ME2 was a third person shooter in space. Period. None of your choices matter or make any difference to the story line, except who is or is not around after the credits roll. Big woop.Completely linear gameplay -- huge disapointment throughout the entire experience. Side-missions are nothing more than 10 minute long fire fights, without any purpose. No loot, no weapons or armor to find, no unique artifacts.... just more fps lolz and ownz.Mining -- makes me so sick I don't even want to write about it. Bioware took away immersive planet exploration in an awesome all terrain vehicle.... for a glorified game of darts. Congrats developers. You epic failed. All you had to do was add some more alien villages, or interesting ruins to explore. Instead, you Bioware typed select-all, Shift-delete. ""We're golden yo!"" I've met smarter rocks.PS - to the people who complained about ME1's planet exploring vehicle controls -- you're just too dumb. Sorry. The controls worked perfectly, and exploring the mountains of a distant world was great fun. Try learning how to control a vehicle other than a Halo Bullfrog buggy... or whatever it's called.Inventory - Shift-Delete.Armor, Weapons - Shift-Delete....a new bioware trend.Finally... the final Boss....

In space???  How was this thing supposed to do anything, go anywhere, or simply be a threat to anyhing in the ME2 universe? Was he going to fling asteroids across known space?Oh, and the best part was that he was made from a mix of biological DNA.... so he was the giant mutated baby of Rosanne Bar and Shaq??

A lot of the skills from the original Mass Effect were removed. They also scrapped planet exploration, which was a bit flawed but could have been great, had they improved on it. Instead it was replaced by a repetitive planet scanning mini-game. Sadly, the main plot also falls short.

Lair of the Shadow Broker was incredible, and the other DLC was fun too. Overall this game is the complete package, and a good sequel always surpasses the original. Mass Effect 2 does just that.\"

Mass Effect 2 takes place in an established universe, so it won't have the same amount of detail to every encounter as in the first ME game. That does nothing to tamper with the game's overall quality, as new races, factions and lots of characters are introduced. There are a huge amount of variables being counted in through player choices throughout the game. This is my favorite RPG of all time, because my Mass Effect game is unlike yours or any others.\"
2010,Mass Effect 2,"Mass Effect 2 is the second game in the brilliant Mass Effect series, and boy does it not disappoint.

At the time of this review, I am about a quarter way through Mass Effect 3 and Mass Effect 2 is by far my favorite game of the franchise. It\s characters are relatable and charming and the story and world is a blast to travel through, although it does feel extremely linear despite being open world.Yes, the missions and the planets are still very cramped, the combat is still mediocre (yet much better than in the first game), and for some reason skill trees/customization has been downplayed in ME 2, but none of this matters when compared to the story and characters as a whole. The game starts with the Normandy being destroyed and Commander Shepard being rebuilt for two whole years, which first feels annoying because that seems like a way to make your decisions in the first Mass Effect have minimal effect but I eventually realized that this was for the best of the plot.This time you\re working for Cerberus instead of the Alliance. Cerberus is an organization commonly misidentified as human-only terrorists who need Shepard to protect human colonies  from a new enemy known as collectors. Combat has been refined (yet is still boring), the god-awful autosave has been fixed and the dreadful Mako moments have been removed. It\s a real big shame that each loyalty mission (missions in which you gain the loyalty of a character so they aren\t distracted in the final mission) and story mission have to include combat because it\s really sluggish and isn\t innovative. Of course, I understand why it is there because otherwise there would be no core gameplay, but that\s all there is to combat in ME 2: to be filler in-between story moments.You go around recruiting new characters and learning about their lives, as well as bumping into (and recruiting a few) ME 1 characters. There are also a lot of side missions and depending on your ending you may be able to continue playing after completing the game which was a smart decision by the developers. Unfortunately, unlike in the first Mass Effect, you cannot become friends with romance-able characters- you either romance them or turn them down.The only major issue I have with this game outside of the combat is the lack of direction in some cases. The game never tells you that upgrading your ship is important however that has major effects in the final mission. As well as that, it doesn\t tell you that to upgrade your ship you\re gonna have to scout other planets for resources. In other words, I wasn\t upgrading my ship or scouting planets until right before the final mission when I realized how important this was.Mass Effect 2 is  captivating, interesting, and makes you care so much for the characters (specifically Mordin, who is so funny). Sure, this game has its downfalls, but nevertheless it is an excellent game and you\d do yourself a disfavor if you didn\t play it (but make sure you play the first game before, or else you aren\t getting the full experience).Full Score: 9.5/10You can also check out my second opinion at: http://binarymessiah.wordpress.com/2013/06/08/mass-effect-2-910/\"
2010,Mass Effect 2,"In my opinion, this is the BEST GAME EVER MADE. It is so perfect, I felt like I had complete control at the end(unlike in 3), I was a sucker for side quests and it actually paid off! I loved it so much, it felt like the perfect adventure, every part of it was an awesome twist or an action sequence. It was awesome."

People will say that it lost too much of the RPG element, but I believe that it combines the RPG element and adds more shooter elements perfectly. The characters are still amazing, the story is even better than before, and the combat is the best ever. The game got rid of the annoying equipment menu in favor for a load out you select before starting a mission. While it was nice to select different weapons mid mission, the fact that that menu is gone is a plus. Speaking of equipment, without DLC's, the weapon selection is bare at best. The enemy is even tougher than before, and the final suicide mission is epic to say the least. To elaborate on the characters a bit more, they add more characters with even more depth, and you're able to meet up with a few of your friends from the last game. The loyalty missions are a vast improvement from the first game, and the dialogue is still one of the best features of the game. The cover system was fixed thankfully and makes combat much more fluid. As far as the story based DLC's are concerned, they are good and add to the story, and while I agree that they should have been in the main game from the start, they are worth the money.Overall, it is the best game in the trilogy and has minimal drawbacks that don't detract from the 10/10 score.\"
2010,Mass Effect 2,"This game is excellent. Way better than the previous game in the trilogy. Boasting new characters, improved gunplay, removed annoying crap from ME1, a very well done and engaging story, and very meaningful choices. Mass Effect 2 just all comes together to deliver an experience you won't forget for a long while."
2010,Mass Effect 2,"They've done it again, sadly this time, no Mako backseat alien boning, but the essentials are still here, green shafts, blue labias, this game has it all and more. Sure wish I could give this 11/10 because you Metacritic **** can go all the way to 100!"
2010,Mass Effect 2,"This game gets it right. Both Mass Effect 1 and 2 are remarkable, yet they are extremely different.

Without spoiling anything, Mass Effect 2 has one of the most memorable openings to a game ever.Mass Effect 2 makes its amazing original look really simple. Whether you're eavesdropping on a pair of Krogans in The (New) Citadel, mining planets for resources from space, or outfitting your private quarters with a fish tank and a space hamster, almost every area in the game is improved upon and impressively presented. It really does feel as if BioWare compiled a big checklist of the first game's bad points, and scratched them off one by one. Rubbish vehicle sections, overwhelming inventory management and, yes, elevator load times have all been thrown in the bin. The result is a more balanced and approachable game - arguably BioWare's best to date.The game is fully deservant of it's reputation as ""The Avatar of video games except it's better written better!"" and has earned countless perfect scores in the process! This is not only Bioware's greatest game, it's not even only the game of the year but it might be the greatest game of the decade!\"
2010,Mass Effect 2,"The game was fantastic, and a great blend of action and RPG elements.  Even without importin a save game from the first game, I was sucked into this one and thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish.  Starting a second playthrough, this time with an imported game to see some of the things I missed."
