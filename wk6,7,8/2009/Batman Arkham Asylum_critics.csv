"GameSpy","100","This action-adventure is so smart, so well-written, and delivered with such an obvious love for its source material, I daresay it is both the best licensed game ever made, and arguably the best game of its kind in our current console generation."
"ZTGD","100","One of those games that comes along every few years that will have gamers talking about it long into the future. It is this year's BioShock, and I for one could not put it down from start to finish. If you enjoy great narrative, interesting boss encounters, fresh gameplay and of course everyone's favorite detective then Arkham Asylum will not disappoint."
"Gaming Age","100","It's excellent in nearly every aspect, and certainly one of the best games you'll play this year, let alone the best licensed game I've ever played (sorry Riddick). If you've been on the fence about this one, I highly suggest you pick it up, there's nothing here that'll disappoint, and like I mentioned, the gameplay is so great that you don't need to be a Batman fan to appreciate how great the gameplay is."
"The A.V. Club","100","The game also feels decidedly adult; it’s unafraid to take dark turns. The writing and themes become unexpectedly morbid in later stages. It’s obvious that Arkham was created with reverence, genuine craft, and love. There’s a rare, considered quality behind everything on the disc, which makes this an absolute must-play."
"Impulsegamer","100","Batman: Arkham Asylum is the ultimate Batman experience, hands down."
"Giant Bomb","100","This is a full-on experience devoted to all of the different facets of being Batman, from the gadgets that help him along, to striking fear in the hearts of his opponents by carefully lurking in the shadows, to taking challenges head-on with little more than his feet and his fists, to straight-up acting like a detective, hunting around for clues. This all translates into an adventure full of variety, with each different aspect coming in at such a high level of quality that it just keeps impressing you over and over again, right up to its final moments."
"Cynamite","100","Batman's trip to the asylum has hardly any flaws. The controls fit perfectly and the missions will entertain you every second you play this game. Buy it, play it, love it."
"DarkZero","100","Rocksteady have proven that they’re a company that really care. They actually ‘get’ Batman, they’ve looked at the character from every conceivable angle and strived to make this everything anybody could possibly want from a Batman game."
"GameFocus","98","The grim set-up mixed an incredible voice-over work and great storytelling makes of Batman: Arkham Asylum, not only the best Batman game ever published but also the best comic-book/superhero videogame so far and a very serious “Game of the Year” contender."
"MEGamers","97","Batman: Arkham Asylum is not just the best comic game ever, the game actually managed to rank high in our best games of all time list.  Whichever system you own and regardless of your gaming budget, the Dark Knight’s latest adventure is not one to be missed."
"Games Master UK","96","Arkham Asylum is a game with the power to utterly captivate you and can stand proudly alongside modern classics such as ""Resident Evil 4"", ""Gears of War,"" and ""BioShock""...Simply put, Batman: Arkham Asylum is a masterpiece. [Sept 2009, p.66]"
"AtomicGamer","96","Minor gripes aside, Arkham Asylum is a remarkable achievement both in design and in finally giving Bat fans the game they've been waiting for."
"Game Informer","95","Batman: Arkham Asylum is this year's ""BioShock,"" not just from the connection established with the world, but from its ability to innovate where new ideas are needed, and moreover, deliver an adventure unlike any other. [Sept 2009, p.82]"
"Xbox World 360 Magazine UK","95","A massively impressive licensed game. Without a license holding it all together Arkham Asylum would have been a stunning game with striking features. That it's all wrapped up in Batman's world makes the experience so much more appealing, and it works both as an extension of lore for Batman enthusiasts and an entry point for those less familiar with the DC universe. [Oct 2009, p.84]"
"GameWatcher","95","Rewarding and engrossing in equal measure, the entire production reeks of quality from the stellar voice work to the jaw-dropping visuals and intuitive control system. Truly this is the Batman game that everybody’s been waiting for."
"BigPond GameArena","95","It combines the best features of any superhero series with fantastic graphics, solid gameplay and outstanding voice acting. The minor flaws - the easy gameplay, the initially confusing layout of Arkham and the occasional loading time hitch - are all negated a dozen times over by the game's character, atmosphere and attention to detail."
"Everyeye.it","95","Batman: Arkham Asylum is simply the best action game of 2009. Rocksteady Studios Production features an outstanding gameplay, a mature and involving storytelling and an astonishing graphic. It's a Must Buy without compromise."
"Worth Playing","95","Fans of the franchise owe it to themselves to pick it up, and anyone with a hankering for a high-quality action game will find Arkham Asylum to be just what the doctor ordered."
"Gamervision","95","A phenomenal achievement, and I can’t wait to see what Rocksteady has in store next—personally, I’m hoping for a sequel set in Gotham City. Arkham Asylum is the kind of game you can’t stop playing, yet don’t ever want to end; it was almost a shame to have to review it, because I really wanted to take my time and enjoy every inch of Arkham Island."
"Extreme Gamer","95","With the beauty of this game, the amazing sound, script and voice-acting, this is definitely one game you would be –ahem- batty to not buy."
"GameZone","95","There is not a single-element of the Batman that this game doesn't nail, from the gadgets to the atmosphere and the combat. The action is thrilling and varied, and even the fetch quests are compelling."
"WonderwallWeb","95","Not only is Batman Arkham Asylum the best superhero game ever made but it could also content with some of this years big hitters for game of the year. A must buy."
"PGNx Media","94","Batman: Arkham Asylum would be a terrific third-person action game on its own thanks to the excellent combat engine and well-designed levels. But coupled with the Batman license the game becomes a must-play."
"Play.tm","94","The entire production reeks of quality from the stellar voice work to the jaw-dropping visuals and intuitive control system - truly this is the Batman game we've all been waiting for. It is to games what ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight"" are to movies - Batman: Arkham Asylum is without doubt the most definitive videogame realisation of the character yet. It's also unreservedly brilliant to boot."
"HellBored","94","Favouring the animation series over the movie for setting was an inspired choice, and the depth of detail and maximum use of the source material make this a game that will remembered for a long time."
"Xbox Achievements","93","This is certainly not a game for just Batman fans, comic fans or action fans; this is a game that everyone should play and thoroughly enjoy. It looks beautiful, plays like a dream and has a superb mix of action, stealth and detective elements. The combat is intuitive, flexible and surprisingly deep too. Give this game a go and you will not be pleasantly surprise, you will be blown away."
"IGN","93","The greatest comic book videogame of all time. This is an adult Dark Knight story that is well-told, packs some truly fun gameplay elements, has topnotch voice talent, and feel like it's part of Batman cannon."
"MondoXbox","93","Batman: Arkham Asylum has been a real surprise, delivering us a great action game, with a deep stealth/tactical gameplay, great loyalty to the original comics and a strong plot. Undoubtedly the best comics-based video game so far, and one of the best games released this year: a real milestone."
"XboxAddict","93","So much detail has been given to the game; graphically, sound, and even how Batman’s cape flows and becomes mangled throughout the engaging story that will take roughly around 10 hours or so to complete the first time."
"Gamer 2.0","93","Without a doubt, Arkham Asylum is one of the best games of the year, and from the solid single player experience, amazing voice acting, rewarding challenge maps and a slew of nearly dozens of unlockable bios and collectibles, any fan will be hard-pressed to not give this game a try."
"Talk Xbox","93","Overall, Batman: Arkham Asylum is a fantastic, exceptional, and an extravagant video game, and revitalizes both the comic-book and Batman video game based genres."
"Computer and Video Games","92","Massively polished, hugely enjoyable single-player game that (finally) does the Batman license justice."
"Cheat Code Central","92","With a massive world to search, an easy to adjust combat system, stealth action, audio logs to find, and challenges galore, Batman has finally come into his own in this medium. There are so many extra things and enjoyable moments in Arkham Asylum for fans and newcomers alike, you'll be glad you are a fan of Batman and video games."
"IGN UK","92","It’s hugely atmospheric and engrossing, its blend of combat and stealth balanced superbly to deliver an experience that’s easily as engaging as the Metal Gear series."
"ActionTrip","92","Rocksteady Studios damn-nearly astonished us with this one. We expected it to be a decent summer action game. In all fairness, we never expected it to be this much fun. Batman: Arkham Asylum outshines every game we've seen this year (so far)."
"Vandal","92","It is not only the best Batman game ever, but also one of the best action titles of the year."
"Planet Xbox 360","92","The longevity of Batman: AA is tremendously astounding as a single-player only title."
"1UP","91","That's Batman's general theme: so many of the mechanics turn Batman: Arkham Asylum into a bona fide ""Batman Simulator,"" that the feeling of being Batman compensates for its flaws."
"TeamXbox","91","Between the Story Mode, Challenge Rooms and myriad hidden items (that are more compelling than in most games), there’s a lot of entertainment in Arkham Asylum."
"Game Revolution","91","With fantastic voice acting, gorgeous graphics, and a well-written plot, what else could you want from a game? Great for hardcore Batmaniacs as well as gamers looking for a solid action/adventure game, I'm happy to declare Batman: Arkham Asylum as the best Batman game ever."
"Gamers.at","91","The gameplay is diversified, the graphics are great and the combat-system is one of the best we have ever encountered. Batman: Arkham Asylum is a definite ""Must-Have"" on any platform and more then worthy to wear the famous name of The Dark Knight and Worlds greatest detective."
"SpazioGames","90","Batman Arkham Asylum is a product of absolute value that can count on a cast of colorful characters to build a great game, really fun. The greatest strengths of the production lie in the gameplay built around what are the real capabilities of Batman, mixing action and stealth section, but always related with the universe from which have been extrapolated. Rocksteady's game  is certainly the new standard for understanding how  produce games under license, adapting for videogaming the very spirit of this historic character."
"Official Xbox Magazine","90","Impeccable presentation from top to bottom. [Nov 2009, p.82]"
"Multiplayer.it","90","It would be too easy, if not unfair, to consider this game as just the tie in you don't expect. Batman AA is one of the best action adventure you can play in this generation of hardware, mixing in an almost impeccable way the best elements taken from this genre's masterpieces."
"GamingXP","90","A really good game with amazing graphics and a deep story! Not only for fans of the ""Batman"" universe."
"Kikizo","90","Arkham Asylum is the kind of eventual coming-to-form which renders years of half-arsed franchise transplantation not just forgivable, but worthwhile."
"Eurogamer","90","Fans of the caped crusader really shouldn't hesitate - this isn't just the best grown-up Batman game, it's the best superhero game, bar none."
"GamesRadar+","90","Not only a brilliantly authentic presentation of its subject matter but a tremendous game in its own right, Batman: Arkham Asylum is a big, clever and finely crafted experience which propels Rocksteady immediately into the realm of triple-A developers. This year's BioShock. That's what it is."
"Official Xbox Magazine UK","90","A brilliant experience. No other license-shackled developer has understood their subject quite as well as Rocksteady, and this is without a doubt the definitive representation of the Dark Knight."
"NZGamer","90","As well as being wonderfully constructed, the environment drips with atmosphere."
"GameDaily","90","The result is so good that we're declaring it an easy 'Best of' contender for 2009."
"GameSpot","90","Regardless of whether you're getting sucked into the Story mode or competing for high scores in the Challenge mode, Batman: Arkham Asylum does an outstanding job of letting you be Batman. Everything about this game--the impressive visuals, stirring soundtrack, superb voice acting, fiendish puzzles, hard-hitting combat--feels like it has been lovingly crafted by a development team that's both knowledgeable and passionate about the source material."
"Eurogamer Spain","90","Arkham Asylum is not just the greatest game ever made about the Dark Knight, it might be the best superhero game yet."
"Eurogamer Italy","90","Batman: Arkham Asylum is a top quality game, the best one to celebrate the Dark Knight in a long time. You'll love it even if you don't like the character. If Batman is the reason you live, you can't ask for anything better."
"Telegraph","90","With a series of combat and stealth challenge rooms with online leader boards rounding off the package, Arkham Asylum is a brilliantly polished and wholly engrossing prospect. Few licensed titles have captured so authentically and completely the ethos of its inspiration as Arkham Asylum."
"Play Magazine","90","There isn’t a single element of Arkham Asylum that isn’t polished to the utmost degree."
"Gamer Limit","90","My absolute favorite aspect of Arkham Asylum has to be its boss fights."
"VideoGamer","90","Whether you fancy skulking in the shadows, smashing slow motion fists in into a goon's skull, or simply using some cool gadgets, you can do no wrong with what is Eidos' best game in years."
"Gameplayer Sweden","90","Batman Arkham Asylum is by far the biggest surprise this year. This is not only a great game based on a license, this is one of the top titles this year. Rocksteady has put everything that's cool with Batman and his villains in this game, and it all works astonishingly. However, this epic tale is surprisingly over before you know it, not only because it's a short game, but also because you're having so much fun while playing it."
"GamerNode","90","This is the must-have Batman game of all-time and a great third-person action game. Whether you're a fan or just looking for a solid game, you should pick this up. You will not be dissappointed."
"Wired","90","This should serve as a reminder that a strong license shouldn’t be a millstone around a game designer’s neck but a gold mine, a vast stockpile of prebuilt characters and relationships that, properly tweaked, can work just as well in a videogame as they do in a movie or comic book series."
"Gamestyle","90","Simply put, you have to play Batman: Arkham Asylum to be reminded why you love games in the first place."
"RealGamer","90","This is not only one of the best superhero games ever, but one the best action games I’ve played in a long time. A definite contender for game of the year with the Dark Knight detective at his best."
"Game Over Online","90","While it’s slightly hurt by a few minor problems, Batman: Arkham Asylum rises above them to provide an unforgettable experience. Part of it is due to the well-crafted storyline, but it’s also due to the well-made gameplay that makes most things easy to do and certainly more than any Batman game released in the last 15 years."
"Gamer.nl","90","Batman: Arkham Asylum isn't just for the fans: it delivers a great experience to all lovers of action games. The game effortlessly combines puzzle-, stealth- and fighting-elements. Arkham Asykum sets the new standard for future licensed games."
"PALGN","90","Batman: Arkham Asylum successfully blends action, stealth and the Batman universe to create what is arguably the best comic book game ever made. Don't miss it."
"XGN","90","Normally you just want to avoid an asylum. But Batman's Arkham Asylum is one you just want to explore. Never before was it so much fun to fight with a bat!"
"Console Monster","90","Aside from those small niggles, Batman Arkham Asylum is not only a stellar example of how superhero games can work but also with narrative as a whole."
"AceGamez","90","Rocksteady really have delivered here in the authenticity stakes. The game is entirely self-referential, with lots of fan-baiting namedrops and a slew of villain profiles and inmate recordings to be found, you will be on fanboy cloud nine here."
"3DJuegos","89","Batman: Arkham Asylum is a massive triumph: Action, stealth and investigation as its best. The best videogame based on Bob Kane’s composition, and the best superhero game this far too. A brilliant work that drives Rocksteady to the highest rank of developers."
"My Gamer","88","What may be one of Batman’s worst nights of his life may end up being one of many players’ best experiences of the year."
"InsideGamer.nl","88","Batman proves himself in this fantastic game. It is more then a good license game, it is a must have!"
"IGN AU","87","A rare breed of game. Not only is it a licensed title that really makes the most of the license, with gameplay mechanics that cater to Batman’s character, a compelling setting and story, and a host of well-known characters, it’s also a very polished product. You can tell that a whole lot of love has gone into this one."
"Gameplanet","85","The stealth portions are somewhat simple in execution but satisfying when you get it right. When you are high above the enemy scoping them out in order to plan your attacks you really do feel like Batman."
"MS Xbox World","85","A worthy and worthwhile purchase if there ever was one during the closing moments of the Summer."
"X-ONE Magazine UK","80","A well-made and mostly fun interpretation of hte Batman universe, Arkham Asylum lacks evolution and can wear thin, but it stands up admirably in a very competitive genre. [Issue#50, p.84]"
"GamePro","80","Batman: Arkham Asylum doesn't quite deliver on all of its big ideas, and thus dodges the highest of accolades, but its rousing peaks make its low points more than bearable. Its best moments of dazzling showmanship easily qualify as must-see entertainment, even if they're not sufficient to make the game as a whole a must-play."
"Total Video Games","80","It triumphs where most other superhero games and other types of licensed action games fail: it makes you feel like the lead character. It makes you feel like The Batman."
