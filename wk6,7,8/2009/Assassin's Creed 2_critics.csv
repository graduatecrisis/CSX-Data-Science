"GamePro","100","Few games so deftly balance the contrasting qualities achieved here. It's at once both epic and intimate, earnest and lighthearted. The scale of it is truly magnificent, but often its largest and most moving moments come from the smallest and most carefully composed scenes."
"Cynamite","100","Assassin's Creed 2 manages to surpass its predecessor in almost every way."
"GamesRadar+","100","A huge improvement over the first game, Assassin’s Creed II offers up an enormous, beautiful open world that’s easy to get lost in, an epic storyline and all the fun that comes from creatively killing villains and tearing across 15th-century rooftops at ridiculous speeds."
"GameSpy","100","Fantastic narrative aside, the most important thing to know about AC2 is that it won't make you want to throw your controller through your TV like the first game did."
"The A.V. Club","100","Ezio feels complex and human. This virtual version of Florence feels vital and real. From the ashes of the overwrought, flawed original comes one of the few videogames that truly qualifies as an adult, mature experience."
"GamerNode","100","ACII so satisfyingly delivers upon every aspect first laid out in its prequel, as well as many new gameplay elements and non-gameplay additions that transcend the medium, that it is difficult to offer anything but praise for this superb title."
"Gaming Age","100","It's a fantastic follow-up, probably one of the best sequels you'll ever play, one that actually takes the complaints of the first game and improves upon them tenfold."
"Extreme Gamer","98","Assassin’s Creed II is a worthy successor of one the most intriguing new franchises we have seen in a long time."
"GameFocus","98","I couldn’t be more pleased at the progress that Ubi Montreal made and the completely unabashed way they took the criticism to heart of the first AC. They’ve lovingly crafted a set of gameplay systems that not only improved on their first entry, but also rendered it completely obsolete. The game learned from its mistakes the first time around and fought its way back to the top of the pile."
"Impulsegamer","97","In conclusion, Assassin's Creed II is a worthy successor and goes beyond the original game with a very interesting story and some almost perfect gameplay."
"GamingExcellence","97","Assassin’s Creed II is one of those few games that manage to be both intimate and epic."
"3DJuegos","96","Assassin’s Creed II is a gem, a truly masterpiece. Developing a new economic system, and bringing more attention to combats, notoriety and context-script, Ubisoft achieves an awesome and epic experience. This sequel is far better than the first one."
"ZTGD","96","I admit the first 30 minutes of the game feel really slow and disappointing, but once you move past that it easily becomes one of the best games I have played this year."
"Gamer 2.0","96","The Italian countryside was a perfect fit in both design and gameplay and many of the new features should keep fans entertained for quite a while.  You simply could not have asked for a better addition to the Assassin’s Creed franchise."
"Everyeye.it","95","Assassin's Creed 2 is miles away form the first chapter. It's a whole new game, different in many aspects. The main quest is involving and nice to play, and the number of side mission and extra activities is impressive (and all of them are fun to play). The setting is peculiar and unique, and the panoramic views are sharp and, somehow, magic."
"Game Informer","95","Assassin’s Creed II is a complex, mature, and engaging journey from beginning to end. It stands as a benchmark for design that combines innovative ideas with tried-and-true techniques to create one of the great games of this generation."
"TeamXbox","95","A game that takes the free-running and huge cityscapes of its predecessor and adds in a host of action-RPG elements that combine to form a much deeper and more satisfying game, and a surprise frontrunner for the best of 2009."
"Gamer Limit","95","Assassin's Creed II is a vast improvement upon its predecessor, and it delivers an engaging narrative with a heap of longevity."
"WonderwallWeb","95","A huge improvement over the original, every element has been looked at and worked on making it a joy to play. Another must have top title."
"Xbox Achievements","95","Assassin’s Creed 2 does exactly what we want a sequel to do. It improves on the original vastly and corrects all the errors, it adds a ton more depth and content, yet it still manages to encapsulate the charm of the original."
"GameWatcher","95","Not only an unreservedly brilliant and compelling follow-up, but one of the finest games we’ve ever played. Boasting a suitably grand soundtrack, majestic aesthetics and masterful level design, Assassin’s Creed II is everything we could have ever wished for and so much more. Forget Modern Warfare 2, Assassin’s Creed II is without a doubt this year’s biggest and best."
"Totally360","95","You can tell that Ubisoft put an incredible amount of work into this title and the development team should be proud of what they accomplished."
"Kombo","95","Assassin's Creed 2 is an amazing sequel. It outclasses the original in almost every way, but in doing so only enhanced my appreciation for the original game and the foundation it provided."
"Game Over Online","95","The bottom line here is that Assassin’s Creed 2 is one of the best games of this year or any other, period. The first game was great in its own right and this one is better in almost every way. Even the finale is brilliant in how it provides a satisfying conclusion to this chapter while dropping huge bombshells that demand the series continue. This is a gamer’s game from start to finish, and if you don’t like it you might need to consider a new hobby."
"Computer and Video Games","94","A massive, brilliant sequel that one-ups the original in almost every way."
"Vandal","94","With a more complete story, much more varied gameplay and the same virtues than the original, Ezio's adventures in the Renaissance will captivate everyone this time."
"Play.tm","94","Despite the original Assassin's Creed's less than well hidden inadequacies, we were bowled over by the sheer ambition of the title, the daring of the setting, plot and characterisation. That this sequel goes along way to addressing many of the previous gameplay concerns, while expanding on what made the first release such a wonderful slice of escapism, leaves us convinced that Ubisoft really are building a truly vital franchise that this sequel is a pivotal part of."
"Planet Xbox 360","94","Everything about Assassin’s Creed II screams believability, from the real life characters that you interact with to the conflict – it plays out as though direct from the history books. More than once while playing this game did I get that feeling of “this is why I love to play video games” and “it’s one of the best titles of 2009.”"
"MEGamers","94","It’s very darn close to perfection."
"InsideGamer.nl","93","Forget Jerusalem and forget Altaïr. Ezio's adventure in Renaissance Italy is better in every aspect! Both Florence and Venice are enormous living cities with an fantastic atmosphere, and even the smaller cities are wonderful to walk and climb through. There is only one big rotten apple: Italy's wonderful capital city Rome is the smallest location in the entire game."
"GamesNation","93","What happens when a dev team listens carefully to all the feedback they got from the community? Something amazing like Assassin's Creed 2! This game is so much more thorough than its predecessor, and it has so much on offer that you’ll never want it to end!"
"Gamervision","93","Assassin’s Creed II isn’t just a step forward for the series, it’s a leap. The improvements are immediately obvious, and it isn’t a stretch to say that Assassin’s Creed II feels like a game two or three sequels away instead of one that was just two years from the original."
"Xbox World 360 Magazine UK","93","A sandbox with unparalleled scale, this comes close to even topping GTA IV. [Jan 2010, p.80]"
"AceGamez","93","Needless to say, Assassin’s Creed II is a game full of intrigue and mystery that will keep you engrossed from the awkward opening to the epic finale."
"MondoXbox","92","Assassin's Creed II is all the first game should have been if the authors developed more  deeply plot, characters and gameplay: being able to rely on a well proven engine, they focused this time on a making the game more interactive and varied, even if it’s missing some of the wow factor the first game had two years ago. A fascinating action-adventure, full of things to do and moved buy an intriguing story: a must buy."
"IGN","92","The experience is layered, unique, and shows an incredible attention to detail. This is one case where the sequel has triumphed over the original by catching the gameplay up to the already excellent visuals. No matter what your preconceptions are about Assassin's Creed II, the game is well worth your time and money."
"GameTrailers","92","Assassin’s Creed II has plenty of fixes and additions, but the story can drag, and the sense of awe that the parkour provided two years ago is muted. Yet new mission types, freedom from a linear quest, added depth, and a stronger historical bent fortify the overall experience. There’s still no other game quite like it, and whether you dismissed the first game or absolutely loved it, this is one creed worth taking."
"Cheat Code Central","92","Assassin's Creed II is greatly improved over its predecessor. At the same time, it doesn't mess with what made the game so attractive to fans in the first place. The varied and refined gameplay along with the engaging story makes this title a must-buy for any serious gamer."
"Gamers.at","92","Ezio has no problem beating Altair's efforts. On the technical side there might be some problems, but Assassin's Creed II is one of the best open world games out there."
"XboxAddict","92","Simply put, Assassin’s Creed 2 is a much more enjoyable experience front to back and much better put together."
"GamingTrend","92","While I was cautiously optimistic in starting up Assassin's Creed 2, within the first three hours it had it's hooks in me."
"HellBored","92","By being better in almost every department than its predecessor, Assassin’s Creed 2 does exactly what a sequel should."
"Pelit (Finland)","92","Manages to fix almost everything that felt lacking in the first installment. With it's stunning visuals, engaging storyline and fun gameplay Assassin's Creed II is easily one of the best games of 2009. [Dec 2009]"
"SpazioGames","91","Assassin's Creed II delivers a great story driven experience. Solving most of the problems of its predecessor, this accomplished sequel offers compelling action, beautiful environments and a great plethora of well written characters. A must have for every action-adventure fan with a taste for history, and one of the best games of this fall."
"1UP","91","AC2 is everything a sequel ought to be: An improvement on the original in nearly every way. Perhaps more impressively, it actually has me interested to see where the series goes from here -- something I wouldn't have expected after I slogged my way through the original. Anyone who enjoyed the first game will definitely like AC2, but the real accomplishment is that people who didn't enjoy it will likely have a good time, too."
"ActionTrip","91","The ending is, of course, something I do not wish to spoil for you guys, but it needs to be said that Assassin's Creed 2 comes to a decent conclusion. So much so that I cannot wait to find out what the folks at Ubisoft Montreal have prepared for the franchise's next outing."
"Game Revolution","91","Assassin's Creed was easily one of my favorite games of the last decade, and I love the sequel even more. It has managed to improve on almost every aspect of the game, despite missing a couple of obvious and unfortunate mistakes. This side trip to Italy is a truly fantastic vacation and worth every dollar, euro, or gold Florin."
"Official Xbox Magazine UK","90","The first Assassin's Creed's charm was in the sumptuous graphics and straightforward action - that incredible climbing and free-running, and the visceral thrill of stapling evil people to the dirt with a wristblade. With AC2 the rest of the game has caught up with the brilliance of those central ideas to create a complete and coherent experience. We can think of plenty of words that could describe Assassin's Creed 2 - involving, exciting, cinematic - but there's only one word that sums it up beautifully. Killer. [Dec 2009, p.74]"
"GameSpot","90","Assassin's Creed II is what you'd want an action sequel to be: bigger, better, and more beautiful."
"Eurogamer Italy","90","Assassin's Creed 2 has more variety than its prequel, and it's a great gaming experience. Despite a graphics engine which is good but that no longer represents the cutting edge, the real difference is now the storyline and the gameplay. Ubisoft has listened to what people were asking for, and we are now in front of what Assassin's Creed was supposed to be."
"VideoGamer","90","The storyline is intricate, there's depth beyond the main quest, the presentation is wonderful, and the action is incredible at times. We've had some stunning single-player experiences this year, and Ubisoft has given us another gem to add to the list."
"Total Video Games","90","Perhaps the ultimate testimony is the fact that it left us longing for another sequel, something the original certainly never achieved."
"XGN","90","Ezio is the evolution of Altaïr. The game shows improvement and keeps you fascinated because it offers enough variation. The graphical performance is high and the sound is just fine. This game just simply can't be missing from your collection!"
"IGN AU","90","It is not, however, a flawless experience by any means – and we think the series' finest hour is still coming – but for fans of the original, it's the step forward we were rooting for and just tempting enough for new players to savour."
"9Lives","90","Assassin's Creed 2 manages to wipe away most of the criticisms towards the previous game and delivers a gameplay experience you shouldn't miss. It's varied and addictive; character animations are realistic and fluent; the story is excellent and audio-visually it is good looking. It deserves a place in your game collection."
"Gameplanet","90","One of the most immersive games of 2009. An epic storyline and excellent gameplay leave us almost entirely satisfied."
"MS Xbox World","90","This is one sequel certainly worthy of a purchase, and no doubt a contender even for game of the year."
"NZGamer","90","The sequel possesses hours of extra activities, a more complicated plot and still manages to maintain a great gameplay engine while adding some much appreciated tweaks to expand the controls slightly."
"PALGN","90","A vast improvement over the original, Assassin's Creed II is among the most compelling action sandbox titles available."
"games(TM)","90","The sequel to one of this generation's biggest disappointments has emerged as a strong contender for game of the year, and if you didn't see that coming, don't worry - neither did we. [Christmas 2009, p.122]"
"X-ONE Magazine UK","90","An ambitious, immersive experience that somehow manages to revolutionise every key flaw in its predecessor. [Issue#53, p.78]"
"Thunderbolt","90","Minor annoyances aside though, Assassin’s Creed II is a superb game. Ubisoft have clearly listened to the reaction to the first game and have gone out of their way to remedy its problems."
"Gaming Target","90","It's been a busy holiday season, but don't let that distract you from checking out this game – you'll be surprised at how different – and better – the game is compared to its predecessor."
"Console Monster","90","You can easily put over 20 hours into Assassin’s Creed 2, the story is intriguing and starting to evolve and gameplay feels solid."
"Play Magazine","90","High praise for taking what felt like an idea in Assassin’s Creed and turned it into one of the year’s most ambitious and enjoyable games."
"Xbox World Australia","90","Playing Assassin's Creed II, one can't help but think Ubisoft really did listen to the criticism of the last game. Everything has been expanded upon and improved."
"NTSC-uk","90","The game is truly epic and makes the first game feel like a prototype for the sequel. It is a deep and wonderfully involving game that is often breathtaking and constantly rewarding."
"IGN UK","88","AC2 is a dramatically better game than its parent. It takes itself far less seriously, it's identified what was fun and thrown out what wasn't, and it's built upon a core free-running structure that's forever spectacular and thrilling. A little sadly, its fundamental concept and structure has been seriously overshadowed by the slicker likes of Mirror's Edge (in some ways) and Arkham Asylum (in a whole lot of ways)."
"Absolute Games","86","Ubisoft has finally realized its darling dream by creating a world where substance and style go together. Virtual tours of Florence, Venice and Tuscany are as captivating as the main story. For once in a way, “open-ended” doesn’t translate to “boring”, “lifeless” or “empty”. The height takes your breath away every time Ezio scales a tall building; the excellent animation makes up for annoying bugs and quirky gameplay conventions. Yes, the final boss fight is borderline silly, but it’s just a smudged line on a last page of a thrilling novel."
"Hardcore Gamer","85","In short, Assassin’s Creed 2 is the game that the original should have been"
"GameShark","83","Assassin’s Creed 2 isn’t perfect – the controls continue to requite a bit more fine tuning but it’s also impossible to deny that the sequel improves upon the original in almost every conceivable way."
"Giant Bomb","80","But this isn't a reinvention, it's a refinement. Assassin's Creed II offers, fundamentally, the same kinds of thrills as its predecessor--leaping from rooftop to rooftop with surefooted ease, appearing out of nowhere to kill your target with a quick blade, then vanishing effortlessly into a crowd. It's just been expanded, streamlined, and overhauled in ways that bring it closer to grace and make it a much easier game to recommend."
"Meristation","80","Two years later, Assassin's Creed tries again to make real those promises from Ubisoft, and prove itself as a better game than it was. The truth is that, despite the Renaissance setting, the vivid locations and the historical landmarks, the new features added don't really improve the sequel: the same repetitive mechanics remain, as the flawed enemy AI, a rough combat system and moments of frustration coming from issues with the camera and the control response in the platform sections. Assassin's Creed II it's still a good game but far from the masterpiece Ubisoft has been promising."
"BigPond GameArena","80","I've got to recommend it as a purchase - if only because the fantastic free-running, beautiful Italian vistas and engrossing Animus world far outweigh any ludicrous ending or shaky start. If you didn't finish the first Assassin's Creed however, you would do well to find some background information on the story using the magic of the internet - something you really shouldn't have to do."
"Metro GameCentral","80","A vast improvement on the flawed original, with much more variety and a much greater sense of fun."
"Worth Playing","80","Fans of the original Assassin's Creed will find a lot to love here, but anyone who left the first game feeling unsatisfied will want to rent before they buy."
"Gamer.nl","80","Assassin's Creed 2 is an excellent game. It's impressive to climb a massive cathedral from which you can overlook the entire city. The game surpasses the original game in almost every aspect, but the flawed AI and weak ending hold it back from becoming what we hoped for. It's still a beautiful adventure from the very beginning until the end."
"Telegraph","80","Assassin’s Creed II rarely gets the blood-pumping as much as some of the more visceral games of this year manage, instead opting for an air of odd serenity. Rather than bludgeoning you with a frontal assault on the senses, the beauty and elegance of the setting and gameplay washes over you, holding your attention completely."
"Armchair Empire","80","Assassin's Creed II is a fun game and I recommend it."
"DarkZero","60","To say the least, Assassin’s Creed II is a disappointment – not because it’s bad, but because we were promised so much more. Everything Ubisoft claimed they were changing has stayed the same, and what little new touches they’ve included fail to impact in the long run."
"GameCritics","55","Although it's possible to rattle off a list of bullet-point features that imply Assassin's Creed II is head and shoulders above the first game—more missions, more story, more collectibles and extras—I simply didn't find them to amount to much."
"Destructoid","45","The game's variety and length come across as nothing more than smoke and mirrors, the endless, grinding busywork that contributes nothing to the overall gameplay is inexcusably plentiful and mind-numbingly repetitive, and to top it all off, the game can't even compete in the visuals department and somehow looks worse than the original."
