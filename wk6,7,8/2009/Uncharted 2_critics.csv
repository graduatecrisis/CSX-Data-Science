"ZTGD","100","Spread across twenty-six chapters is a story as playful and worthwhile as the gameplay."
"Game Revolution","100","Among Thieves is all about constant movement. And even movement on top of movement. It grabbed me from the beginning and didn't let go for twelve hours. Once I finished, all I could think about was playing it again. More than a defining game for the PS3, Uncharted 2 is a defining game of this console generation."
"RealGamer","100","Its high production values shine out in its excellent visuals, brilliant sound design and intense and immersive gameplay."
"Gamer Limit","100","Naughty Dog has created one of the true masterpieces of our time by combining engaging gameplay, an adrenaline pumping character driven story, and a solid addictive mutliplayer mode, which holds hundreds of hours of potential."
"D+PAD Magazine","100","Left me wishing I had enough time and luxury to jump straight back in and take the entire journey again. It's destined to enter the annals of gaming's classics in years to come."
"Playstation Universe","100","With Among Thieves, Naughty Dog has shattered the proverbial bar it created with the 2007 original. This is quite possibly the best game to have graced the PS3, and without a doubt one of the greatest titles ever conceived."
"Gamer's Hell","100","Among Thieves is not only one of the best games of the year, it's also the benchmark for action games to come."
"GameShark","100","Uncharted 2 is easily one of the best games released on the PlayStation 3, but also finds itself as one of the best releases across any platform in recent memory."
"AceGamez","100","Uncharted 2 is an exemplary title and one that smacks of a developer at the peak of its game. From every piece of cover and set-piece thrown in fiendishly to catch you unaware, to the expertly crafted multiplayer maps and top quality cut scenes, it is clear that a innumerable amount of dedication and painstaking precision has been squeezed out of the team to help make this the PS3's crowning moment."
"Gaming Nexus","100","The level of polish is near perfect."
"Kikizo","100","Lacklustre finale aside, this is everything you could ask of a headline third-person shooter and more."
"Armchair Empire","100","This isn't just the best game released this year, or even the best Playstation 3 game yet, it's one of the best games released during this generation of consoles."
"DarkStation","100","If there is one game for the Playstation 3 this year that I would say is a ""must buy"" Uncharted 2 is that game, it truly is one of the best games in years and could very well be the best Playstation 3 game of 2009."
"Gamestyle","100","It's truly an adventure from start to finish, and something that every gamer should experience."
"Playstation: The Official Magazine (US)","100","A veritable master class of all-round game development. From a sensational single-player experience that never takes any short-cuts and maintains its story's mythological credibility right to the end to the co-operative online play to the robust, balanced, and just plain fun multiplayer modes, this is a package of content that more than earns its $60 price tag... [It's] this season's biggest PS3 victory. [Nov 2009, p.42]"
"GamesRadar+","100","Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant. It looks amazing, plays like a dream and the voice-acting/story-telling will hook you in right from the off. PS3 officially has it's a killer-app and a million tears are shed by 360 fanboys."
"Playstation Official Magazine UK","100","Unless you're born without thumbs, eyes or a sense of humour, it's obvious that Uncharted 2 is a 10/10 game after two minutes of the first level...It's the most complete, polished and fun adventure game - and maybe just game - on PS3, and it's absolutely essential. [Nov 2009, p.101]"
"Eurogamer Portugal","100","Could use many words to describe Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, but I will just use one. Too beautiful."
"Eurogamer","100","Whether or not the multiplayer sticks, however, is arguably a footnote, because at the core of Uncharted 2 is an action-adventure masterpiece whose minor flaws are washed away on a tide of rhythm and spectacle - one that would still be an essential experience even without the option to pull your friends off cliffs and play capture-the-heirloom."
"Computer and Video Games","100","It takes elements from a lot of games - the exploration of Tomb Raider, climbing of Prince of Persia/Assassin's Creed, combat from Gears of War and stealth from Splinter Cell, yet it amalgamates all of these elements perfectly into one package. You can't compare it to any other game."
"Eurogamer Spain","100","Uncharted 2 does not reinvent the gaming language, but pushes this genre to new limits. If you don't have a PS3, buy one to play this game."
"PS3bloggen.se","100","Naughty Dog have created an amazing movie adventure on the PS3 with unparalleled graphics, fantastic dialogue and amazing platforming elements. There is no need to wait for the film version of this game, as it's already arrived in everyone's living room. Unmissable."
"GamePro","100","The A.I. is a little suspect, the camera can be stubborn, and you will die your fair share of cheap deaths. But it's still a fantastic effort and Naughty Dog deserves full credit for building upon the momentum of the first installment. PS3 owners should definitely experience it, especially if they liked the original."
"1UP","100","Uncharted 2 is simply a vast improvement over its predecessor, and it's a damn great PS3 game. Let's leave the ""are games art?"" question for another time; what Uncharted 2 proves is that games are, at the very least, craft. Just as Raiders is Spielberg at the top of his game, Uncharted 2 is Naughty Dog at the top of theirs, and further proof that they are masters of their craft. [Grade = A+]"
"Playstation Official Magazine Australia","100","The spectacular combination of generation-defining visuals, high adventure and cinematic intensity makes Uncharted 2 absolutely essential. There aren't any reasons not to own this game. [Nov 2009, p.64]"
"Level7.nu","100","The sequel to the masterfully crafted Uncharted: Drake's Fortune manages to up the notch to a whole new level, the result being the best adventure we've seen on this generation of console hardware. Praise be infinite when looking at the different aspects of the Uncharted 2 experience: fantastic graphics, great cast of characters, superb level design, masterfully directed movie sequences, fun combat and a well told story all make up what is undoubtedly a landmark of game design. Add to this a great online co-op mode as well as fun multiplayer modes and you get a game that by itself is a reason to buy a PS3."
"Cynamite","100","Uncharted 2 is one of the most memorable video games ever created. Not because it is particularly innovative, but because the mixture of shooting, climbing, creeping, thinking, laughing and simple astonishment works perfectly."
"Total Video Games","100","Uncharted 2 is a magnificent example of how this generation can infuse movie production quality with enjoyable gameplay and maintain a sense of fluidity throughout the feature presentation. The sheer craft on display throughout every single moment deserves every accolade it receives; truly Naughty Dog has delivered a generation-defining experience that is worthy of buying/borrowing/stealing a PS3."
"Gamer.nl","100","No game is perfect. But Among Thieves does so many things incredibly well, that any miniscule faults that may have crept in the final game don't matter at all. Gamers that buy Uncharted 2 will be breathless after playing through one of the most incredible and intense adventures ever. The dialogue and the humour are the icing on the cake."
"Eurogamer Italy","100","Uncharted 2 is not innovative. But everything in it is better than in the first chapter. And everything seems nearly perfect. It is simply the new standard for the action adventure genre. A perfect mix between single player and multiplayer and something that will pave a new way for videogames. Any other production in the future will have to look at it. As we said at the beginning: the perfect game doesn't exist...but Naughty Dog seems really interested in finding a way to bring it to us."
"Telegraph","100","Among Thieves is not a reinvention of the genre, more a definition. A sumptuous adventure that enthrals from start to finish, a cast that you'll fall in love with and a tale that's better scripted, directed and paced than most Hollywood blockbusters. It is a testament to the extraordinary talent at Naughty Dog and a glorious celebration of what video games can be when they play to their enviable strengths."
"The A.V. Club","100","But the character interaction and the superb story will stay with players long after they've escaped its final trap."
"Game Informer","100","Uncharted 2 is a ringing testament to the power of both games and storytelling. It pulls you in, keeps you engaged, and concludes with a thunderous bang."
"Gamervision","100","The words “cinematic experience” have been used to describe the game so often that they are probably cliché by now, but it’s something that simply must be said. I found myself saying “just one more chapter” for hours; I never wanted to stop playing, and I never wanted the game to end."
"Gaming Age","100","Uncharted 2: Among Thieves is everything you could ask for in a videogame: immensely satisfying and challenging gameplay, a great story with likable characters, a stunning audio-visual experience, plenty of replayability, and by the time the game ends, the feeling that every dollar spent on buying the game was well worth it. [Grade = A+]"
"Giant Bomb","100","Naughty Dog set out with a very specific goal in mind, and in focusing intently on that goal, they blew right past it. Uncharted 2 is a sublime example of how to make a great action game, the result of fantastic execution on every aspect of the game's design and development. It's the best, most memorable game I've played in a long, long time."
"Kombo","100","Uncharted 2 can't come with enough rave recommendations. This game has something for everybody, no questions asked."
"DarkZero","100","It's the amalgamation of years of action games, adventure stories and box office smashes rolled into one ten hour action sequence. It's Indiana Jones meets Broken Arrow, meets Cliff Hanger, meets Bad Boys – and then some. The production values are through the roof and the level of polish that's gone into this game are something else."
"Da Gameboyz","100","Every element has been finely crafted, from sound to graphics to cut-scenes to gameplay. All of this thrusts the player in to a tumultuous thrill ride that has no bounds. And as for the multiplayer, it is a well implemented feature too."
"GameFocus","99","While it may not re-invent anything, Naughty Dog makes it feel like something new thanks to their care for detail and wish to deliver a one-of-a-kind experience. If past PS3 exclusives such as Metal Gear Solid 4 and Killzone 2 set a foothold in the Playstation landscape, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves tops everything we've seen so far, whether it's a first or third-party title. I will not go as far to name it ""Game of the Century"" because it's a bold statement. However, it does take a spot on the short list of outstanding games that will be often copied but never reproduced."
"GamingExcellence","98","It has not only a fun and engaging single player mode but also a robust multiplayer mode that can keep you busy long after you've played the game."
"NZGamer","98","Graphically Uncharted is almost entirely phenomenal. Not just good, great or awesome but truly and utterly incredible. The metallic surfaces and the jungle stand out as being more amazing looking that actual, real things."
"MEGamers","98","Every PS3 owner should get this game. It is one of the best experiences you will ever have."
"PSX Extreme","98","Uncharted 2 represents everything I've always wanted to see out of an action-adventure game such as this. It defines what videogames mean to me. It's designed in such a way that is completely the opposite of what most games in the genre have been doing, and yet, by taking a step back to a more traditional setup, it is without question the best game the genre has seen in a very long time. It is also without question the best looking console game I've ever seen, easily the best of the generation."
"Cheat Code Central","98","It does everything well, and some things it does without equal. It is so finely developed and produced that it will likely be looked at in the future as a seminal entry in video gaming. Uncharted 2: Among Thieves is a game that transcends the conventions of the medium, lending even more clout to an already robust industry, closely nipping at the heels of filmmaking, ushering in the era of interactive cinema."
"Extreme Gamer","98","Uncharted 2: Among Thieves is more than a step up from its original adventure, it's a complete package filled with memorable moments, death defying gameplay and online multiplayer modes."
"WonderwallWeb","98","Uncharted 2 is a stunning, epic game. This is an experience that Playstation 3 owners will not want to miss."
"Impulsegamer","98","Rather than reinvent the wheel, it gives the gamer a classical gaming experience with a 21st century feel and play. Sure there are a few frustrating moments in the game but in what game isn't?"
"Digital Chumps","98","It's a fantastic game, just as everyone hoped for and expected. Must buy."
"PSFocus","97","The graphics are stunning, the audio is brilliant, the gameplay is fabulous. The whole game is outstanding, maybe the best game of 2009!"
"3DJuegos","97","Uncharted 2: Among Thieves is among the best games of the Next-Gen, and is also a brilliant ambassador of the sadly forgotten genre of the action adventures."
"AtomicGamer","97","Regardless, Uncharted 2, despite a few nitpicks, is the best reason to own a PS3. Chasing fortune and glory has never been so much fun."
"Game Over Online","96","The single player story is one of the most memorable I've experienced in a long time, and the new multiplayer component is far from a tack on. It's a significant addition that presents tremendous replay value. Simply put, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves is the complete package."
"Gaming Target","96","Uncharted 2: Among Thieves is the kind of game you have to experience for yourself to understand just how great it really is."
"My Gamer","96","Uncharted 2: Among Thieves is, without a doubt, the kind of game you can buy a Playstation 3 for."
"XGN","96","Uncharted 2: Among Thieves is actually an overwhelmingly good title that every PS3-owner should purchase. And those who don't have a PS3, now have a really good reason to buy one."
"Vandal","96","It doesn't just meet expectations, it rolls over them. One of the best games of the year."
"Play UK","96","Nathan Drake is a likeable hero, his story is funny, interesting and exciting and the game itself is a masterpiece. Uncharted 2 is absolutely, positively, genuinely fantastic and a reason to own a PS3, of that there is no doubt."
"Play.tm","96","A game that manages to feel like a genuinely significant step forward while retaining everything that was so great about the original. The addition of a stunning multiplayer component and the creative freedom of the Cinema mode are like the enjoyably overindulgent pudding after a wonderfully satisfying main meal that make you thankful for elastic waistbands."
"Gamer 2.0","96","When all is said and done, Naughty Dog has done an amazing job of fixing any issues that the original game had for Uncharted 2: Among Thieves while adding more to make this a package that anybody with an ounce of interest should not miss."
"Multiplayer.it","96","Uncharted 2: Among Thieves takes all the best from the first chapter and improve it even further. Technically speaking the game is amazing from every point of view, the gameplay mechanic is varied, involving and spectacular. The multiplayer is surprisengly solid and funny, and push the longevity far beyond Drake's Fortune. A must buy, not only for PS3 owner."
"PSM3 Magazine UK","95","Gorgeous, funny, and epic. A landmark achievement for your PS3. [Dec 2009, p.72]"
"Console Monster","95","Older fans will enjoy Drake's new adventure whilst newcomers will not need to know much, if any, of the story from the first title to enjoy it as equally."
"TotalPlayStation","95","Uncharted 2: Among Thieves defines must-own."
"IGN","95","It's very, very good. It's easily one of the best games on the system, blending fantastic presentation and visuals with gameplay that is practically second to none. And then there's the stellar multiplayer which you'll probably be playing until Uncharted 3 ships. No, Uncharted 2 is not perfect, but it's closer than pretty much any other game out there these days."
"Meristation","95","Uncharted 2 has no rival on the PS3. There's no other game, despite Killzone 2 on the visuals, with the same level of quality as Naughty Dog's newest game. The rhythm of the game is fast-paced and action-packed, and includes some fun, well-thought-out dialogue. The game is almost perfect in every stage, and it has online coop and deathmatch; there's no doubt that it's one of the top three games for the PS3, and one of the five best games of this year."
"BigPond GameArena","95","The streamlined nature of the story also helps keep the pace of the game up - and the game rarely takes a breather. When Nathan isn't blasting dozens of enemies he's showing off remarkable athleticism as he leaps across buildings and dives around corners. Naturally all of his companions are just as athletic - the amount of climbing and swinging they do leaves me out of breath just watching."
"GameSpot","95","With an exhilarating campaign, intense cooperative mode, and addictive multiplayer competition, Uncharted 2 is a complete game that is completely awesome."
"Everyeye.it","95","A thrilling adventure, with a perfect plot and a fascinating setting. Multiplayer mode is various and entertaining."
"IGN AU","95","It's a staggeringly impressive achievement; a rollercoaster ride of shoot-outs, action set pieces, compelling traversal sequences and light puzzle solving. It ups the ante in every respect from the original, and while it may be all about the action and the stunning vistas on the surface, the reality is that it's the game's personality, and the game's heart, that is its driving force."
"Hardcore Gamer","95","Uncharted 2: Among Thieves is one of the most polished, most intense and most entertaining pieces of software out on the market."
"GameWatcher","95","Gameplay mechanics have been smoothed out greatly, and Uncharted 2 is one of the few PS3 games that both requires no installation and loads quickly. Maps are very large, and several levels have high-speed chases, helicopter attacks, and has players jumping from rooftops."
"Destructoid","95","There's no other game in its genre that even comes close to it on any other platform. Whether or not that makes Among Thieves the system seller Sony's been looking for remains to be seen, but it's without a doubt among the best exclusive games found on any console this generation."
"Gameplanet","95","Uncharted 2 improves on the original in almost every way. A solid gaming experience, and one that will rate among the very best PS3 games ever made."
"Play Magazine","95","An extraordinary video-game. It’s polished, entertaining, and unrelenting. The animation, the dialogue, and every environment is stunning. Video-games, as they are now, don’t get any better than this."
"Worth Playing","95","Uncharted 2: Among Thieves is one of the best games this year on the PlayStation 3."
"InsideGamer.nl","95","Uncharted 2: Among Thieves delivers! The singleplayer experience is superb and it looks absolutely fabulous. The characters are very realistic, thanks to the amazing voice acting. And besides that, there are a lot of cool scenes and it has a very fun multiplayer mode. Must have!"
"PALGN","95","Uncharted 2 is a masterfully crafted game that not only blurs the lines between game and film, but sets a really, really high benchmark for action games to come."
"GamerNode","95","One of the best games to come out this year. An extremely immersive story, solid gameplay, great sound, addictive multiplayer, and one of the best-looking games of all time."
"GamingTrend","94","There isn't another game out there that can come close to offering a more movie-like experience and at the same time not short-change the gameplay like in other cutscene-heavy titles."
"SpazioGames","94","Uncharted 2 is a great title, and one of the best of this entire generation. Its only flaw is a lack of real innovation for the videogame culture, although entirely made up for by an incredible merging between gameplay and cinematics. You'll literally fall in love with the characters, the story, and the beautiful settings. The multiplayer side is in our opinion not entirely necessary, although developed with care for details, and will provide even more fun on top of the 10+ hour single player experience."
"GamesNation","93","Graphically stunning, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves is, first of all, an interactive adventure, one that feels like a movie and even has a storyline of a movie. Most gameplay situations have been tailored in order to stun the player with originality and identification, and the end result is absolutely amazing."
"GameTrailers","93","Uncharted 2: Among Thieves is one of the most polished games we've ever played. At every corner there's something new to marvel at. Whether it's the sharp writing, twisting story, frenetic pacing, or tight (albeit derivative) gameplay, this is one of those games that a lot of people will play in one sitting."
"DailyGame","93","Uncharted 2: Among Thieves is a fantastic game, and every PS3 owner should experience it."
"Games Master UK","92","What it lacks in originality it makes up for with polished gameplay and engaging storytelling. [Dec 2009, p.60]"
"9Lives","92","Uncharted 2: Among Thieves is a rollercoaster ride from start to finish. The singleplayer is handled to perfection and the multiplayer – despite some minor irritations – will push its lifespan tremendously. If you want to claim that you’ve played all the best games of this generation, then Uncharted 2: Among Thieves has to be in your collection.  There’s only two questions remaining: Naughty Dog, where’s Uncharted 3? Gamers, why aren’t you in the store already to buy this gem?"
"Gamers.at","92","Some critics might say that Uncharted 2 doesn't do anything new. Still: There's nothing that can compare to this game which is a true next-gen game with all virtues. Go get this game!"
"GamingXP","91","The huge story full of emotional moments, profound characters, unexpected turnarounds in combination with the amazingly beautiful graphic will entertain you for hours and hours."
"HellBored","91","The PS3 equivalent of a summer blockbuster, scripted and directed by a silver screen Goliath, makes Naughty Dog's anticipated sequel a landmark in gaming."
"Thunderbolt","90","Among Thieves is unquestionably one of the most alluring and exciting titles to have ever graced a gaming platform."
"LEVEL (Czech Republic)","90","Uncharted 2 shows what an interactive movie should look like. Stunning visuals, breathtaking situations and nice story moments create an outstanding action game to remember.  [Nov 2009]"
"GameCritics","90","Among Thieves is far and away the best game that I have played this year, and one I will likely come back to time and again."
"games(TM)","90","It's tempting to brand this the watershed moment when we stop saddling narrative-driven games with blunt, inelegant descriptors like 'first-person shooter', 'platformer' or 'puzzler', and simply honour the mood. Uncharted 2: Among Thieves is an action comedy - nothing else fits nearly as well. [Dec 2009, p.94]"
"Boomtown","90","The game's story and dialogue, while full of plenty of macho nonsense, is humorous and never takes itself quite seriously - giving great credibility to the engaging characters."
"VideoGamer","90","Uncharted 2 does so many things right, that its problems (a less than perfect cover system, some frustrating combat and unfortunate glitches) are easy to overlook. The single-player adventure packs in so many incredible moments that you'll be talking about it with friends for months, the multiplayer functionality is superb and rammed with content, and the whole game looks beyond anything you'll have seen before."
"GameSpy","90","Minor complaints aside, Uncharted 2 is the single best PS3-exclusive title to date. I love the voice acting and characters, and I can honestly say that the multiplayer is something I see myself returning to again and again."
"Gameplayer Sweden","90","A rollicking adventure without a dull moment. The engaging cast of characters, rock-solid gameplay and stunning visuals make for a game that's pure joy from the beginning to the end."
"GameDaily","90","If any game in 2009 deserves a purchase, it is undoubtedly Uncharted 2. But taking a very close look, it isn't perfect."
"GameZone","90","The game has some repetition, but the look of the game is wonderful and the action flows well, drawing players through the game. This is an enjoyable game that keeps players on their toes, tantalizes with stunning vistas and some cool animations and keeps the story flowing well."
"IGN UK","90","It's unfortunate that the gameplay doesn't scale the heights of the production values, for while the gunplay is solid its relentlessness becomes weary towards the finale. But any misgivings aren't enough to derail the immensely enjoyable rollercoaster ride and Uncharted 2's wealth of character easily overcomes our gripes."
"Metro GameCentral","90","The best exclusive on the PS3 is also one of this gen's greatest (and most attractive) action adventures."
"Edge Magazine","90","Ultimately, no one will disagree that Uncharted 2 is one hell of a ride, and the best PS3 action game to date."
"TheSixthAxis","90","For anyone that enjoys third person adventures Uncharted 2 represents a thrilling experience with some breathtaking set pieces and enough challenge to retain your interest far longer than most console games this generation, and it's almost worth buying just for the graphics which I don't think will be bettered for a good couple of years."
"Absolute Games","89","Uncharted 2 is a blockbuster made with passion.  The best ten hours you'll spend sitting in front of the TV in 2009."
"NTSC-uk","80","The developers have played it safe to some degree and because of this Uncharted 2 doesn’t feel like it has an identity of its own."
