2016,Overwatch,This is an example of AAA graphics and sound coupled with bland gameplay. Combat is clunky and dissatisfying. Blizzard has not shown the capacity to address imbalances between characters. Power adjustments are more of marketing actions to address complaints in Blizzard's forums rather than rational decisions made by developers looking at aggregated data.

2016,Overwatch,"- Minimal content for the price tag - 12 maps, 21 characters (many with a lot of skill overlap), 2 game modes.- Low skill ceiling, boring after a couple dozen hours once you've learned all the characters' tricks.- Built in wallhacks and aimbots engineered as ""abilities"" and marketed as ""gameplay mechanics"".- Loot box lottery; gambling style mechanics designed to push sales of- Minimal content for the price tag - 12 maps, 21 characters (many with a lot of skill overlap), 2 game modes.- Low skill ceiling, boring after a couple dozen hours once you've learned all the characters' tricks.- Built in wallhacks and aimbots engineered as ""abilities"" and marketed as ""gameplay mechanics"".- Loot box lottery; gambling style mechanics designed to push sales of loot box microtransactions.- Terrible character balance leading to mandatory picks and/or mandatory stacking in games, especially in higher level play once people have learned how to avoid the lesser balanced characters.- Horrible map design which favors defending teams allowing them to hold choke points directly outside of their base easily while attacking teams have to run 10+ seconds back from a spawn point after waiting 6 seconds to respawn. Additionally, defending teams get a 60 second head start which allows them to easily camp the initial attacking team's base with impunity.- 20Hz tick rate and predictive ""favor the shooter"" netcode that leads to lots of cheap deaths and kills. Turn off your kill cam unless you like to rage.I scoff at the very notion that this will ever be a competitive shooter. We're already watching competitive outlets outright ban maps like 2 Control Point and community map voting rules have effectively banned King of the Hill maps. No custom servers, no server browser... this is a casual game through and through, designed solely for people to pick up and play a few matches then put down. If ever anyone needed proof of this, just look at how Blizzard was quick to address an animation cancel for Widowmaker that promoted skill. (Third post time is a charm, I guess.)\"
2016,Overwatch,"Most time you have casuals in your team everybody do what he want, real team play is very rar. and there is no long time Motivation....waste of money."

No, not at all.+20 tick servers are primitive.+Some heroes have such low skill ceilings.- This can be good for attracting a casual audience, but since this is supposed to be such a 'competitive game' - even having tournaments arranged before release it seems somewhat wrong.+ There is nothing more to the characters than is intended by Blizzard.- No forms of complex movement, something that really makes or breaks a game for me.+ Ultimate's require no skill to use.- How effective an ult is is based completely on timing and luck. There is no SKILL in lucky timing.+ Some classes have weapons which literally require you to aim within 75 degrees of an enemy to hit them. It's a little ridiculous for a ""Skilled"" FPS.\"

2016,Overwatch,"A serie with alot of hype, mainly because it is a Blizzard game with their ""Blizzard polish"". This game is fun, but won't have a long longevity for me after spending a decent amount of hours(around 100) playing this game. I will explain it as short as possible for the people who wants quick and short reviews to compare it with each other:EDIT: It isn't as short as I thought it wouldA serie with alot of hype, mainly because it is a Blizzard game with their ""Blizzard polish"". This game is fun, but won't have a long longevity for me after spending a decent amount of hours(around 100) playing this game. I will explain it as short as possible for the people who wants quick and short reviews to compare it with each other:EDIT: It isn't as short as I thought it would be, so my appologize.Positive:- It's a fun and solid teambased shooter when you're new to this game:It's a fun and fresh experience, when you're learning each maps and characters. Every character is unique, but also easy to learn/understand. The maps are also well designed enough for each character.This is subjective and a negative for some gamers: People who wants complex characters won't get what they want. So this could be a negative. For example, Mei is a hero with a tier 4 difficutly, yet she doesn't feel that different in difficulty compared to a tier 1 character like Bastion.- You can switch characters during game and also able to play as the same heroes as your teammates::So you and your team can accustom to how your opponents are playing incase you have chosen the wrong hero. Or you can experiment by changing your heroes till you find the synergy to win the game. Or go crazy and have fun with weird hero combinations(even though this may be disrespectfull for your opponent).- Teamplay is pretty important in the game:For example, your health won't regenerate, hence you need a healer. However, you don't need a healer if you don't want to play that way, since there are healing items lying around the map with a respawn/cooldown timer. This will slow down your teamplay if everyone is scattered around to find the healing items and heal themself. Each hero has their role(attackers, defenders, supporters and healers).- Game isn't technically impressive. However, we're gamers and the visual presentation and performance is nice and that's what matters:It looks like a Pixar movie(not hitting that lvl, but the style is similiar) and the gameplay is fluent. Especially on the console, since it's pretty hard for developers to hit the 60fps on consoles and Overwatch is one of those game hitting the 60fps with a dynamic resolution.Negatives:- Short longevity for some gamers:This doesn't apply to everyone ofcourse. But the amount of content is pretty small for a priced game. This game is only PvP and while the game is fun to play, it's all you will get(with the exception of future contents(but the question is, will that be enough)). All the heroes are unlocked and the maps. The only thing you will get are sprays, skins(some are interesting if I'm honest hehe), taunts, etc. As you may noticed, all the things I've mentioned doesn't add any value to the actual game, beside being aesthetic. All the character will play the same, meaning you won't be able to personalize your character like some other games do. Hence this longevity will be short after knowing how all your heroes plays and how to play in each maps. This is the main reason why I won't give this game a high score/perfect score like a 9 or 10.- The game isn't complete, since the competitive gamemode will come in the next update:Meaning, you're buying a game which isn't complete. Similiar towards SFV, but that one is far worse. This may be a trend in the future where publishers releases an incomplete game for the full price(sadly, I also bought this game, meaning I can't say much about this). Also another reason why I won't give this game an 8.Hence my final verdict being a 7. I hope you understand why I gave this a 7 and this is my personal opinion anyways for the people who disagrees :) 7 is a good game IMO, even though it isn't a 9 or a 10. Hope I helped some people with this review. And if you will buy this game or have bought this and still read this, because of curiosity:I hope you're enjoying your game and hope we will be teamed up and teamed against in Overwatch :PPS: Srry for my English.\"

2016,Overwatch,"There's a good game buried in Overwatch, but it is grossly overshadowed by one of the worst match making mechanics around. Enforcing a 50% win rate, you will have frustrating, boring match after frustrating, boring match. Even if, somehow, you get a decent one, a rarity, the lack of maps will quickly make this game a dull use of forty dollars."

Playing solo can be frustrating and difficult if you are matched with pre-made teams6. Doesn't innovate in any noticeable or noteworthy wayThankfully most of these problems can be fixed and improved through patches so I am cautiously optimistic for this game.\"

2016,Overwatch,"Note: I'm updating my review with the addition of competitive mode (updated part of review is in ""UPDATE"" section.It's a nice shooter from Blizzard, not to serious, not to cheesy.

For me, person who hates military shooters this title suits well. The game is very fast paced and there is always some action going on, which is great.Pros:- Pretty good and consistent artstyle- Cool heroes with distinct abilities- Fluid and polished combat- Simple to pick up, but has enough depth to not get bored quickly- Great performance even on older machines- Engaging gameplay centered on objectives.Pros:- Game suffers from not that good netcode with only ~20Hz tickrate- No ranked (competitive mode) on release (being reworked and patched in at a later date)- Hero stacking can be frustrating at timesOne more thing is that people complain about it's business model. Personally I like buy to play model, with some cosmetic micro-transaction. If this had pay-walls or grind-walls with f2p model, I would not even play it. I hate that in hearthstone and hate that in Heroes of the Storm. With Overwatch, you can take few months break and don't fall behind compared to other people - all heroes (including upcoming ones) are available right of the bat, same goes for maps and game modes and what not - basically all content, apart cosmetics (which is not any in-game advantage whatsoever).But this is fun game, especially to play with friends (but it's okay too when playing with random people). If you look for hardcore competitive game with advanced mechanics and lot of depth - this games is probably not for you, in other case - I can recommend it.UPDATE!!! (mostly about competitive mode)I initially gave it weak 8/10. But since Blizzard patched in competitive mode (aka ranked system) I've decided to update my review.Basically competitive mode is in broken state. There are serious bugs (or maybe design choice) related to how your rank progression is calculated. As notable example, if you win the competitive game, and there is a leaver (person who abandoned game), regardless if you are on affected team or not, in any winner gets barely no rank progress (in comparison on average it's more than 50% of rank progress, with a leaver it's less than 10%), but you always lose full amount of progress regardless if some leaver screws your game. 1week in, still no response on this issue. Additionally, people with 60% or greater winrate can fall in ranks just like that.Matchmaking is terrible, especially for solo people and small party groups. Most games are either you stomp the enemy or you are being stomped. Close games are scarce.The competitive mode is plagued with leavers (which can basically can leave as they please, because you have to abuse it to get even slightest penalty), griefers (who basically play the game their own way ignoring team's interest), trolls and all kind of people that will ruin you the fun of competing with other players.On top of that if game ends in draw, you basically play a coin flip, because draw is played on asymmetric map, where one side gets attack and other defense (that is not 50/50 chance to win).It's not a super competitive game when you go heavy try-hard mode, but competitive mode is competitive, even with casual aspects, but in current iteration it's absolutely broken and it will cause you only frustration due to multiple bugs and/or design flaws. Because the only long-term value is competitive mode (which should give you progression system and goals to achieve) and it's broken I'm changing my verdict from 8 to 5/10. Even if you look at this game more casually and intend to play just like 1-2 weeks per season, still some things can't be ignored and I eventually would not recommend it at this point.\"
2016,Overwatch,"Overall disappointed in Blizzard. I really really wanted to give this game a chance.

I really really wanted to give this game a chance.   I have been a Blizzard fan since Warcraft 1 on PC...owning and playing every game they have released religiously.Overwatch has good character design, smooth game play, decent graphics on PC/PS4 but no innovative features or game modes that will pull me away from any of my top FPS/TPS games (old and new).   Overwatch is a simplified FPS compared to others and it's not necessarily a bad thing.  The maps are well designed for close quarter battles and the game doesn't drag long.I think the simplicity of it will draw new players to the genre so they can pick it up easily.   To me,  it seems like they made this game for beginners to the FPS genre.  Sure vets can still play it and have fun with the characters abilities but if you look at it overall it's not as FUN as it can and should be.It reminds me of the same thing they tried to do when they entered the MOBA genre with Heroes of the Storm.  They simplified it compared to other MOBA games but I got bored of it quickly.  Maybe I'm an old hardcore gamer and I want to get my money's worth.  But $60 is alot of money for a multiplayer only FPS game with only 2 modes  There's not even a campaign with all the story behind the characters.Star Wars Battlefront basically multiplayer only but Battlefront is a much better FPS.  Like AMAZING compared to boring Overwatch!  Plus, the 2 game modes of hold the area and move the convoy aren't really exciting at all to play.  Couldn't they think of something more creative?   Heck! The game modes in Unreal Tournament especially 2004 still blow the Overwatch away.  Unreal 2004 (and on) still has the most enjoyable and creative progression objectives like Assault, Onslaught, etc.    Instead of a boring hold this spot then protect this new spot or convey.  It would've helped Overwatch tremendously if they learned from the game modes of Call of Duty, Castle Wolfenstein, Unreal Tournament and not just copying mainly Team Fortress.   I would've gladly pay $60 for this multiplayer-exclusive FPS game if it had better modes and features.  For example, maybe with some maps or modes they could have a train fight scenario to find the bomb, destroy big turret by progressively completing objectives.   So Overwatch is just a plain shooter.  Nothing special at all.  You could play any sci-fi shooter of the past and still get the same experience but just without the awesome character design.Overwatch took some good ideas from some FPS but not enough to make it great.It's just a ""clone"" FPS with a gorgeous reskin of characters with special moves.I'm a big fan of Blizzard and have played all their games religiously and even own collector's edition of all the PC games (from Warcraft, Diablo, Starcraft and I even bought the Overwatch one).  But I'm sorry I have to give this one a bad rating.  Not sure who took over creative directing at Blizzard but this one is a fail to me.  It might do well for teeny-boppers and millenials that jump on the hype.  And most likely Blizzard will front a bunch of $million dollar tournaments because they can.  But that still doesn't help make this a great FPS.  It's below average to me.  Even Team Fortress and Counterstrike are more fun than this.   They may only have a few maps or modes but they were the originators and still the BEST.  Blizzard tried to copy them and some other FPS but ended up being flat in the end.\"

There is essentially 1 game mode and that's it, and within that game mode there are only 2 gametypes. The maps all feel pretty much the same as well. They're all pretty linear making the map a more or less negligible element of the match. There is no reward system that seems to drive you to play or achieve something.For me, the game feel unfinished. Like it's a late stage beta or something. There just isn't enough content to keep players hooked for a considerable period of time. Most players will burn out after a month or two. The game is solid, well made, and works like it's supposed to. Basically this game doesn't have any errors per se, but it doesn't have any shining accolades either.\"

2016,Overwatch,"Take TF2, shine it up, take the game mechanic du jour (MOBA style abilities and ""ultimates"") and then mash it all together in a game that costs more than TF2 ever did. Whut?Yeah, this game has potential, it has promise, but it also has a lot of problems too.

Whut?Yeah, this game has potential, it has promise, but it also has a lot of problems too. Character balance is awful, fans of the game will tell you that it's an amazing game where being able to change your character means it's a constant game of rock paper scissors. That is until you realise that half a dozen characters in the game are both rock and paper, or scissors and rock, or even all three, when played by someone with a modicum of experience.Half objective based team shooter, half team deathmatch, the game shines when it is played like the former and results in pure frustration and anger because 2 or 3 people playing it like the latter can ruin any real sense of strategy or territorial control.But then the game clearly isn't set up to be a game of tactical nuance. Spawn times are almost non-existent meaning defenders are constantly able to defend, and maps are so poorly designed that they're either too open or too narrow.But ultimately (no pun intended?) what kills it for me are the one-two combos that many characters have that are nigh on impossible to counter without one of those rock and paper characters I previously mentioned. Roadhog's Chain and point blank shotgun blast will kill almost anyone in one shot after dragging them (with no counter and a stun) to right infront of him. McCree can stun you in place with a flashbang, unload his 6 shooter, roll for instant reload and shoot you for 6 against straight away. Mei only has to start hitting you with her stream of ice and, unless you have some kind of ""escape"" ability, you're going to be toast as she freezes you in place and then lines up a headshot while you can do nothing and kills you.This game is touted as supposedly being about being a ""Postive"" FPS, where people aren't downvoted or reported, where people are encouraged to commend people for achievements, where everyone gets ""elimination"" stats for having taken part in a kill. But at it's core it's a devious deathmatch game which rewards trolling behaviour by one player against another.But fans will tell you that there is depth and skill to this game, which may be true for Blizzard fans that have come from outside an FPS environment. For those of us that have been playing the genre for 20 years aren't seeing anything fundamentally new here, and what is new (the MOBA ability elements) are hamfistedly introduced without care for what makes MOBA games work... that good positioning and ancillary item use can counter and lessen the effects of people's abilities and ultimates, something entirely not present in this game.Over-hyped, this game could be mindless fun, but it's not even that right now.\"

Ever since Wrath of the Lich King, Blizzard has released increasingly low quality titles that somehow manage to get good reviews and make a lot of money. Overwatch is another Blizzard title that is more like a mobile app than an actual multi platform game.Pros and cons:+ Not many bugs or stability issues, runs really well+ All characters are unlocked from the go so you can easily try your favorite hero+ Lots of different characters with different play styles+ Graphics are typical for Blizzard, game looks pretty nice and doesn't require you to have a beefy PC- Netcode is quite simply horrible- Servers seemingly don't boot players with extreme pings- Game is designed around countering heroes/teams rather than improving your skills- Many auto win mechanics that will net you easy cheap kills with a press of a button- Matchmaking right now is quite bad, most rounds are insanely unfair and end pretty fast with one team just steamrolling the other. I've only had a handful of rounds that felt balanced and played well.- Punishing for solo players- Only a few maps and game modes, game is very repetitive. After playing for about 10-15 hours you've already seen and experienced the entire game and it doesn't really offer variety since the maps always play exactly the same.- For 40‚, you get a polished game worth about 10 hours of play time, most f2p titles can offer twice that, easily.- The game is constantly trying to guess where you're character is going to move because the tickrate is so low, so you will notice (at least I do, playing with 144hz @ 144+ fps) a lot of stuttering when moving as a fast character. To me this is really really annoying and I can't understand why this would be a thing in 2016.Conclusion:This is one of those games that feels like the designers were focusing on perfecting one aspect of the game and completely forgot about everything else. In traditional Blizzard manner, this game is pretty much bug/glitch free and runs really really well, performance wise. It is however very apparent that Blizzard has no experience making FPS games. The horrible netcode, cheesy free kill mechanics and lack of content really scream for f2p. I do understand the benefits of having a 40‚ price, as it will discourage cheating and will eliminate any sort of pay-to-win model, but trying to justify that price for a multiplayer only title that has as much content as Dirty Bomb seems hard.Nevertheless, this will be a fun game to play with friends, for a while. I wouldn't pay full price for it unless they add more free content in the future. If you are an FPS games, this game is probably not for you, as it seems to be more aimed at the MOBA people out there. I've played a lot of games but I would consider myself mostly an FPS games, and I can safely say this game is definitely NOT aimed at players like myself.\"
2016,Overwatch,"Let's start with the positive stuff.The gameplay of Overwatch is great.The maps, the heroes, the models, the abilities all play really fine.

The world is rather mysterious, but thanks to the cinematic shorts, comics and other posts, it's actually quite cool for a Shooter. I want to love this game really, really hard.But I can't.First of all, the matchmaking!Blizzard is notorious for their incompetent matchmakers. Heroes of the Storm was a huge failure because of it, despite HOTS having pretty damn awesome gameplay and design, the cancer that was matchmaking proved to be fatal to the game. One would think that the company learned from its mistakes. Nope. The game throws everyone together. Seasoned, highly skilled tryhards who are in it for the win and teamplay, and useless, noobcake newbies who will pick a 3rd sniper to cement your team's failuire. The teams are rarely ever balanced. One team usually stomps the other. Virtually every single game is full of frustration and stress. I tried to cling onto hope so hard that I gave the game more than 50 hours played hoping that the matchmaking will get a bit better, but nope, it didn't. To make things worse, there is no ranked play. Why would any developer release a competitive team based game without ranked play? That's the point of the whole game. It's like, selling a car without a motor: ""Here's your car, we don't have your motor yet, but in the meantime you can sit in it, or you can pretend to dive it!""Did I mention high latency? In most online games I have 20-25 ms ping. In overwatch the lowest I've seen is 40-45, but it usually is 60-70.The server communicates with the clients 20.8 times per second. So, everything you do in the game happens on that other guy's monitor about 0,1 seconds later. That's a lifetime in a fast paced FPS shooter! You will get shot by snipers and everybody all the time despite the fact that you were already in cover on your machine. It's a joke.I played plenty of multiplayer FPS games in my life. I used to be a Quake1 player, touched Q3, Quake Live, the COD and Battlefield series, the UT series and so on, but those games were FUN. Overwatch has a much better gameplay, but the matchmaking nullifies every bit of that so hard that I have to arrive to the conclusion:I never had such an awful online experience in my life.\"
2016,Overwatch,"Generic shooter with AAA price tag, released with major balance problems and low on content. Wait 1-2 years till it ll be finished. Overall, it's a shame for now."
2016,Overwatch,"Could've been a good f2p game you can enjoy with your friends. Instead it became a mediocre FPS with little to no content, minimal playerbase and the worst micro-transactions and loot systems you can think of."
2016,Overwatch,Pass on this. Nothing new except maybe the art style of the game is pretty good. Should have been a free to play game with the option to pay for the skins. Needed a single player mini campaign or something to add some story for each character. Multiplayer matches are quick and for the most part fun but it's get pretty boring quickly.
2016,Overwatch,"Possibly one of the most over-hyped shooter ever released. You read many websites praising how awesome the beta was and then you get to game itself and you will realize there isnt much to be praised about overwatch.Game features 21 heroes with lots of unlockables.

You read many websites praising how awesome the beta was and then you get to game itself and you will realize there isnt much to be praised about overwatch.Game features 21 heroes with lots of unlockables. Each hero has an interesting passive and a set of cool abilities but many of heroes are either over-powered ATM or either or with such a low skill cap they do an insane amount of damage which results in ez 1v3 in games. I feel like the game is not in a playbale estate and needs lots of re balancing in terms of abilities ratios.Secondly the game doesnt have much content. aside from tones of unlockables, maps and heroes will be summarized in about 1 hour. The rest of your time will be spent on playing the similar modes again and again. Although i should say the maps and their layers are awesome! may be one of the best map designs ever.But the actual concern for me comes in when you can switch heroes in the game. When such a features exist then what is the definition of mastering a certain hero or a roll. as far as I have played either no1 wants to support or we see 2 bastion in single game. I feel like in terms of choosing heroes the game should locks it for 1 choice and one champ per a game, this way the team will be enforced to a better team building and teamwork.Lastly, the game doesnt have much content, but I hope blizzard updates it with free new modes and maps and perhaps new heroes and features. After seeing what it has to offer the rest of your time will be spent on understanding maps, item locations and mastering a hero regarding their abilities in respect to the team and map itself. But I fink this will not be possible for every1 since the game allows you to switch freely between characters. Like i said this decision questions if mastering a hero or a certain roles matters at all. Perhaps only for team games, other than that the quick game mode of Overwatch is a chaotic and frustrating set of short gameplay which teaches you nothing and rewards you wit nothing as well. Other than this I will not recommend This game if you fink this will satisfy your love for MOBA games as a FPS shooter. Its a game with a very low skill cap IMO. As a person who has played League of legends for over 4 years with Master Tier, I am pretty sure I do have a good understanding of skill cap and over powered factors in respect to heroes.\"

If you stick with a favorite character you will not unlock items for that character any faster. If you thought 'Evolve' and 'Rainbow Six Siege' were small games, then you'll be even more annoyed with this.The most galling part is that the character design and core gameplay are really well done (hence the 4). They couldn't have spent time on a story mode like in a fighting game, where you play through matches with bots to get each character's backstory? Nope. Supposedly Blizzard has already announced free DLC for this game, hopefully it's, I don't know, maybe the option to select what type of match you want to play? Right now your only option is zone capture or moving zone capture. Definitely not worth $60.\"

See below)-Beautiful game design, smooth operation-Great and easy to use group featureCONS:-Horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, HORRIBLE map design. Perhaps some of the worst maps ever made into a shooter game can be found in Hanamura, Temple of Anubis and Volskaya Industries. These maps are comically easy to defend, and require a level of total and complete team competence to attack that is all but unheard of in a pub setting.-Similarly, cheese defense is way too easy and way too effective. Yes, heroes like Bastion and Torbjorn may be counterable in theory, but actually going out and breaking their line of defense on the game's atrocious maps is perhaps the hardest task I've ever come across in a video game-Overtime is similarly a very poor design. Losers become winners and winners become losers because of it. Often times in the control point modes, a team will hit 99% but they will not win because of their defenses finally cracking during the game's ludicrously rewarding overtime.-20 tick servers are awful, you will get hit around corners a lot-Because of the issues above, the game is about as competitive as a game of catch-low amounts of content but I'm not scoring on this because it's definitely going to change as the game evolvesOverall, I give overwatch's current state a 4/10. It isn't anything spectacular and is plagued by a number of nuisances that just aren't suitably beatable for pub play. That being said, it's a great amount of fun and it will definitely stick around for a while.\"

The graphics are gorgeous and the control is smooth and responsive. Finding a match is easy and quick usually. The characters designs are interesting and their powers are impactful and fun. Why is this game not a 10/10 like some of the critic reviews, you may be asking yourself.Overwatch has several shortcomings (knowing Blizzard these will be fixed in time) that hold it back from a full recommendation to all gamers. For one this game is only a multiplayer online shooter, so you are subject to other people's success and failure as much as your own and that can be frustrating at times, especially considering the amount of teamwork required. One guy who refuses to change classes to help the team can lose you the game. If no one wants to play tank or healer, well, good luck winning. Also, there a decent amount of maps, but the game could certainly use more.If you're not the type of FPS fan that likes to like of things like strategy and meta, than this may not appeal to you. If you're very competitive, this may not appeal to you, as you can only control 1/6 of the outcome of the game, unless you make a team with your friends. Finally if you want a story mode or something novel other than standard multiplayer matches you can find elsewhere you may be disappointed.People that love online competitive TEAM shooters, will love this game, but many people will get bored quickly as there isn't a whole lot of modes (yet) or things you haven't seen before. Its solid and very well made, as is tradition with Blizzard, but it's lacking reasons for FPS vets to change over from there game of choice other than being a fun, by the numbers experience.

Something close to 90 USD. Considering the amount of content, this game should be F2P. So that's a terrible move by Blizzard. If it wasn't for the price, I'd easily give this game a 9.- Some unbalanced combat situations. Some might argue that I just didn't learn how to effectively counter some specific characters yet. Indeed, I'm still learning so I can't tell for sure, but at first, some classes feel way stronger then others.- 20 Hz tick rate? Choose Tracer and don't stop moving. You're pretty much invincible. Those hit boxes, man.- Being so casual has it's price. The game just released but the lack of more complex game modes and rankings will probably make me grow tired of this pretty soon. There's nothing that forces me to come back and pick up from where I left off. No career progression, nothing.But what it desperately really needs is more content.

You don't actually get to customize your load-out or anything like you can with Team Fortress.I think I'll be trying out Battleborn again once the majority of the technical issues have been fixed. Right now I believe Overwatch is absolutely not worth the asking price and you should wait unless competitive shooters are really your thing. Overwatch doesn't try to do anything innovative or different for that matter compared to similar objective based shooters.Is it fun? Yes, when your team is playing with the correct heroes.The caveat: You will be utterly annihilated if just one or two people from your team play the wrong characters.It's a very unbalanced game by design it seems, I can see what Blizzard were going for but in practice matches simply revolve around playing the correct character more than actually playing well. Heroes which aren't defenders cannot do much good on their own which is to be expected but requires complete team co-operation which is an unrealistic expectation unless you're playing with friends.I don't recommend this game unless you have friends you're willing to play and co-operate with.\"

The game is very polished, and runs incredibly well even on very low powered hardware.Movement is fluid and fast, and the shooting is satsfying.Heroes are really distinct and have their own personality and gameplay. No hero plays the same like another.  Also, since i have seen this online lately, disregard anyone who complains about hero balance and about cheesy tactics that are somehow ""unbeatable"". This is clearly a ""learn to play"" issue. I played the Beta a lot, and let me tell you, that balance is in a very good place, though could be improved even more. Everything has its counters.While this game has only 12 maps right now, and it is repetitive, it manages to stay fun and interesting for a surprisingly long time. The main reason for this is that the game has immense depth under the casual-friendly appearence, it is one of those easy to learn but very hard to master games. There is always something new to try and learn. And the competitive aspect of the game will keep you coming for more.The main downside of this game, is that if you have no friends to play with, you won't get nearly the same satisfaction with those who do have their own party. This game is heavily based around teamwork and tactics. You can still find success solo, of course, but will be more difficult.Other than that, the game deserves its price. Totally recommended.\"

Overwatch draws heavily from Team Fortress 2, which isn't a bad thing because TF2 is an amazing game. Unfortunately there simply isn't as much depth to this game as there is in TF2 with only 12 maps and 2 game modes (yes, I know there is technically a 3rd mode, but it is just a mashup of the 2 game modes).Despite the varied cast of playable characters, the game gets repetitive quickly.  Especially since a lack of balance means you'll be seeing the same heroes over and over, sometimes 2-3 at once, each and every game.  Yes, hero stacking is a thing.  Additionally, there isn't enough of a payoff for mastering higher skillcap heroes when playing a lower skillcap hero can be more effective (looking at you Bastion).Another issue I had is the lack of a story.  Blizzard put a lot of time and effort into the animated shorts it released in order to set up the story for Overwatch.  Yet, in the game there is not hint at any story, largely because there is no single player campaign, which this game is just begging for.  It's a puzzling decision, and makes it all the more awkward when your team consists of characters heroes and characters that are villains.  Why are they fighting together?  No idea.  To me, this represents a lost opportunity for a game that truly could have been special.Then there is the elephant in the room, the price.  At $60, the content provided feels more like a free to play game than full on AAA release like Call of Duty, where at $60 you get a single player campaign, a lot more multiplayer modes, and a compelling unlock/leveling system.  Oh, and did I mention Overwatch even has microtransactions?  The content and value simply isn't there to justify the price of Overwatch.  I have no doubt the game will sell millions by virtue of the fact it is a Blizzard product, but it's sad that the company that gave us the Warcraft, Starcraft, and Diablo franchises isn't even giving players a fraction of the content that a $60 price tag should include.Disclaimer: Blizzard does offer a $40 version of the game for PC, but they don't widely advertise that fact and actively try to upsell you on the $60 version in a rather misleading fashion.\"

You will get many in game saying that Reinhardt is OP, but there's easy counters to him that will subsequently shut him down easily. Each character can be very strong in different scenarios, but there are definite counters to each. TorbjÃ¶rn also comes to mind on defense.

For example, characters standing near debris, slanted walls, etc will adjust their feet's physical location so that it makes sense, as in no one appears to just be floating. Equipment, hair, earrings, pretty much anything that would have physics when people move does. The sounds and animations are incredibly varied and smooth on every character, and mechanical parts move in an incredibly realistic way.That being said the game is still in it's infancy stage of release. So the content, while they claim to be expanding soon, is pretty bare right now- even if all of the characters are varied and super fun to play.There are some minor balance issues and matchmaker will probably see some improvements over time.All in all, while resembling TF2 in a few ways (Route 66 map, the game mode types...) it's variety of enjoyable heroes, level of polish, price point with loads of free content promised over this summer, and the Blizzard IP behind it- Overwatch will only gain traction from here on out.\"

I mean even for the casual gamer who only plays mobas, counter strike, or some free p2w mmo giving it a 10 is just too much.Don't get me wrong. Overwatch is not a bad game. On the contrary, it can be quite enjoyable at first with its colorful graphics, tight gameplay and limited but quite balanced character rooster. Even more so if you play it with a couple of friends. But there are only so many things one can do in an online only (60$ no singleplayer...wtf?) game with very few stages and extremely limited game modes. I do believe that eventually you will get tired of the game's repetition but then again I might be underestimating the casual gamer. And what's up with those disgusting rng boxes? Ok so they might not be mandatory because they will only give you cosmetic upgrades but it's still like blizzard is begging for more of your money. First it was day one dlcs and microtransactions then season passes and now we get multiplayer only games like Battlefront, The Division (don't tell me about its singleplayer missions) and now Overwatch. I wouldn't even mind about all that but see, people are buying these games giving the greedy developers motivation to make more of the same since these are the games that sell the most.It's all very sad. Not because these repetitive multiplayer games are overshadowing other worthwhile or even great singleplayer games that have been crafted with much care and love by their developers. Not even because these despicable exercises of greed are becoming a trend in Î± declining gaming industry. What saddens me the most is that most of these casual gamers will probably never bother giving a chance to all those wonderful games that already exist and will instead keep on with their lives as they have. But then again it might just be me that doesn't  get the point of multiplayer games like overwatch. There is one thing however that I think we call all agree upon. In a full priced game wouldn't it be nice to have the best of both worlds, both multiplayer and singleplayer, so that everyone can be happy? I say yes.\"

On the one hand, the goofy characters and frenetic gameplay lead to some good experiences where you have fun. On the other hand, the game lacks any sort of serious depth and I struggle to play it for hours at a time like I did with Team Fortress 2.Instead of having different loadouts like Team Fortress 2, Overwatch deigns to have many more characters with different abilities which more or less takes the place of the different weapons from TF2. This is fine and it does a great job of making each character unique, but many of the abilities have some serious flaws. Many ultimate abilities for example, can and will essentially destroy an entire enemy team with little counterplay. For example, one hero has an ultimate ability that will aim for you automatically as long as the opposing champions are on your screen. Another hero's ultimate ability automatically fires unavoidable damaging blasts at all hero's in a radius around him. These overpowering abilities detract from an otherwise enjoyable experience.The lack of game modes and maps is also a concern. With only two game modes (Domination with a single point and a Payload-style mode), the game quickly becomes repetitive, exacerbated by the comically small amount of maps for a FPS (12 maps). The game is desperately in need of more content to justify the price tag.By far the largest complaint I have, however, is how short matches are versus the time required to get back into a game. It is common to wait around 30 seconds to get into a match, then you spend another 60 seconds while everyone chooses their character, then you spend another 60 seconds while the defenders set up. At the end of the game, you spend around 30 seconds voting for the best team contributor, and another 30 seconds watching the ""play of the game."" This is in addition to any loading times while the game chooses the map or finds new players to fill a game after others have left. After all of this has occurred - the game has the potential to last just 5 minutes if a team struggles. At it's maximum, most games of Overwatch rarely last longer then 10 minutes. In my humble opinion, the best way to counter this is to introduce longer game-modes such as the popular ""tug of war"" style maps from Team Fortress 2.Despite these flaws, Overwatch definitely has some charm, and it's easy to see the love put into the game - Blizzard are definitely masters at creating appealing games. The characters are likable enough and the maps are mostly satisfactory. It's a game that I tried very hard to love and in the end I found the experience simply ""OK"".If you are looking for a successor to Team Fortress 2, the game fails to deliver a satisfying experience. I would recommend waiting for a sale before investing in this game, and I definitely would not recommend this game for folks who are easily frustrated.\"
2016,Overwatch,"Outstanding game, it's going to be a huge success for Blizzard and push eSports even further. The maps are well made along with an excellent cast of characters.

The balancing tactic relies on ""making everybody strong"", and making everybody ""OP"" instead of attempting some skill-based balance. Where that design philosophy can work in MOBA's like Dota 2 and to an extent League of Legends, Blizzard drops the ball here.Simply being on the attacking team puts you at an astounding disadvantage. There are no counters for abilities that make players invincible, nor a defending team composed for tanks. The first two minutes of the game revolve around getting the payload to the final point, and the rest is devoted to trying in vain to end the game.Problems that existed in the beta have not been solved. What was brushed off as ""Oh it's just a beta release"" has become ""They've voluntarily and knowingly released this product for full price.""If EA and Ubisoft damn themselves into early graves through poor practices, Blizzard has no excuse.Wait for a sale, if anything at all.\"

Also nice to have finally 60fps and 1080p on consoles in a top game. Also great to have a game without the needless story telling that has become standard in modern games. If you come up with a story with the quality of Witcher 3 than a story is worth telling. But most games and shooters dont get close to such a high level. So than skip the entire story telling. I dont want to watch the needless movies that only interrupt gameplay. I think Bethesda really did a great job here. Graphics are great. Gameplay is great. And I also liked the diffculty levels. I grew up as a PC gamer with keyboard and mouse. This was my first shooter with a controller. But the low difficult setting is perfect. Difficult enough to be challenging. But not so difficult that I want the mouse back. Perfect balance. Like any game DOOM des have negative points. But they are small. Forst of all the gameplay is sometimes interrupted by seeking way to long to enter new environments or find keys. Especially in a game like this that downgrades the gameplay. And the background music of the game could have been much better. The game could also have a more fear in it.. But the addictive fast shooting experience eliminates th negative aspects. Bethesda did a good job here. Better than I expected to be honest.\

Could it have been better and have the potential to be the perfect Doom game? Perhaps...The multiplayer was great, but the loadouts limited itself from becoming an incredible arena multiplayer game, (since everyone is now sick of CoD). I love the fact that you can use the demons in multiplayer. It makes the multiplayer a lot more intense and unique, but just like everyone else who complained about the beta, the demons are overpowered. Here is an example: The Revenant is actually fair to fight if your out in an open area, but if your running through a hallway and it pops out of nowhere and takes one shot at you.. you're dead. How is that even remotely fair? But as I said before, for the long run, multiplayer great. It still feels like a classic arena shooter with new perks added. It's brutal, fast, and fun!The campaign was beyond amazing! The game play honestly exceeded my expectations, it's so much fun! Now Doom (for the most part) is all about metal music and fast pace action with blood and gore flying in the air. The game does an amazing job delivering that, but it's also about being terrifying, and the game doesn't deliver that. The original game was fast pace and intense, but was also terrifying and disturbing. The new Doom isn't scary at all, but I'd rather have all out intense action over survival horror (we're looking at you Doom 3). That's honestly my only complaint with the campaign, I'm extremely satisfied with it. It feels like the original Doom, and yet feels like a FPS that no one has ever played before.Snap map is a great perk added to the game, but it wasn't as good as Id software said it was. It's very easy to use and you can customize the logic of the game, which I absolutely love about it! Only real complaint is that all the map structures are only UAC based, not hell and mars based. Wish you would've been able to create geographical features for the mars surface and would have hell themed structures. (It's kind of unfair that I'm criticizing this, since I've only created one map and there are like only two games that actually have this feature. But I felt like I had to throw in my two cents into this.)Here's the summery of the reviewPros +Fast-pace and brutal game playGlory kills are the cherry on top of the fantastic game playEnemies look awesome and fight brutallyBoss fights are surprisingly greatNo cut scene bull crap, and yet tells a really neat storyMission secretsBeautiful graphicsUAC and Hell textures look classic and goregeousMultiplayer game play is an arena shooter throw backMultiplayer modes are fun and uniqueMultiplayer Demons are fun to play asAwesome slection of weapons for campaign and multiplayerSnapmap is very easy to useChange logics in SnapmapHuge catalog of options in SnapmapCons -Multiplayer loadoutsDemons are overpowered in multiplayerNot as scary as previous Doom gamesSoundtrack sounds more electronic than metalNo geometric editing in SnapmapNo hell themed structures in SnapmapI know it sounds like I'm hating on a lot of things in this game, but I'm not at all, I'm just picking out every single flaw I found in the game to show you guys what you possibly wouldn't like about the game.

2016,Doom,"Let me start by saying this review is solely in regards to the multiplayer aspect of this title.  My time with the campaign has been limited and quite frankly, I didn't make the purchase to play through the story even though reviews of it have been mostly positive.Doom's Multiplayer is actually a bit challenging to critique.  When broken down component by component, you will find thereLet me start by saying this review is solely in regards to the multiplayer aspect of this title.  My time with the campaign has been limited and quite frankly, I didn't make the purchase to play through the story even though reviews of it have been mostly positive.Doom's Multiplayer is actually a bit challenging to critique.  When broken down component by component, you will find there are some aspects that seem to be lacking that extra something to take it from a good title to a great title.  With that being said, collectively the multiplayer experience is quite enjoyable even if at the end of the day it is somewhat basic when compared to other online shooters of this generation.  In actuality it may be that simplicity that makes Doom such a blast to play online.  Users aren't stuck endlessly customizing their load outs for every possible map and scenario, or caught up in needless weapon upgrade menus deciding which minuscule item to add to their rifle, the user simply hops in and begins to cause as much carnage as possible.The gameplay, while not exactly being top tier in regards to physics/mechanics, runs surprisingly smooth considering the sheer amount of craziness taking place at any given moment.  What do I mean by craziness?  To put it simply, Doom's beauty is in its chaos.  Whether you're in an object based game, or playing good old fashion team deathmatch, there will never be a shortage of flat out destruction taking place all around you.This is partially due to your weapon options.  While being somewhat limited in selection, Doom's guns are definitely one of its strong points.  From rocket launchers to mortar converting shotguns, players have enough options to create load outs that can range from an up close and personal game style to a more balanced mid range attack class.  Perhaps the best thing about these weapons is the fact that players can select any two they want for their load out.  There are no distinctions between a ""primary"" or ""secondary"" weapons.  What does this mean?  It means gone are the days of running out of ammo and having to run around with your little pistol between your legs, don't worry you have a second weapon that can be just as powerful as your first.The game's maps also add to the fast paced style of play.  Utilizing relatively small and close quarter designs with a good level of verticality gives players instant access to the action yet allows  just enough space for multiple playing styles.  Add in super weapon and demon spawns and you are left with a world where there is little escaping Doom's high level of violence, sorry campers.When it comes to customization, you're really only going skin deep however this is not a bad thing.  With an insane amount of armor options, and the color/pattern schemes that can be altered, users can be confident that no two players (at least aesthetically) will be alike.  Loadout customization is as straight forward as it gets, pick two guns and one piece of gear and go.  Not too much intricacy here, and there doesn't have to be.Overall Doom's multiplayer experience is straight forward and perfect for anyone who enjoys fast paced online shooters.  With never relenting action and violence, this game offers a good option to anyone looking to bulster their FPS collection.\"

Doom pulls no punches and it deliversThe time to Fight Like Hell has finally arrived, and it came with a bang. Doom is a return to basics shooter, and it shows us exactly how to reboot a franchise while maintaining all the fundamentals it was built upon in the first place.I can\t express enough the excitement I\ve experienced while playing through the Single Player Campaign for Doom. Doom pulls no punches and it delivers on an excessively violent and gory level. It manages to keep that horror film vibe, and while there isn\t a lot of tension when it comes to a scare factor, the fight for your own survival is what keeps your heart pounding. Doom continues throughout to relentlessly throw hordes of demons your way, not giving you an opportunity to slow down. However, there are key points in the game where you must think on your feet, because once you stop is when you die. I\m not going to go into the story at all, as I really want everyone to experience it for themselves. It\s not the most exciting story out there, but it works as far as Doom is concerned. \Id Software\ made it a point to show that gameplay is what matters this time. With each new weapon that I obtained, I began to feel more powerful. I tried to combine the use of multiple weapons throughout each level and it worked very well to my advantage. The ability to seamlessly switch between one weapon to another feels as smooth as butter and was obviously a great design choice.This game really goes out of its way to make you feel like the ultimate bad ass, and with each new weapon and upgrade, your frag count is sure to be staggering. As you progress, there are tons of secrets to be found, and to be honest, I missed quite a lot of them. Most of these secret areas allow you to upgrade either your health, armor, or your ammo capacity; or some allow you to gather an upgrade point for your weapons. The best part about all of this is that none of it is required to finish the game. It\ll make your life hell through your time spent in the game, but\ that\s the point, right?Let\s go into the multiplayer. There isn\t a whole lot to be said here about the multiplayer; especially if you\ve played pretty much any Call of Duty title out there. You level up, you earn different armor, and weapons and demons are locked behind that ugly \Level Wall\.  Doom\s multiplayer really feels like Call of Duty with a Doom Paint-Job. That\s not to say that it\s not fun, or just plain bad; We\ve just all been there before.One example is that with old school arena shooters, we\re used to finding weapons lying about the map we\re fighting on. Not this time. This time we\re forced to go by the dreaded \Loadout\ style, and pick two weapons to play with, and one type of grenade. It\s not a horrible way to go about this, but that takes away the title of \Arena Shooter\ and replaces it with \Arcade Shooter\, or...once again... \Call of Duty Shooter\. Now, I won\t sit here and tell you that I\m not having a blast with the multiplayer, because I am. I just wish it was a little more old school.However, what it lacks, it makes up for in speed. Doom\s multiplayer is extremely fast paced, which is part of what defined the arena shooter back in the day. Doom, Quake, and even Unreal Tournament were all apart of this at one point. Let\s hope it stays that way for future multiplayer shooters.So let\s move on to the final feature of the game. SnapMap. This mode allows you to design your own maps, more specifically, what type of game you create with that map. SnapMap allows you to make everything from DeathMatch to Extraction (Missions) to Survival. It\s a very intuitive tool that let\s you very easily create things you couldn\t before. I like to call it \Map Editor for Dummies\. There are tutorials that teach you everything you need to know to create the perfect masterpiece.I have just one problem with this extensive feature. Everything you create, you have to play in SnapMap mode. I want to be able to make a map, and release it to the community to play in Multiplayer! I don\t quite understand the logic behind id Software\s choice here, but I have a strong feeling that eventually SnapMap will die out. My suggestion would be that they allow, at the very least, the ability to release maps according to the modes available in Multiplayer. If that doesn\t happen, I don\t see SnapMap last very long. It\s an amazing feature that almost seems pointless.So here we are with a new Doom, and a new era of horror shooters. This total reboot shows exactly what made id Software the top dogs of their time, and that they\re still able to pull off something amazing. With the single player being the shining star, the multiplayer being a decent addition, and SnapMap which may or may not break itself, we have one very cool, and complete game. I recommend Doom to anyone a fan of shooters or not.Mike Taylor\"

I'm not saying mindless violence in the game is bad,  IDoom compared to many shooters I've ever played is the funnest out of all of them. Its speed, over the top gore, and powerful satisfying gunplay make up for a long satisfying play session. Its upgrade and customization system is a nice touch, which gives a fairly long 15 hour campaign of constant mindless violence a bit more depth. I'm not saying mindless violence in the game is bad,  I think the mindless action is tons of fun and addictive and their aren't many games that offer it, and is a nice breath of fresh air. Its just always nice to add extra content to make gameplay more interesting. You can upgrade armor and customize weapons. With armor you upgrade health, armor, and separate from that you can upgrade ammo capacity. The biggest part is weapon customization which add a useful secondary fire which also can be upgraded. There's also a perk like system where you complete challenges to earn perks that give you special abilitys. The enemies are very fast and fun to fight. The AI is pretty straight forward; spawn in a big group, run after him as fast as you can, move from his attacks, and hit him or shoot at him till he's dead. I had no problems with the AI at all because I feel its perfect for the kind of game it is. The reason is that these are demons from hell who are without any real human emotion, so thats why theyll kill till they die, and thats why they spawn in hordes. The gameplay is ment for fast instant combat without cover, and if the enemies ran away or hid behind cover when low on health it'll get rid of the flow of the game. It has a story thats kind of their, which I'm completely fine with because the original Dooms have never really had much at all an in depth campaign story. Doom has always been about crazy action and violence. What I got from the story is that it's  mysterious, strange, and at times disturbing. Its honestly telling more of a backstory of how it all happened, mostly though holograms of key events and environmental story telling.Even though Doom has most things right, their are some little flaws. With the weapons, theres a balanceing problem. I tend to almost always use the super shotgun, and I feel you get it a bit to early in the game so any other weapon you are useing at the begaining felt a bit useless. The other shotgun in the game, the combat shot gun is a bit too underpowered and even upgradeing it doesn't do much even after immediately finishing the early game levels. The super shotgun doesnt even have much to upgrade because of how O.P it already is. Even the rocket luncher is no much for the super shotgun. Even though balance is a bit of a problem, different weapons have different advantages. The super shotgun is the best at close quarter combat, the rocket launcher is best at range combat, the plasma and machine guns are best at very fast sweeping combat,  which is basicly just constantly shooting like crazy at groups of enemies. After doing the same glory kills the hole game it gets really repetitve and less satisfying but its a great way to get health and can speed up gameplay through perk like upgrades. That may have seemed like a lot of very negative stuff but their two very minor things you dont notice much.\"

2016,Doom,"Hell is literally taking over a secret Mars facility and the only one who can save humanity is this mysteriously overpowered, silent sentinel, who clearly needs no help and somehow manages to make an already gory scene even gorier. So what is our hero to do? Fight like hell! Doom is a throwback to when games didn't need to be bogged down with complex story-lines, cultural references, hugeHell is literally taking over a secret Mars facility and the only one who can save humanity is this mysteriously overpowered, silent sentinel, who clearly needs no help and somehow manages to make an already gory scene even gorier. So what is our hero to do? Fight like hell! Doom is a throwback to when games didn't need to be bogged down with complex story-lines, cultural references, huge set pieces, or crazy amounts of multiplayer content to be considered great. What you find instead is a wonderfully gory bad-ass death dealing experience.The goriest and most satisfying moments in Doom are found in its almost 13-hour campaign. While the actual story is rather bland, the combat is what compels you to keep plugging away at the game. Gone are the days where you\re forced to use cover and military tactics to complete your missions, Doom lets you actually live out an action movie. You\re motivated to move from enemy to enemy, dealing out enormous amounts of damage at every enemy in your path, arena style. Your Doom Guy doesn\t know when to stop. Your character moves at a ridiculously fast pace to creating a hectic sense of combat. You\re given tons of opportunities to use the environment within combat as well. Jumping from platform to platform is so seamless that it becomes second nature to bounce around for better combat vantage points.""You\re motivated to move from enemy to enemy, dealing out enormous amounts of damage at every enemy in your path, arena style.""Onto the guns! Aside from the main weapon choices in Doom, you also have a hand full of special weapons that offer a unique tool. You can finish off a horde of enemies with a single shot from the classic BFG or turn a single demon into a pile of gory giblets with the chainsaw. The chainsaw is easily the highlight of your special weapon choices. Not only do you witness one the bloodiest death scenes in a game, you also have a tool to save you from a situation where ammo is just not available. You get an instant, satisfying kill with your chainsaw and, out of the bloody carcass of whichever poor demon is on the receiving end of your beautiful weapon, you get a rain of ammo as a reward. Do you kill off the demon tossing rockets everywhere or do you save your fuel (which is located throughout a level for the chainsaw) for when your ammo supply begins to dry out?  Doom presents so many intense battles that your choices are all split second decisions that never feel too overwhelming.I found myself never utilizing the full arsenal at my disposal. The plasma gun felt a little under-powered and my poor pistol never saw the light of day unless I was completely out of ammo. After acquiring most of the weapons in the game, I came to realize that some weapons shared the same ammo pool. It was an interesting concept, but I felt forced to hold off using some inferior weapons so that I didn\t lose the ammo needed for the more interesting options. Everyone will have their own favorites, of course, but it felt a little too restrictive for me. The variety given each weapon is impressive with the upgrade system.""Every new area you visit is more impressive than the last.""Doom is split into three parts and the multiplayer is the black sheep in the bunch. There is a bit of a disjointed feel to the combat in the multiplayer side of Doom. My attacks didn\t feel as effective against live opponents, and I would have loved for some of that bad-ass feeling from the single player campaign to find its way into multiplayer. At times, you can pick up the demon power-up which was the highlight of my experience. Thrashing around and causing mayhem as a baron of hell never gets tiring. With that being said, it felt like far too much of an advantage. I played way too many matches where one team had the demon rune consistently throughout a match, and no amount of skill could overcome.SnapMap is by far one of the simplest tools to create imaginative gameplay that I have seen in a shooter. Snapping enemies, power-ups, environments, and all manner of goodness is a button click away. You never feel overwhelmed with your choices after working through the well-made tutorial. The SnapMap also allows you to share your custom games or explore amazing created content from players around the world. One of the best examples was a match I played where you faced endless waves of enemies in a \horde mode\ where communication and cooperation with other players is key. After having that much fun with such a simple SnapMap creation, I look forward to what other types of games the player base can create.________________________________________Rating 8.5/10+ Amazing single player campaign+ Great upgrade system: Weapons and Suit.+ Plenty of secrets and collectibles+ Intuitive create your own game feature \ SnapMap- Multiplayer can\t keep up with the single player- Some weapons needed more work to stand outRecommended for: fans of the original Doom, Gears of War or fast-paced shooters.\"

I have also tried multiplayer but it's early days and there was severe lag. I'm hoping this is improved with time (much like PS4's DriveClub) but early impressions are good - it's a no-frills old-school multiplayer game, just this time over the internet rather than serial-to-serial on PC in 1993.It's been said this game will mostly attract fans of the original DOOM and DOOM II and that's probably true, but if you want a 'no thinking just shoot' wrapped up with gorgeous graphics and gameplay, buy it!\"

2016,Doom,"I purchased Doom with a certain amount of reluctance. As with any remake of a classic, fan-favourite, game Doom had a lot to live up to and, after the abomination that was Doom 3, you could hardly blame me.Doom does not do cut-scenes; it does not need to pad itself out with stunning cinematics to lengthen it's story and detract from the gameplay.From the moment the game starts youI purchased Doom with a certain amount of reluctance. As with any remake of a classic, fan-favourite, game Doom had a lot to live up to and, after the abomination that was Doom 3, you could hardly blame me.Doom does not do cut-scenes; it does not need to pad itself out with stunning cinematics to lengthen it's story and detract from the gameplay.From the moment the game starts you are up to your eyes with undead and demons alike. Near the story of my journey I found myself wondering whether this constant flow over enemies attempting to wash over me would get tiresome. It didn't. It got more entertaining, more intense, and, in some cases, more hilarious.Visually the game looks fantastic; from the lighting and environment effects, to the general feel of the environments you're in.The sound effects are brilliant, thought I concede my least favourite is when I'm too caught up n the action and a noise sounds to alert me to my dangerously low health.Gameplay-wise, it just feels like someone has taken my beloved childhood game and brought up to the visual standards of 2016, with a few querky extras along the way.It has to be, hands down, one of the best FPS games I have played in a long time.Every weapon is perfectly balanced in terms of output, making your choice of weapon more situational than simply because it's overpowered. The exception being the BFG, ofcourse.The story is subtle. I fully understand what's going on at all times, and I'm interested to learn more as the game progresses, but it does not force you to watch cut-scene upon cut-scene.The multiplayer is an intense assortment of game modes, most of which you'll have experienced in other multiplayer online games. The balancing of the guns translates to the multiplayer, meaning every gun has its own pros and cons, without there being one clear winner. Though you can never go wrong with shotgun.Doom's interesting spin on your tactical throwing items is incredibly fun to play around with. We still have the classic Frag grenade, but you can also enjoy a personal teleporter, tesla greande, siphon grenade, energy shield wall, and more!There is nothing funnier than throwing your personal teleporter over an enemy combatants head, as you face them in head to head combat, only to appear behind them and unload a double barrel into their spine.Oh, and did i mention Demons? A demon buff will spawn every pre-fixed amount of time throughout a round and the first person to read said buff becomes the demon they have selected for their current loadout. If you're fortunate/quicker enough to become the demon try to avoid being killed, if the enemy kills you before the buff expires naturally they can pick it up and then terrorise you for a short period.So in summary; Doom has far exceed any initial expectations I had for the game. I bought it without any real conviction but it has kept me enticed since I started playing. If, like me, you're tired of the same COD-style shooters that we seem to be inundated with, get Doom. It's not all that often I enjoy both multiplayer and campaign.Oh, and it has a chainsaw.\"

There's almost no story - just go and kill some demons in the most glorious way you can. There's some explanation to Doomguys motives and story later on but it is unobtrusive. You just want to play it, you don't have to force yourself.Weapons are very satisfying except for pistol. You couldn't have come up with a **** pistol in a shooter even if you researched the subject and worked on it for years. Fortunately, you get shotgun after 10 first demons and never come back to pistol ever again.Glory kills are fast and unobtrusive gorefests you'd expect. They look stunning but after a while are a tad repetitive which is really non-issue. You can disable them altogether in settings (or just disable the color marking on demon). You can also configure the game to display weapon model in the middle of screen just like in original Doom (really cool).Soundtrack is just stunning. You should really check it out yourself on Spotify or YT. Mick Gordon has done amazing job. The music is not background to the gameplay but is rather forefront and drives the gameplay. He's also a cool guy, you might want to see a review with him on Doom on YT.Visuals are also very good. The rendering engine reminds me of Alien Isolation which I have praised for amazing materials work. Same applies here but is extended to amazing metallic and wet material effects. This is all thanks to PBR. However what is the most amazing about the graphics in Doom, is that despite it being one of the best looking games on PS4, it maintains 60FPS in Singleplayer almost constantly. I have experienced maybe 2-3 FPS drops throughout the campaign.The game is also full of secrets like Doomguy toys (which unlock weapon/enemy models in a gallery in main menu) and hidden classic Doom levels. Finding them is plenty fun but the joy is a little diminished once you find the map of the level. Secret areas are shown on the map so it's easy to find them. Some secrets are behind doors which need to be opened with a lever - the lever is not shown on the map though and is usually really well hidden.There are also many mods for your weapons. 1/3 of them I considered **** (scope in a machine gun? this is Doom!) but the rest is really useful and fun. You unlock them by finding bots throughout UAC complex. You can also enhance your own skills with Demonic Runes. These have to be unlocked by doing certain challenges on seperate maps (kill X enemies with Y in Z seconds and many more).Overall I enjoyed this game a lot more than I expected. It would be 9.5 if it was possible due to the minor gripes I mentioned. I absolutely recommend this game to all Doom and FPS fans.\"

DUDE!!! Nowadays there are NO GAMES skillwise like quake was!!! Wake up!! You are an ignorant - dont write about things you have no idea. Install Q1/Q2/Q3 on Your PC and try duel anyone who can play those games - Youll loose without getting any frags and youll die over 50 times in 10 minutes! These games are pure skill, nothing like post COD/BATTLEFIELD massive campfest, airstrike, bland noskill multiplayer titles. And the difference between multiplayer in Q1 (ultra fast gameplay), Q2 (slow, more tactical approach) and Q3 (mix of the first two) is also groundbreaking!Ok, thats enough about old Quake games, on to the DOOM. Its quite fresh, with definitelly fun frentic action, maybe a bit too chaotic - especially in multi, which seems also a bit more skill oriented than battlefields - cant say more about that, because modes involvig over 4 players playing simultaneously are too chaotic and playing fps shooter on game pad is pointless - skill starts witch attaching mouse and keyboard.Also I would love to see some global ladders/ranks in place of stupid perks (dumbest thing in multiplayer, where newbies are handicapped not only from being fresh to the game, but also have worse equipment/skilsets). Besides why do You start with good weapons? If they want to stay true to their roots, then we should all start with standard pistol on respawn, and grab weapons from strategic points on map - this was always giving maps A LOT of tactic and was the main reason that the knowledge of arenas were key points to win the match. Now only accuracy and proper weapon choice counts...Single player campaign is really nice, mindless, adrenaline pumping fun. And yeah it really feelgreat to clear difficult area of monsters. Glory kills are nice but what the hell are they doing in multiplayer part? Upgrades in single player campaign are also nice idea. For me its even better than the first 2 doom games back in their days. I am also aware, that those were turning point for gaming industry and the newest one is just a good, but forgetable game.Overall the game is great. I am complaining, but I have to face it - market changed, nowadays nobody wants to play really skill oriented multiplayer fps games. But You probably will enjoy this title a lot, because of sheer fun it gives. One of the best fps experience in a long time.\"

I remedied this by taking a break from the campaign and trying multiplayer for a bit.  Doom's multiplayer isn't the greatest around and seems to even be lacking in the content department but it is definitely a good change of pace from the campaign, and I would say that if I was any good at pvp in the first place I probably would have liked it a lot more.

It expertly combines little shout outs to long time DOOM fans with a mix of the new that results in a tight controlled shooter with that classic DOOM vibe still strong in the gameplay. While some may criticise the game for upgrade point in your weapons and armor, I found it to be a welcome addition that added meaning to exploration in the, as I've heard it called, ""laberyintian environment."" While the single player felt worth the $60 price tag alone, I would have liked to just see a few more campaign missions to extend the playtime of the game that truly excels. Because the multiplayer and snapmap feature are disappointing. While the snapmap feature is robust and offers a lot of cinematic options, I found that it wasn't user friendly. It may be just me, but for the life of me I can't get the effects to play out the way I want if at all even after an hour of playtime. I think personally the creatives maps of the game's fanbase will have to be what I rely on for the fun of the feature rather than making the maps myself. And the multiplayer...Well it's there alright. You can't take that away from it. Because there really isn't much you could take away from it if you wanted to. It feels like it wants to be something it's not, and that is some sort of hybrid Call Of Duty clone that just feels wrong somehow. It isn't terrible, but if you are looking for a game to play with your friends, the multiplayer gets old pretty fast and doesn't offer much variety.All in all I'm glad I bought this game though. It's the first in a long string of losers I have bought for PS4 that finally reminded me why I bought one in the first place. I've had the time of my life trying to Platinum the game and find all the secrets and I think any long-time DOOM fan will love this game.\"

It is simple and mindless full action shooter and as a shooter, it is damn good. No camping in a cover for half an hour, just take weapon, run and shoot. Therefore, I will rate it for what it is. Gameplay is full of action, low resting time between hordes of demons and overall left big satisfied smile on my face. Though some jumping scene god bit on my nerves, but it has more to do that I used to play those games on pc (playing with controller is hard for me).Campagna is decent length, not too long (what makes me usually quit the game before I finish it) and not too short. There is not much, what you can say about it, since it is go and kill demons and find secrets darning jumping scenes. On the other hand multiplayer left mixed feelings. I am not sure if in game like doom progression system is the way to go, but the action and game itself is actually fun.In short, the game has beautiful graphics, a lot of gore, adrenalin full action gameplay and good music.\"

Going back to what made the original great, it focuses on being fast and fluid, possessing rewarding and cathartic combat that's fast and brutal and bloody. Killing demons isThis is DOOM. Straight up. There's no nonsense here. It's intense, aggressive, and is an adrenaline fueled joyride from start to finish that never lets you go for an instant.DOOM is the game DOOM 3 wishes it was. Going back to what made the original great, it focuses on being fast and fluid, possessing rewarding and cathartic combat that's fast and brutal and bloody. Killing demons is an absolute joy to behold, and tearing through the hordes makes you feel like an absolute badass.The story is who the f*** cares? You kill demons, that's it. Kill ALL the demons. Well, okay, there IS story, and actually not a bad one, though your involvement in it is not much more than a torrent of destruction and carnage that can't be stopped by anything. The DOOM Marine is, ironically, passive in the narrative as a whole, being more of a side character, despite being the bane of all of Hell. The story fluff is contained in the codex, which has detailed descriptions on lore and characters and locations and demons and all that, which you can read any time you want if you care about that kind of thing, something the DOOM Marine couldn't give a flying demon's lower jaw about. He's there for one thing; to kill demons. A lot of demons. ALL the demons, preferably.The gameplay, as stated before, is fast and aggressive. No cover based shooting here, folks. Combat is reliant on having quick feet, quick reflexes, and quick trigger fingers, requiring nerves of steel as you tear your way through the legions of Hell's minions. The game's main addition to combat is the ""glory kill"" system, which is not an innuendo, trust me. Weakened demons can be finished off with a pre-animated takedown move, which thankfully is quick and stylish, never breaking up the fast paced flow of combat with a huge overdone cutscene like other games tend to do. You'll take off a demons arm and smack them in the face with it and then jump to the next demon to kick his legs out from under him and punch his face into the floor within the course of a few seconds, and it all blends in perfectly. Performing these moves will yield health, providing incentive to take demons down in this method, allowing you to keep up the fight and keep the pressure on as you rip and tear your way around the combat arenas.The game also harks back to the original games by featuring open ended maps that focus on key hunting, also having many collectibles to track down and collect, which is what you usually do with collectibles. The promise of weapon and armor upgrades as well as additional health, armor and ammo capacity properly incentivises exploration through the sprawling maps, looking for secrets that can be anything from the listed above, to even original DOOM levels, complete with original 8-bit graphics that are fully playable.The weapons are just as satisfying as the combat. All of them, save the starting pistol, are brutally effective at eliminating Hell's legions, and all are viable options... except the starting pistol. Unlocking secondary firing modes gives new combat options, ranging from a grenade launcher for your shotgun to micro-missiles for your assault rifle, to a stun bomb for your plasma rifle to a lock-on function for your rocket launcher. All of these can be upgraded individually through upgrade points you earn through the game for finding secrets and killing demons in order to increase their effectiveness, and doing so allows you to outright destroy even the most powerful demons. The weapons are practically in this for the same reasons you are; to kill demons.The DOOM Marine himself is also worth mentioning. Despite not having a single line of dialogue, he is one of the most charismatic characters I have ever seen in any game. Simply through first-person gestures, you see what kind of person the DOOM Marine is, his personality conveyed entirely through his interactions with the world and with other entities in it, and it speaks volumes. The DOOM Marine has more character and personality through action alone than so many other video game characters that have hundreds of lines of dialogue to work with and just end up being bland and generic. The DOOM Marine is two things: he's angry, and he HATES demons. Not the most complex character, fair enough, but the sheer personality infused into the character just through his actions make him so likable. The first bits of dialogue in the game, being an expository monologue by the main corporate guy, is interrupted by the DOOM Marine grabbing the monitor and tossing it aside, because he couldn't care less about what's going on around him. He's there for one thing, the thing that his whole existence revolves around, and the same reason you're here as well. To kill demons. ALL demons.I could go on for hours about this game, but I'll leave it at this: this is DOOM. It pays homage to the original games without licking its boots, and stands proudly as a worthy successor to its legendary heritage.\"

While the gore, lack of an intriguing story and First-person action may not suit well with some people. The point is that Doom is an insane, fast-paced, traditional FPS that does exactly what it should, and people who love FPS games (like me) will absolutely adore this game.

The faster you kill, the more recklessly you play, the more your rewarded, not just with showers of health (and later armor), but also in spectacular death animations that just don't get old.All this and it's FULL of well hidden and fun to find secrets, an intuitive yet interesting weapon/armor upgrade system, remade retro levels to find and murder your way through, and one of the most well optimized, bug free experiences I've had from an AAA title maybe ever.This game is worth every penny for the campaign mode alone, and then there's the SnapMap feature which I hear is already turning out some quality content. And multiplayer, if that's your thing (it's not mine...but I don't mind at all cause the single player is so good).So if your idea of a great time is crouching behind waist-high walls and waiting for health to regen while the enemy ineffectually attempts to shoot you from long range, look elsewhere.

Everything was over the top scary, nerve racking and most of all, fun! I always wondered why a publisher never remade Doom properly, well finally someone has taken on the task and to me, they did a great job! Better than I could of asked for. I recommend this game 100%. Let get into it.The single player campaign is ""DOPE"" yes I used the slang term dope from the 80's lol. It's that good... There is so much here and it's made in a way where you can play this game anyway you like. Let me explain. The single player game is offered two ways arcade, and well, campaign (lol). Arcade is just like it sounds, play for high scores with all weapons available. The scoring is done in a way where it's very exciting to watch, the screen goes crazy as you go for kill streaks, head shots and specific attacks to increase your score, its a total blast.There single player campaign is the meat and potatoes of this game. They did put a lot of effort in here. I want to first say that every level has a bunch of secrets to find. One being an original level of doom hidden to discover (fully updated with current character design in the old school level "" COOL"") on every level of the game. Besides that there are ""ruin trials"" for upgrades, items to find, keys to search for, weapon, armor upgrades and of course terrifying enemies constantly swarming at you. The levels are designed with precision for maximum gunplayability (is that a word). I love the map system, you can use 3D or 2D and it definitely helps. The enemies are all your old favorites updated, beefed up and on you, like stink on something smelly...lol. You get plenty of guns at your disposal most have secondary functions and can be upgraded. The weapons are so much fun to use, blasting enemies feels amazing, you must use skill, knowledge and know your enemies weaknesses or your a goner. Glory kills are new, I wont give to much away here, but cracking skulls never gets old...The levels are deigned like this, you get to a new area kill everything, then get some breathing time to explore, complete tasks and even do some platforming. Some people say the game is simple, but thats not true. Its a complex game, if you play it that way. It can also be a mindless shooter just ripping through enemies like in arcade mode... If this was the whole game it would satisfying, but thats only the first half of the title. There are two more modes.Multiplayer to me is tons of fun, they have team death match and the standard fare but they did add a few other modes in too. I like bots are included to play with, its old school multiplayer and I enjoy the heck out of it. You can upgrade your characters look as well as other attributes. Not much more to say about this mode, it's definitely worth playing and can be a blast is your into multiplayer.Snap map, whats this? I can make my own maps? Big deal? Well it is a big deal, in this game. I was shocked how versatile this mode is and how well it works. I played countless multiplayer matches on custom themed games (not all shooters) that the community designed. I can make my own games up too and there so easy to do! A tool like this can keep a game alive for years. You can make almost anything up you want here and its again done great. Its so user friendly. You can make single player, multiplayer, co-op whatever, you can make it in snap map. If making your own levels sounds boring or to difficult to you, you never have to, there are a ton already made up for you to use and their all rated right there in snap map. What can I say, jeez louise, easy peezy.Doom is an amazing package for both people who love nostalgia or just want a great shooter. Indeed old school doomers will appreciate the nods to the past while new players will marvel at the nonstop action , go doom go!\"

The game lasted about 15 hours for me, complete with long open ended maps the series is known for. Each of the 13 are ripe for exploration and are filled with secrets. Each levels consists of many open arenas filled with enemies where you test your skills in quick visceral combat requiring moment to moment reflexes. Luckily you have the classic Doom arsenal with a few newcomers. You get to carry all at once in classic fps tradition and switching through constantly is strategic to your current situation. The soundtrack packs a heavy punch as you fight through hoards of demons and the art direction is all pretty cool in my opinion, not to mention theres tons of easter eggs with little regerences to other games and films. Multiplayer is ok at best though, it doesn't feel right in a Doom game with loadouts and other modern trends. Overall it just gets old after a couple hours and I can't see myself going back to it. Snapmap is also very limited and gives little to the modding community so it will probably be abandoned by most. ID knocked this one out of the park after the disappointing Doom 3 and Rage just as Machine Games did with the new Wolfenstein games. If you want something new with a very nostalgic feel or just an amazing single player fps this new era of Doom is worth your hard earned cash.\"

I am playing on the  PS4 on a Sony 4K TV and this game is jaw dropping. The textures, lighting and particle effects are all some of the best I have seen this generation. The game runs in full 1080p( though my television does upscale the image to 4K) at a consistent 60 frames per second which is an unbelievable feat considering the graphical fidelity on display here. For anyone familiar with this series and arena style shooters in general, the decision to provide a consistent 60 frames is highly appreciated. The art design is also top notch. The weapon models are exceptional as are the environments which range from space station corridors, sprawling areas on the surface of Mars with lots of verticality as well as dreadfully beautiful locales in the depths of Hell. The game\s aesthetic is reminiscent of old heavy metal album covers and it is all very very cool.  The creature designs are also fantastic. There is a large variety from small grunt like demons who pepper you from a distance with hellfire balls to enormous demons with surgically attached machine gun arms. Very heavy metal indeed! The enemy AI is good. Foes are very aggressive and keep you on your toes. The game is fairly challenging at medium difficulty and downright Dark Soulsesque at the higher difficulty settings. The sound design does not take a backseat to the visuals. The game is powered by a driving heavy metal soundtrack which increases in intensity as the on screen action ramps up. Guns sound great and all of the ambient noises are top notch as well. Most importantly the gameplay delivers on every level. This is Doom. The speed of the game is the biggest factor here and it immediately sets Doom apart from any other shooter on the market. This game is fast. But the buttery smooth controls ensure that you have control over that speed at all times. This game is all about movement. Tactical concepts such as taking cover, regenerating your health, and picking your enemies off one by one will get you killed in Doom. Constant movement, good aim and an itchy trigger finger are your only methods of survival on Mars and in Hell. Movement is always a joy however, thanks to fantastic controls and a climbing system designed to navigate the environment with ease. Doom also introduces a Glory Kill system which consists of staggering an enemy with gunfire and then getting in close for a brutal melee kill. Since Doom sticks to its old school roots it does not feature regenerating health. Instead Glory Kills provide you with a small health burst for every enemy taken down in that fashion and it adds a great tactical aspect to the shooting formula and I found it to be a relatively small but very welcome addition. But this is Doom as you remember it and also what you imagined it would be like in 2016. In terms of story its completely serviceable. The gates of hell are accidentally opened on a remote research facility on the surface of Mars and it\s up to Doomguy to put his jet powered space marine boot up Satan\s behind. War and Peace this is not but if anyone wanted a super intricate story line complete with branching story paths and dialogue options simply does not understand what Doom is all about. You are here to kill demons and kill demons you do. In glorious fashion! Doom also includes a very user friendly SnapMap feature which allows users to create a variety of multiplayer, single player and co-op content which adds a lot of value and replayability since there is always something new to play. This game is an absolute blast. It is highly polished, infectiously addictive and I cannot put it down. I know many review sites have really knocked down the score because the multiplayer is not great but if you are interested in Doom for all of the right reasons I would highly recommend this title.\"

Now this Doom is latest addition for that list. I mean good single player first person shooter.So Doom is fast paced shooter like old Quakes and Serious Sam games. You move to A to B and kill bad guys on A and B and also along the way. The levels are mostly linear with few places where you can go check for secrets and explore though the main thing is on killing demons.And it is really fun to do it. You start with regular pistol and shotgun but then you start to build your arsenal more and more and almost each weapon has 2 mods that you can attach to weapon (shotgun has burst fire and explosive shells for and example). So that gives you plenty of choices how to rush into the battle.Also there is instakill Glory kill that you can enable when the enemy is staggered, gives you health when you need it. Chainsaw that uses fuel on use gives you ammo and 1 other special weapon that is a blast.Also your battle suit is upgradeable with basic max health, armor and ammo but also some modifiers for faster climbing etc. Then there are Runes (perks) that you get trough trial levels that has some kind of modifier to give some challenge.So there is loads of things that you can upgrade if you are into that sort of thing.Enemies all are different from each other. where the regular zombies just move slowly, imps throws you with fireballs and jumps around fast like a monkey. Only thing that is missing from enemy roaster is spiders from older games.There is a story and it's a simple one. Also there is some lore to read about places, monsters and weapons that I found interesting (I don't usually read those text collectibles).Also there is Basic multiplayer option that is ok and a snap map where you can build your own map or play the ones that other people have done. I didn't play those so can't say much about them.But Doom is good sp fps that I bet I'm gonna visit again and again like I did and do with Wolfenstein.\"

After the shift in tone that was had with Doom 3, DOOM recaptures the fast-action run and shootem' gameplay that made the first two Doom games so great.There is really quite a lot to love about DOOM. It does several things very well. The level design, structurally and visually, succeeds in maintaining interest and provides plenty of exploration opportunities, where you can find collectibles (especially the charming Doom guy dolls). This is a nice break from the break neck action that ensues in bursts, and which can admittedly can begin to wear you out if you play too much of this game in one sitting.The crazy action is accompanied by an operatic, devilish music score that nails the tone of the game, cueing at the right moments an orchestral blast that really gives the game a sense of polish and succeeds in making the player feel immersed.The story isn't overwhelming nor is it underwhelming. The game reaches a nice middle ground where it provides a feasible plot outline that doesn't obstruct from gameplay, and since the gameplay is intriguing enough, it is really a plus that the game isn't too story heavy. That being said, the story does supply some very epic fight sequences, and succeeds in making the player feel like an angry Doom guy who really just wants to blast every hellish fiend he encounters to a lower level of hell.The actual gameplay itself is varied due to the wide array of weapons and special equipment that the player throughout the game can eventually collect and use along his journey. The game as such is very much so a learn as you go kind of game, forcing the player to adapt to new situations and test which weapons work best against the wide gamut of enemy types.I was nervous about this game from its gameplay trailers where there appeared to be an incessant amount of fight animations. Luckily, as you play along, you notice less and less when these occur, and they actually serve a function in the gameplay itself (they drop health and ammo). Furthermore, they aren't necessary.The reason this game isn't scoring a 10/10 for me is its lack of local multiplayer. DOOM's multiplayer is really quite a joke, and it's a lucky fact that the developers didn't create a campaign that depended on it. It would have been nice to be able to play local multiplayer, like the old Doom games. Nevertheless, it's a relief to see a game that put all of its eggs into the right basket, unlike so many other games nowadays that are trying to do everything and succeed at doing nothing. DOOM's campaign is so genuinely fun that its lack of local player becomes somewhat insignificant.\"
2016,Doom,"Doom is unapologetic to what it dishes out to its players: a delirious sprinting and shooting all hell thrown at your face with no words, only loud ass sounds from your weapons and frenzy in your heart.

It's singleplayer is truly the best in terms delivering its gameplay front and center and not giving a dam about story or lore in the form of long winded dialogue dumps and expository jumble. It has exploration, collectibles and original DOOM maps thrown in to relive the golden days of that old tradition of FPS games. The music is simply badass, with shredding and high frequency electronic mixed making the experience of killing demons so dam amazing. The designs of the demons and such is pretty dam cool, and while the bosses are not the best, the constant killing and slaughter trivializes this. Glory killing is outstanding and so metal to do (though it can get old for some and completely understand this) that I'm glad it's an option. If DOOM had only its singleplayer, then it would be an easy 10/10 for me.But it does not. Multiplayer is the weakest part of DOOM, with a setup more catered towards Call of Duty, Halo and other FPS that DOOM inspired but was not along sides with at the time of its conception (like Wolfenstein 3D or Quake) and will be a ""tale of two games"" when playing. I think it is decent, but if there was  more effort put into its multiplayer style similar to Quake, it could easily crush alot of FPS online multiplayers. The Snapmap is a creative tool to allow you make maps and create little missions in them to share with your friends and the community. It is not as refined as say Forge like the Halo series, but it gives some creativity that will make you tinker with it and possibly make something cool.Overall, DOOM is everything I wanted in terms of a no nonsense campaign through Hell and Mars mired by some multiplayer issues and online things. It is definitely a game that deserves alot of praise for this and cannot wait to see the sequel.\"

This game delivers what it has delivered for years, making you, the gamer, feel like an unstoppable badass.Updated with modern graphics that are beautiful, a perk and upgrade system that balances out well, a challenge system that is optional to accelerate the pace of those upgrades, and the glorious easter eggs that slap you in the face with some great nostalgic levels from the classic games, this truly embodies a positive modern touch that does not harm the nostalgic feel of the game.Although, it has to be mentioned that the multiplayer is subpar, and while it does feel a little bit like Quake Arena, the balancing of the demons kinda throws everything off, and it gets tiring fast. Also, this game is nothing like Doom 3, it is more like a modernized Doom 2, so do not expect to be walking around with your flashlight and have imps jump from around corners and dark hallways. Oh, and you never have to reload.Positives:- Fast paced action- Great upgrade system- Beautiful graphics- Lots of guns (classics included)- Nightmare mode makes things interesting and tough- No other game will make you feel more like a badass- Classic level easter eggs and secrets are fun to find- Mick Gordon absolutely nailed this soundtrack- An amazing fps to help escape from the plethora of cut & paste fps games out these days- Snap map allows for users to share their creativityNegatives:- Story is linear and just background noise- Multiplayer won't entice you to return- Snap map creativity is limited by modding restrictions- No single player DLC :(Overall, this game is awesome. No other word I can use to truly describe it, it really is a standout for FPS games. I may have a slight bias towards Doom as it was one of the first games I ever played on my PC, but if you pick this one up, especially for the current price, you will not regret it. This is a must buy for fans of the series. It really does Rip & Tear itself away from garbage FPS games that are being released around it. This is one of the two games of 2016 that I thoroughly enjoyed and put countless hours into, and it easily receives a 90% (9/10) from me. BFG = Best F***ing Game. The other game is Uncharted 4 btw.\"

Doom3 was a strange game, it has an even better rating on metacritic for the PC original release (87, while this has 85), but the console releases have a 67 rating...  Doom3 is by some considered the definition of Horror FPS, with masterful atmosphere, and incredible tone and jumps, and by others, a spin-off or a slow paced wannabe.Found Doom 3 pretty fascinating, slow to get into, but definitely a unnerving experience with some incredible horror atmosphere and effects.  As if Doom grew up with the fans of the Original.  From a young naive but playful kid, to a dark, layered, mature adult.  Doom 3 was kind of a perfect demonstration of how a kids game could become a game for adults.Which is why Doom 4 is such a strange beast.  It's almost cartoonish in how light and palatable it tries to be.  There are no scares, no horror, even the blood is minimal and dried up.  Even the battles are, whilst challenging, about as scary as children's Halloween costumes.  Doom 4 is in a way a return from the mature dark horror defining game of 2004, back to the young, full of energy, and immaturity of the 90s.  You have zero punishment for doing badly.  Checkpoints, the option of infinite ammo with certain upgrades, a refill to full armour and health at checkpoints in boss battles, and every monster looks like a Pixar designed character.  That's not to say the game isn't tough, some of the arenas are relentless, and the boss battles are punishing, even on lower difficulties, and borderline impossible on max difficulty.  But There's nothing scary about any of it, just difficult.That being said, it's a great freaking game.  It's fun, there's a million combinations of weapons and mods to use, and every circumstance suits a certain type of weapon, it recaptures the excitement that FPS had in the late 90s.  If anything it's more a Quake game than a Doom game, but it feels more like the Original Doom than Doom 3 did, which is a strange situation, because it almost feels like it invalidates the strides and maturity that Doom 3 brought us.  Unlike Doom 3, no one's going to recall scary moments, look into the shadows expecting something to pounce out at them in real life, or lose any sleep.  Doom 3 had a strong psychological element to it that resonated with the player.  Doom 4 is just a fun game that you play and then stop playing.  That's not to say that it's bad, but in a way to me it felt empty compared to the experience that Doom 3 left me with.I gave Doom an impressive 8/10, because it's a badass game, that rekindles some of the childhood excitement I had with early FPS games, that has been lost to points systems and pseudo realism, also I'm sure it's a blast on multiplayer, and I will more than likely replay it in Arcade mode.  But Doom 3 was an experience that played tricks on my mind at night, and disturbed my girlfriend as she watch me play it, and there's a big gap between a fun game that you enjoy playing, and a game that feels more than just a game, an experience that changes you.  So whilst I shall look forward to Doom 5, and shall replay Doom 4 and check it out on multiplayer, I will dream of a Doom 3 remaster or spiritual sequel in the future.\"

Doom 2016 does not care about the modern standarization of FPS's, there is no such thing as a regenerating health: if you want to recover HP, you need to find medipacks spread across the map, or man up and defeat your enemies for a health drop. Cornering away and shooting enemies from afar will not get you far in this game, specially on the later stages, where the amount of enemies on screen is RIDICULOUS, and not a single frame drop on my whole playthrough.Also, the chainsaw: an insta kill (on limited amounts, of course) to any enemy. When cut in half with the chainsaw, enemies drop ammunition, so your carnage of lead and bullets continues, this balance between insane amounts of action and shooting never stops, and even if you run out of ammo, with a simple cut of the chainsaw the action goes on, giving this shooter an unstopable pace, no moment feels dull or boring, its action from beggining to end, not even the story makes a halt to the fun experience: as it almost non existant: the plot may very well be resumed like this: the gates of hell are open, demons sprawl on mars, go ahead and kill them all. That's it: there's almost nothing to spoil, nothing to tell, and it feels so refreshing.I just cant stress enough how good and fun of a shoter Doom 2016 is, and if you're fan of the FPS genre, you  own yourself to play this.\"

So used to health regen that I forgot my 90s roots! Also, I kinda rushed from mission 1-5 at first and that made the game felt easy and pointless.My opinion and experience changed however when it slowly grew on me and I did a new playthrough, but this time paying close attention to everything the game has to offer.If u want the best Doom 2016 experience, TAKE YOUR TIME (ironically since it's so fast paced), and EXPLORE. The mission challenges, weapon upgrade challenges, rune upgrade challenges improves the gunplay to PERFECTION.Those optional mechanics made me feel the huge variety of gameplay and gunplay Doom has on offer, and it isnt just a game of point and shoot. The challenges made me vary my playstyle and using every single gun, not just shotgunning my way through. This resulted in the most fun i've had in an FPS since Destiny.Second thing I loved about Doom is the Secrets. I had fun hunting down every single mission collectible and secret locations. Its also rewarding as it gives u early access to powerful guns, much needed ammo/armor, extra lore, classic playable Doom maps and fun mini collectibles. Very satisfying and rewarding.Bosses are super cool, I had an amazing time beating them at ""Hurt Me Plenty"" difficulty. I cant imagine going thru all that in Ultimate nightmare.

This forced me to reload my game twice. Secondly, the game struggles in long play sessions.

The maps are too big for undirected modes such as team deathmatch. Objective-based only.- Far too limited weapon selection- Progression is limited to skins after the initial unlocks. There is little to keep working towards once you've unlokced the weapons and demons (which doesn't take long). Added the ability to unlock and mix and match secondary fires would've added a lot of longevity to the mode.Available on Amazon now for under $20, DOOM provides an amazing campaign and nearly endless content between creative Snapmap additions and a solid multiplayer experience.

But this game needs an honest user review from an unbiased gamer who loves games of all genres.The 2 mainI can understand how certain fans of a specific genre might give it a 10; if you were a huge fan of Limbo or of similarly beautiful art styles, you'll love this game just as much, and it is quite an immersive world through its beautiful animations and dark dreamlike atmosphere. But this game needs an honest user review from an unbiased gamer who loves games of all genres.The 2 main facets of Inside are the puzzles and the story. Firstly, the puzzle sections of the game were often repetitive without anything truly revolutionary (although with some original concepts) for a 2-D platform/puzzle game. They aren't incredibly difficult which some may not be very happy about, but for me that actually isn't a complaint because I'd rather let the game and my enjoyment flow as opposed to getting stuck in frustration on a quirky puzzle for an hour at a time. Thankfully, I only spent about 20 minutes on the most challenging puzzle, and rarely as much on any other one. But as I mentioned, they are repetitive, and on the rare occasion annoyingly so. I also do have to give the game credit on being playable for almost anyone, and the mechanics are very simple with just a jump button and an action button the entire way through, and they work extremely well and are very functional.That brings us to the story. Without giving anything away, I have to admit it really leaves me wanting for more (again, I won't say exactly in which way as to avoid giving any absolute impressions about it, because I do feel it is something that needs to be interpreted by each player individually). I'll just say that on top of it being short, you'll either absolutely love the story and it's ambiguous implications, or you'll be left scratching your head in the end. There is mystery involved...So overall, Inside is a very fresh addition to anyone's game library, and a fun evening spent puzzling away. But really, that's all it is- one evening of play and as far as I could tell, no variation or incentive to playing it more than a second time around (if even that). So to give it as high a score as I would to some of the true masterpieces of the gaming world would be a crime, in my opinion. A hearty score of 7 for the 5 or so hours of fine enjoyment I got out fit, as well as the beautiful art and atmosphere. But nowhere near a 10 like so many others are giving it without at least another 10 hours of puzzles and gameplay, and certainly an extension of the story.\"

It looks great and plays in almost the same way with one or two extra little features that set it apart all while also being a tad nicer to look at when compared to Limbo.You control a little boy through an environment moving along and solving a few puzzles here and there to allow you to continue on your quest ""to the right"". This journey is completed in a mostly dark environment that fills you with all sorts of questions as you progress: How did I get here? Where am I supposed to go and why am I supposed to get there? Why are those people and ""things"" chasing me? Am I meant to be ""absorbed"" or ""assimilated""? etc. Fret not my dear friend as almost none of these questions will be answered and that is probably this games biggest fault.In addition it's also quite an expensive experience (for what you get in my personal opinion) as in before you know it you'll have completed the game and you'll also most likely be left with more questions than answers. There are perhaps one or two puzzles that are decent enough for you to not instantly figure out however others will just ensure that you back track a bit to make sure you have all of the pieces. There is also a hidden set of most optional bits (I'm trying to not give away anything here) that will unlock a secret ""ending"".Overall it was a fun experience and I'm glad I got to enjoy it however I was also left slightly empty afterwards especially knowing that I'd have to wait a good few months to possibly a year or two to make it viable for a second play through. In the end I was just left wishing that I'd rather just ignored it until it had gotten cheaper as it just didn't feel as if I had gotten my values worth.Buy it if you really, really really loved Limbo and you want more of the same thing and don't mind the current asking price otherwise wishlist it and pick it up with a discount a while later on down the line. 7/10 hurt mostly by it's very short playtime, limited replay value (it really is going to be almost identical to your first play perhaps with one or two additional secrets discovered here and there) and finally leaving you with more questions than answers after completion.\"

It's use of sound is also perfect, with the ""less is more"" approach with great ambience. The character animations when moving and performing different actions for both the boy you play as and others you come across are painstakingly detailed with sometimes humorous result and sometimes scary.Gameplay-wise, the puzzles are fun and exciting but not too difficult to figure out. The controls are very easy to understand, only the left analog stick, X and A are used, this could've been on NES basically. you only ever move left and right, although it felt sometimes like I was supposed to walk into the background by pressing up on the stick because the backgrounds are so vividly created and are always full of things happening. I never felt cheated because of bad character control, all the deaths I had felt like it was my own fault.The game is short. I finished it in 2-4 hours. It has a great flow to it. You get hooked and can't stop until you finish it. It might not be worth the current xbox live pricetag but it's video game art at it's best. It will take you on an emotional ride, you will laugh, get scared and surprised during this short but involving adventure.\"

2016,INSIDE,"Video games as an art form has been something heavily debated for some time, but if Playdead has any say on the matter I believe the case has been settled. Using their beautifully crafted game Limbo as a springboard, they created a masterpiece that surpassed its predecessor in every way. A puzzle game at heart, Inside is packaged in a game that is filled with emotion and wrapped in mystique."

The physics are so well done that they almost make the game feel easy, that is to say, you feel like a part of the game and that every movement is smooth and uninterrupted. The game is constructed in such a way that it sucks you in, and leaves no hints that you are actually playing a $20 platformer that you bought on whim. The farther you progress in the game, the more you question life and its importance when their are games like this to be played. Okay, perhaps I'm being a bit dramatic, but seriously, INSIDE is the type of game that leaves you with more questions than answers which is something unique nowadays.I have never played a game this smooth and peaceful, yet intense and engaging at the same time. Everything about this game gives you chills because of how it plays on some of our most primal fears and curiosity with the grotesque. I would say this has the best art and design of any game I have ever played. I would even argue its better than the first Bioshock game in terms of graphical design. INSIDE is one of the few games these days that actually makes you feel something inside while you play it; it even rivals 2001: A Space Odyssey in its incredible ability to make you question what is possible to make one feel in a videogame. It's about as far as you can get from the mindlessness of most games (If you think Call of Duty is the supreme videogame experience, then don't bother playing this game). The story of INSIDE is there, but it is never spoon fed to you through cheap tactics like dialogue. Instead, it is experienced through puzzles, brief animation, and attention to the environment.Every aspect of this game that can be measured is perfect, that's how good it is. This game is certainly short, but its oh so sweet.\"

This is NOT a long game. My first play through took three and a half hours and by my second play through I had found all of the optional secrets. So that's a total of approximately seven hours total for full completion, and half of that was retreading old ground. That is just NOT a value package considering the price at launch of sixteen English pounds.I look at Inside as an experiment in interactive storytelling rather than a ""gamers"" game. It is a wonderful experience, it just left me wanting more of it for the price I've payed.

A brand new master stroke from Playdead.With beautiful references to Limbo deftly disseminated here and there throughout this unique dark journey, a game concept transcended by its intelligent structure, an execution with great delicacy, a progressive breathtaking rhythm without any time out and above all, its deadly and remorseless traps.Inside keeps the player on tenterhooks by insinuating within his head, a profound feeling of unease while facing some passages, thus strongly rooting this dread of the failure that will lead the guy to his death. Not devoid of subtle cinematographical references, the game features a redoubtable graphical ambience that grabs the player by the throat and throws him at the heart of a very dark trek in a world that tremendously looks like a dystopia. Adding some tints of colour doesn't change the overall meaning of the artistic direction which takes root with fervor in that of Limbo, and hence brings the same amount of oppression. Managing to tell a story just through the use of a specific ambience, the environment, the Gameplay and subtle references, we can easily spot this indisputable know-how from Playdead who deals another coup de grÃ¢ce and makes an eloquent demonstration of one of their most primary talents.Masterful.\"

Although I agree it may confuse some player who lacks imagination and creativity.It hardly is a genre-defying game, but in a time where game companies just recreate the same format action/shooter/etc fast pacing games, yet without patient to build on a world full with intriguing details and element and paint a fascinating story, this masterpiece not only stand out, and fully deserve all the praises and acclaims\"

2016,INSIDE,"No story. No idea what is going on throughout the game, other than mind control... Both endings are stupid. Game is crazy short, then the ending starts to get exciting, picking up the pace then all of a sudden it feels like getting blu-balls. Credits roll then a overwhelming feeling of being kicked in the nuts for spending $20 on ... this. Wait till it drops in price for $5.00 on xbox live gold."

I echo her sentiment.  I purchased it on editorial reviews as I did Gone Home a few years back and it isn't often I think the consensus is so far off base but like Gone Home, for the record a WORSE game, I do not get the scores at all.  Pretty, cool animations, easy 'puzzles' and what story... not a good one.\"
2016,INSIDE,"Does anyone notice how terrible the ending is?The entire game was beautiful and was building up to something. An excellent story was brewing up.During the time I experienced the game, there was an exciting build up with tons of emotions going through me. It was glorious. Then the ending came. You get sucked into this glowing hole and the tension was real until you come into this chamber in a very, very anti-climactic and unsatisfying way and then you absorb yourself into this ball of people and escape the complex. Ultimate retard ending.I was absolutely livid. I felt played and trolled by Play Dead for ruining something that could have been ground-breaking. They had to make it disappointing on purpose or I really don't know what to think.\"
2016,INSIDE,Astonishing. I always wondered why the game took so long to produce. Now i know. Hollywood level production values. The cutting edge at your fingertips. Game of the decade. Best experience since Shadow of the Colossus. Well done Playdead.
2016,INSIDE,"this is a very fascinating and profound experience. Inside delivers on everything it sets out to be, its visually stunning with a very unique visual style, and the gameplay also has its own unique feel to it.

Its that kind of story that paints a big enough picture to get some idea of whats going on but leaves lots of areas for you to fill in yourself and make your own interpretation of this very ambitious story, themes and ideas. Not everyone is going to enjoy this game, because to fully appreciate it you have to really read into it, but even for those not willing to, the puzzles in the game should keep most people entertained. the puzzles are very well thought out and just as unique as everything else, unfortuently I do wish some of the puzzles could have been more challenging, but that's more a nitpick than anything. the only real issue I have with the game is that it can be a little overly obtuse, which for some may be a good thing allowing more discussions for theories, but it leaves feeling more confused then enlightened once you finish the game. I love that it leaves a lot to interpretation but it feels that it leaves to much of the picture blank and by the end of the game your not really sure what your looking at. But after reading some theories and some analyzing of your own, it may become a bit clearer, but I really do feel the game would be better if it was a little bit more concrete and is what is keeping it from being a 10. the gameplay can make you feel a little gloomy, but I feel the developers were trying to evoke those kind of emotions from the player, even if it made the game a little bit less enjoyable, which I really appreciate them doing, sacrificing what people may want for the sake of art is something developers are too scared to do now a days and its great to see small indie games taking those sorts of risks. definitely something you should try if you are into artistic games, you may end up loving it.\"

Played the whole thing in one night because it easily pulls you in and grabs your curiosity ""what is this world I'm exploring? What happened to society?"" This game is another step forward for video games as a creative story telling thought provoking amazing piece of entertainment device!"

2016,INSIDE,"There are no flaws, perfect throughout.It's so tight, there is no filler, no crap, it's so perfectly crafted and I cannot pick a single flaw in it.."
2016,INSIDE,"For me INSIDE is a mindblowing mindxxxing experience of high-tension WTF moments in a wonderfully melancholic atmosphere, a flawlessly crafted piece of art.Thank you, everyone at Playdead! Somehow playing your games makes me feel understood."
2016,INSIDE,"Atmospheric and intriguing. A story that keeps you guessing throughout. Puzzles with unexpected solutions and a morbid, dark feel that continues the tone set by Limbo. Although not the longest game this was worth every second of play. Even after finishing and finding every secret, like a good movie or book, Inside wouldn't let me forget about it."
2016,INSIDE,This is a very interesting project. The amount of care that went into this 2d platformer puzzler is pretty impressive. Worth a play if you enjoyed limbo.
2016,INSIDE,"This is the best game of its genre, hands down. It doesn't technically deserve a 10, but since it's at least a 9 and the best of its genre, in a genre that is lately overdone, it must have a bonus. Definitely recommended to anyone liking some atmospheric platformer."
2016,INSIDE,"LIMBO was a genre-defining effort that took the gaming world by storm, and I loved every moment of it. INSIDE had been teased for years so it began to build hype, which is potentially fatal to a game's reception. I was anxious as to how it could top the minimalist masterpiece that was LIMBO. It didn't equal LIMBO's greatness, but it somehow managed to accelerate onto a whole other level.LIMBO was a genre-defining effort that took the gaming world by storm, and I loved every moment of it.

It didn't equal LIMBO's greatness, but it somehow managed to accelerate onto a whole other level. This is what video games should be. The visuals are some of the best I've ever seen in a video game; despite the visuals being very minimalist and washed out like its predecessor, they are striking and beautiful, along with the glorious faux-3D level design. Its story unfolds slowly but at a perfect pace, sustaining a constant sense of intrigue and excitement. The game also evokes a surprising amount of emotion even though a word is never spoken and a facial expression is never seen. THAT is the sign of a good game; one which can make you feel something based solely on its level design and pace.The finale of the game was one of the biggest surprises and it hits all the marks in surrealism. The only disappointing aspect of the game was that the credits came too soon. This was so worth the six year wait and I'm thoroughly excited to see what Playdead think of next.\"

What's the scientists purpose?The game doesn't answer anything and leave everything to our own interpretation.I would enjoy it a bit more if i could get the plot properly, but gameplay wise it does very well. It's a 2D game that mixes platforming elements and stealth elements with heavy puzzle solving, which is fun and creative. There's some challenging ones, but their solution is never overly complicated or obtuse.I also enjoyed the horror movie atmosphere. Specially the start the reminds me a lot of the Friday the 13th movies. There's even some enemies wearing masks that look like Jason Voorhees. Although the abundance of gray looking scenarios was starting to annoying me.Anyway, it's a strange game, but it's worth the time spent and you will not really spend a lot of time here, since the it doesn't last more than 5 hours.\"
2016,INSIDE,"Inside is everything Limbo was and more. Whereas Limbo was a truly 2-dimensional platformer, Inside integrates the backdrop much more into the narrative of the game and provides visual cues that effect gameplay. The visual and audio elements of this game are like no other that I have played and left quite the impact on my imagination. So much so that I have no doubt that the imagery fromInside is everything Limbo was and more. Whereas Limbo was a truly 2-dimensional platformer, Inside integrates the backdrop much more into the narrative of the game and provides visual cues that effect gameplay. The visual and audio elements of this game are like no other that I have played and left quite the impact on my imagination. So much so that I have no doubt that the imagery from this game will stay with me subconsciously for the rest of my life. Anyone who has had dreams of video games you haven\t played in years will know what I am talking about. I personally played this game in a room with the door closed and the lights off and I was completely entranced during every second. When you can afford to, it is pleasant to just pause during certain portions of the game and take in the landscapes in the background and listen to the ambient noise of the environment.Like Limbo, the core gameplay of Inside is quite simple and this serves as a strength. The game is intuitive and easy to pick up. This simple gameplay removes superficial barriers and allows easy immersion into the game\s setting. Despite the simplicity of the core gameplay, the puzzles that you are tasked with completing are at the perfect level of challenge. They cause you to really think and observe your environment while not being so difficult that you spend an unnecessarily long amount of time trying to figure out what to do, all the while being drawn out of the immersive visual and auditory elements of the game. As the narrative progresses and you discover new and interesting aspects to this landscape\s environment, these aspects become integrated into the gameplay and puzzles. There is a real progression throughout the game of different environments and Playdead does an excellent job of integrating the evolving environment into an evolving gameplay. Playdead has also scattered various \collectible\ objects throughout the game. When all of these objects are deactivated the player has the chance to unlock a secret ending. I personally enjoy obtaining achievements, and every achievement in the game is related to the collectibles. I particularly liked how each achievement title/description gives you a hint as to the collectible\s location. On Xbox One there was also a picture of the collectible in its location for each achievement, but due to the way these are hidden away these pictures do not give away the collectible\s location. There\s also another visual tell that gives away that a collectible is nearby that I will not spoil. All in all, I really appreciated the way that the collectibles were done and I found them fun to collect. I personally don\t like when collectibles are obscurely hidden with no hints or clues as to their locations and Inside does just the opposite.Despite my praise for the immersive ambient environment above, Inside is filled with danger and the potential for brutal death much like its predecessor. By doing so, Inside manages to both capture your imagination and keep you on edge. This mixture creates a feeling that I think Limbo captured, and Inside did even better that in many ways is becoming Playdead\s signature.I\ll talk about the narrative and ending without providing any spoilers. The narrative in Inside is conveyed entirely visually. The game starts similarly to Limbo where the player simply appears from the left of the screen as an unnamed boy. You progress through increasingly industrial and urban areas and discover more and more mysteries that seem to have a scientific basis. The discovery at the end of the game (and the gameplay change that comes along with it) is quite shocking and interesting. After my initial playthrough, and seeing the original ending I found the ending to be pleasant albeit somewhat confusingly ambiguous. The alternate ending raised even more questions. For better or worse, this is the kind of ending that you Google after you complete the game. The answers I found on the internet seemed somewhat legitimate and the information I found completely challenged my first hypothesis about the meaning of the ending. I realized, like I think many other players have, that my first analysis was pretty superficial and that there are a lot of visual details shown throughout the entirety of the game that you realize in retrospect seem like parts of a larger picture. However, I don\t believe any conclusive evidence has been found or analysis done that gives a definitive meaning to the game. At first, I was displeased by this ambiguity. But I have found myself thinking quite a bit about the game and what meanings could lie within that I plan on playing through a second time and am eager to do so.\"

In this day and age there is a common misconception that if a game isn't 50+ hours long than it isn't a good game. Inside is the perfect example that you can make a game worth playing that is only a few hours long. Just because the game is short doesn't mean its not worth your time.The only reason why I gave it an 8 out of 10 was because I wasn't sure how I felt about the way the story ended. It was not the way I would have liked it to end, but you will just have to wait and see for yourself. The story overall left me with a lot to think about and I thought about the whole story for days after I had completed it.Other than my minor gripes with the ending, Inside is a great game and I would even go as far as to say it is a must play, if for nothing other than the fact that it is such a fundamentally sound and cleaver game.\"

No anoying foreced ingame cutscenes so far.Enemy Titan AI is very cool. They even talk to you via intercom and taunt you.For the Multiplayer i can just say ""wow"". It's fast and smooth. The Game-modes are unique in my oppinion and the fact that you don't have a pay-2-win aspect or even dlc (EA said so) is awesome.I think the game is what CoD could have been but failed. if you like sci-fi shooter with mechs: try it.Origin refund is always an option.\"

What we have here is an offering that so far exceeds the original concept in every category that it impresses me in spite of my high expectations for it.The single player is one of the most masterfully paced experiences I've played since the early Modern Warfare Games. The multiplayer now features a permanent unlock system and does away with the burn card system all together. Progression feels satisfying and is always giving you new toys to play with as you work towards unlocking the next new toy. The abilities significantly, and smartly, change the way you play the game and result in emergent play styles that are fun and satisfying in their own ways.The presentation is polished to a satisfying degree resulting in a fairly constant, high frame rate throughout the game. The movement system, while impressively complex, is so well designed and executed that using it is intuitive and easy to understand. It's a point that easy to overlook until you look at other games that attempt to allow you to do half of what Titanfall 2 does with much less success.Combat is blindingly fast and satisfying from the moment you jump onto the battlefield till the moment you almost make it into the evac ship.My only criticism I have is that one can occasionally find themselves wandering in a barren battlefield due to running in the wrong direction after spawning. This issue will likely diminish as the prevalence of map knowledge increases over time but it can still creep up while many of us are still getting our bearings.Overall, Titanfall 2 is a game that impresses me directly in the wake up Battlefield 1 which also impressed me in a big way. It's the Titanfall title that finally does the series justice. I eagerly await to see what new content is coming in future DLC and, eventually, in the inevitable sequel.\"

The movement is hard to describe....somehow it just feels right.  The titan brawls are absolute gorgeous mayhem.  I confess, I rarely know what I'm doing during these bashes, but just being part of the mix with the occasional titan kill is exhilarating.  The game modes are all fun, but  Bounty Hunt is my absolute favorite.  There are so many dynamic elements which interact with one another without being messy or confusing....it adds an element of dynamism the amplifies the excitement even more.

2016,Titanfall 2,"It's very different from the first game mainly cuz it actually has a campaign in it and it's not just multiplayer only.But I did enjoy the campaign as it was more focused on the relationship between pilot and Titan which I felt was really needed. How Cooper and BT was working together through this whole game was inspiring. Course some levels seem predictable and very cliched then again there was some parts that kept me guessing. I really like the level where you kept going through Rifts in time. I have a really fun switching back and forth. Like past time control games really need something like that. Also, it did a better job of telling the story than the first game did. Of course that would have been hard seeing that it was just being played in the background while you were in the middle of the multiplayer.Speaking of the multiplayer, I was having trouble with it at first but I think it's because I've been playing a lot of OverWatch and and not enough Call of Duty lately. I need to get back into the element of the modern shooter. And sometimes it's good and sometimes it's frustrating being killed out of nowhere. It was just too used to the run-and-gun type style of playing when I'm more of a stay and defend type guy.All in all, I enjoy playing this and would recommend it to anyone who like Shooters as well as giant robots.\"

Gotta love that.All in all this is by far one of the best games I have ever played - period.

The game shows off anew style of game with the involvement of mech's known as Titans. The first Titanfall was praised of being something fresh and new with the other shooters being more grounded and predictable in its gameplay. The problem with the first Titanfall was that it only featured Multiplayer with very few content that wasn't enough to make it 60 dollars worth and with the lifespan of only lasting a few months, it was very surprising to see that the game got a sequel. So does it measure up to even better than its predecessor or does it fall flat under with the other grounded shooters?Developers Respawn Entertainment as gotten a lot of backlash with the consumers about not having enough in the first Titanfall and one of them was that the game lacked a campaign mode. They have now addressed that and have added a campaign in Titanfall 2. From what I have played, the campaign is very good if not being very cliche on its story. I played as a Pilot name Jack Cooper whose job is to stop an evil cooperation from developing a weapon that can destroy planets. It sounds really basic with the good vs evil kind of thing, but what makes the campaign story fun to play through was the companion I got at the beginning. The companion was named BT-7274 or BT for short. He is a Titan that is linked to Jack  Cooper in which gave a battle advantage in a lot of scenarios. Throughout the campaign, the relationship between BT and Jack was written out well with given dialogue between the two and funny skits that was amusing which gave character to mechanical titan as he gives unusual literally responses that doesn't help the given situation or him trying to give Jack a thumbs up.Given that, the gameplay of the game is astonishing. The game is a shooter but the spin of the whole game is that the player is given to free maneuver around. To jumping over 40 ft in the air from running on walls as the player is shooting at Titans or pilots, the game is endless on its scenarios. From my playthrough, I was able to use a variety of weapons from Sub-machine guns to Auto-Pistols with the given setting of the world as each gun sound is impacting and astounding to listen to. The sound of the game is very well done as Titans clash against each other with the metals grazing or when a Titan punches on a Pilot, the pilot just burst into red mist.The only problem I had with the game was that even though the campaign was really refreshing to play, the story was too predictable and tameness as nothing in the story was climatic, given the amazing set pieces of the game. The villain's in the weren't fleshed out as well with one popping up after another. I don't really even know their end game since the ones I fought were mercenaries for hire. I wished the story was given more thought and the world was told better to help the player be more involved in the world.The game has a few flaws that would've made it even better but I am very happy of what I got. Titanfall 2 is an outstanding game with newly fresh gameplay and beautiful scenery. I say that it is a buy for anyone who wants a shooter or something different from the usual modern warfare.\"

It\s cool but not that great.Let me point out the main problems in this game for me:1. Wall-running and jumping is unpredictable. You\ll die many times because the system is unpredictable. The good thing here is that after every \parkour death\ you will restart quickly just were you died2. Guns are so confusing. This is a Call of Duty problem because it doesn\t work in the sci-fi setting. While we love to have the real names of all guns and many of us know the brands and models from movies or thug\s life (wink), it is pointless to name the fake guns using codes and numbers (for example something like RC270) in a game that has so many weapons. Easy solution? Less weapons that are almost the same and more characteristic names (funnily enough some of those weapons do just that, like the Mastiff-something riffle).3. The levels are boring in my opinion, and the shooting scenarios are chaotic and easily forgettable.4. Titans are no mechs. They\re more like exosuits. I love mech games and this does not feel right. It\s cool, but it lacks the feeling of being in a powerful machine with amazing defense and slightly less mobility. The CoD Killstreak rewards seem much more powerful to me.Now the good things about this game:1. It\s solid. The framerate seems perfect, visuals are never below technically great (even if on the boring side most of the campaign). When it works it can be spectacular.2. Titan entering animation is fantastic.3. Some story elements are interesting but they are very rare (like the time travel mechanic).4. Gameplay is just like any other Call of Duty game so if you like that, it\s great for you.5. Story is a bit less stupid than usually but the storytelling itself is **** It goes like this: \Go here. Oh! We barely made it! Yaaaay!!! Now let\s do this again and again and, OH! Wait! Let\s do another poorly disguised fetch quest cause we\re here anyway.  OK guys,  this is really the last one, you guys! HA! just kidding. OK now we\re really done. You did it! Great job\.Disclaimer:1. Any game that has a single player campaign can be judged by it. 70 Euros is a lot of money so I feel entitled to feel disappointment when what I receive isn\t exceptional. Excuses like \oh it\s a multiplayer game\ are the reason we are getting ****ty campaigns like this one (or worse) so often these days.2. The review is not very in-depth, because I don\t like this game enough to waste more time on it.\"

In that case, bore off to BF1 and COD:IW.I was unfortunate to not to play Titanfall 1 to see how much progress has been made, being a PS4 only owner. However, from my understanding the multiplayer was great but had a short lifespan due to basic progression and not a lot of variety in load outs.Well it is safe to say, these criticisms have been squashed with the huge variety and depth in the progression model this time round.Such a shame the release date was when it was. As two absolute juggernauts of gaming franchises (in regards to commercial success) probably mean this won't be appreciated by as many as it should.Only criticism is I think it is begging for Competitive / E-Sports mode, I hope this is planned some day.Easily the best FPS this window, and probably of the year.The real pioneers of Modern Warfare shine brightest.\"

With that said, titanfall 2 delivered on every mark it missed in the first game. The gameplay is somehow better and more fluid. The multiplayer subtleness and nuances are spot on. The single player is actually really good and flows well with the game. Its just fun, and after all that is what games are supposed to be.

A little background on me: I am a huge FPS fan, and have put hundreds of hours into games like Call of Duty, Battlefield, CSGO, and many more. I did not like the first Titanfall, and My expectations were low with this game, especially for the single-player.This game blows anything from the past while straight out of the water. The campaign is fun as hell and trying not to spoil anything, BT can be very comical in his perception of the world around him. Multi-player is fresh and new; something that Call of Duty has tried to do for the past three years, and failed. They definitely listened to the criticisms of the first game, of which the were many. The main GM is Attrition, basically TDM. It's fast paced, balls to the walls action. to quotes Rags, ""A still pilot is often a dead pilot, and that's something I enjoy. It can be a little overwhelming, but these complaints pale in comparison to the positives.This game has been completely underappreciated by a market of FPS fans who claim to want innovation and fresh game play, but continue to buy Call of Duty every year. This game was screwed over by EA and it really should have came out in early 2017, when people are looking for a new shooter to blow off the steam of Call of Duty and Battlefield.My complaints are minor, and most of them are my fault or can be solved by me. First the game will not start on true dual core CPUs. I had to install a separate program to fix this. I know the minimum specs recommend a quad core, but my Pentium G3258 is handling the game just fine, usually between 60-80 FPS in multi-player. This game literally runs better than CSGO on my computer. Second, I am getting a weird crunching sound out of my microphones which makes the game impossible to hear and unplayable if your trying to listen, this doesn't affect me too much as I usually listen to podcasts while playing games. Lastly, I don't know what is causing this but, every other game or so in the lobby I am kicked from multi-player and sent back to the main menu. It's no big deal as all I have to do is rejoin multi-player, which is surprisingly quick.Overall a bad-ass game, and totally worth your time and money.\"

Unfortunately, the main character is completely forgettable and generic and while I appreciate the mech having a voice and offering some banter, he just doesn't sell me his entire idea. He's no DOG from HL2, but to be fair he can be a battle station for you to pilot. The bosses are just different types of Titans that serve as tutorials for the multiplayer and I'm not convinced they are clever or interesting. The world building is good and all, but where is the Ravenholms? Where is the long runs down empty highways and tunnels that offer more than just (admittedly) fun platforming that gauges exploration and rewards the player? I see alot of potential in Titanfall 2's story, but it needs more to make a stronger statement to me.The multiplayer is equally good but troubling. The good parts is the combat and fluidity of movement is really awesome, allowing you to take down pilot and titan alike in a range of versatility. The inclusion of free dlc and class setup is a nice touch, but my problems lie also in the fact the game modes are lacking and because of the way the game was sold at launch, the servers are essentially dead and laid bare. Finding a game is difficult and I feel that it doesn't deserve this because it is a good game that deserves better.\"

Some things are different that may make some people feel it wasn't broke so why fix it - but in terms of keeping me excited to be playing for the long haul, I think Respawn nailed it!I found the original Titans to be so modular I quickly settled on a ""best loadout"" for me, Strider with 40mm burst fire, cluster bombs, and particle shield wall. No matter the map this never changed, the other Titan options were wasted on me. With TF2 each Titan seems to have a roll, so I pick my Titan based on map and enemy Titan types. I default to Tone most often I find, likely due to its similarity to my original, but I almost just as often switch things around depending on the match.The pilots are nicely varied. I find the grapple and phase powers to both be very rewarding to the imaginative pilot, and feel none of the powers are throw away. For guns, I can find at least one in each class I feel intuitive with, and while I'm not a big CoD player I feel the weapon selection is ample (but if you do play BF or CoD you might disagree).My problems with the game steer more to the game types. Attrition appears to be the only mode I can consistently have fun with. Mixing with Adds while hunting pilots and facing off against Titans is a blast. The different Specters and larger Reapers are a great addition. Most other modes don't offer enough Titan time - they end up being just pilots vs pilots for most of the match. And Last Titan Standing, I went in with a team of 4 friends but somehow we can't win a single game. Legions appear to be biased for this game type. However these are the kinds of things I can see Respawn fixing after some feedback and balancing so it's a minor concern for the short term.Originally I hated the lack of shields and the addition of batteries in the tech test. It didn't make sense and my Titans would die really quick. But with the full game I find there is a very enjoyable ballet between engaging or surviving, coordinating with other Titans or attacking solo. Playing with a friend often times means teaming up, one in Titan, the other harassing enemy Titans, stealing batteries, and keeping my partner at peak efficiency. It is a much more complicated play style that I expect will keep me from getting board of the more basic strategy of the original for much longer.  A few times I try to maximize Titan longevity at the cost of points and find it easy possible to spend the entire match in a single Titan.  Sure you won't be on the front lines racking up all the kills but give me a Tone and a map that isn't valley warfare and I can stay pretty safe if that's what I want to do.I really hope more people pick up a copy by Christmas. It's a really great game that I think will only get better from a larger pool of pilots. And all future maps and DLC included? $60 was a very simple decision for me to make. No regrets!\"

It's too bad that BF1 and Infinite Warfare will sell many more copies because of their lineage/name instead of quality. That's not to say BF1 is bad. It's a good game too, but TF2 is much more fun. The main problems with TF2 are 1. It was released right between BF1 and Infinite Warfare. Whoever made that decision should be fired. 2. The playerbase will be a potential problem down the line. More players are really the only obstacle between this gaming being excellent and being a classic FPS.\"

2016,Titanfall 2,"This is hands down the best first person shooter for PS4.

The game has been compared to COD but I think that's a mistake, it really feels and plays nothing like it. To me it has more in common with Quake (super fast smooth arena shooter) with Titans adding the element of the old Armored Core games. Respawn may not have spent nearly as much as their competitors advertising this game, but rest assured that those saving were invested where it counts- in making the game. With the exception of MGSV (huge Kojima fan here) this is in my view the best game for the PS4. Buy it.\"

I've read some of the negative user reviews, and from what I can see those people only put in the minimum amount time possible (Or have not even played the game).

The only problem is it's not easy to do, especially when you're in the middle of full-scale interplanetary war.  Nonetheless, you get your chance, albeit rather quickly which is kind of a shame .. they could have played out the training/desire factor a bit more, but still tons of fun nonetheless.  Throughout the campaign you learn how to become a tier 1 pilot, picking up new and interesting titan loadouts along the way (weapons packages that give you different advantages against bosses).  Oh yea, there's bosses.  As an older gamer, I miss bosses being the checkpoint between levels.  This game's got them and they're definitely challenging.  The campaign is about 6 hours of play (didn't time it so forgive me) but by the end you start to love your titan and you save each other form crazy situations.  The final scene is one of hope that sets up a likely sequel (YES!). They did an amazing job of playing with emotions and weaving a great story amongst a chaotic universe.Multiplayer is just tons of fun.  There were critics saying you didn't get Titans quick enough during the tech test ... well you get them plenty fast now, so don't listen to that nonsense.  Leveling is no quick feat, so prepare to spend some serious time just getting the next best gun.  Customization is on point, tons of different ways to play  The addition of the pilot tactical (like grapple or sonar knife) make the game tons of fun to play.  You can really move around the map just like in the first one, except now you're doing it FASTER.Get this game ... you really won't regret it.\"

The multiplayer is tons of fun, and as you become more familiar with the maps you get a sense of the wallrunning and mobility lanes that you can use to creatively come at your opponents from unpredictable angles.The gunplay feels solid, the class based Titans give interesting choices and create dynamic fights between titan classes as they have strengths you want to avoid and weaknesses you want to exploit, for example Tone is great against Ronin at range because of it's 40mm autocannon and rocket salvos, and Ronins weapons and core ability are all short-medium range, if the Tone pilot allows Ronin to close the gap, Ronin can output a ton of damage in a short amount of time.The sendoff of burn cards in favor of boosts is a welcome change, although some boosts seem very strong and some boosts seem very weak.  I can see boosts as being a thing that are banned from competitive play because essentially when every player is taking the same boost, it would be the same as no players having boosts, but with more ""unfun"" moments when a titan instakills you with SMGs using amped weapons.Overall, Titanfall 2 is a complete package, all DLC, maps and weapons are coming free, the single player, while short, is meaningful and has fun sequences as you and BT fight against all odds.  The multiplayer is a blast, and feels like a mixture of Tribes and Mechassault, it's both fast and the gunplay feels tight.\"
2016,Titanfall 2,"A hidden gem ! Multiplayer is pure fun and you can tell where all the talent from Infinity Ward went, it mops the floor with all the Call of Duty titles from the past 6 years ! Campaign is okay but I recommend playing it on highest difficulty if you wan't some challenge, otherwise it might feel a little short . Can't wait to see what free dlc will be provided post launch."
2016,Titanfall 2,"I think this is the best fast paced FPS online game since modern warfare,it just feels great and hard to put down,kinda like the movie transformer,a new king in sci-fi shooter genre."
2016,Titanfall 2,I can't praise this game highly enough... It's the most fun I've had playing a FPS for years. The campaign is superb (albeit quite short ) and the multiplayer is excellent.If you only buy 2 multiplayer shooters this year it should be this and Battlefield 1... and if your looking for a single player shooter.. Buy doom.

The movement, speed, and gun fights remind me a little bit of Quake 3 Arena - which was absolutely frantic and tons of fun (from my PC gaming days and the old mouse and keyboard combo).If you're still wondering which game to pick up, this'll hit the right spot if you're looking for something fast paced and fun.

Not sure why they couldn't have that ready for day one, but I'll let it slide...especially since the DLC is free.

BO3 feels clunky in comparison. On top of choosing a number from 1 to 8 for your sensitivity, there are several different response curves you can choose from to tailor your aim and turning abilities.Overall it's a solid game and is super fun to play.

And yet, this game blew my expectations out of the water. From a technical standpoint, this game is a modern marvel. The graphics are amazing and almost lifelike.

I had very high expectations for this game, considering that I've been a big fan of each game on the PS3, and heck, even the game on the PSVITA. And yet, this game blew my expectations out of the water. From a technical standpoint, this game is a modern marvel. The graphics are amazing and almost lifelike. Things like hair, foliage, lighting, shadows, and even more and done extremely well. This game is the embodiment of the term ""next-gen"" and it is, without a doubt, the best looking game on this console generation. The gameplay is everything that you would expect from an Uncharted game, plus more! Now, a lot of people are complaining about how the game is just like any of it's predecessor's gameplay wise, and honestly, it is, but that's not a bad thing. This game is Uncharted, it's not some new IP, and so of course it's going to be like the older games, but there's so much more new stuff added to keep it refreshing. Things such as the hook mechanic, the sliding mechanic, the new stealth system, and more. The AI is also better than ever. In older Uncharted games, when you got spotted, the AI wouldn't stop unless you were dead or they were dead. Once they saw you, they basically fixated on you, even if you were out of their sight. In this game, the AI is much different than that. There's three different ""modes"" of the AI: passive, neutral, and aggressive. Passive shows up above an enemy when you're out in the open and there's a great chance of them spotting you. Neutral is when they think they've spotted you, but you've obstructed their visual with you and then they go and investigate. And aggressive is when they start shooting at you after spotting you. This adds a much more realistic taste to the game that is done very well. The shooting is as fun as ever as well. They've also added another new mechanic...vehicles. Now, in the game, you can drive cars and boats, which, while it may not seem groundbreaking, is just a nice touch. The game also borrowed a bunch of things from The Last of Us, a game also developed by Naughty Dog in 2013. Things such as the side conversations, and the new hidden things such as documents that you can discover, look at and read. Again, while it may not seem groundbreaking, it's a nice touch. Another cool thing is that, when Nate, Sam, and Sully are having a conversation, if you do anything to stop the conversation (i.e. driving through a waterfall or a shootout) they'll say something like, ""wait, what were we talking about"" and they'll just pick up the conversation from there. It's that realistic, and the detail is perfect. And the story, oh, the story. It's marvelous! The end of Uncharted 3 kind of left you for a yearning to find out what happened after the seemingly abrupt ending. Well, I don't want to spoil anything, but let's just say, it's great to find out what happened, and the story is anything that you would expect from Uncharted, but even better. It's so much more fleshed out. Anyways, whether you're a big fan of the series, whether this is your first game, or whether you don't even have a PS4, you NEED to pick up this game. The $60 price tag is way worth it in the long run (though, I would recommend playing the first 3 games just so you know most of the characters and what's going on). It's that good. I'm about halfway through the game and I'm loving it. I haven't played much multiplayer (though I did participate in the open-beta) and let's just say that it's not tacked on and is very much fun... : )\"

2016,Uncharted 4,"Personally this game for me so far (11 chapters in) is playing like a 9.5/10. However the fact that it currently sits at a user score of 7.8 (salty xbox fanboys probably) is an absolute insult to one of the best game developers that has ever existed and the people marking it down because of pure jealousy should be ashamed.

I am therefore marking it as a 10 to bring the score back up as it rightly deserves.The graphics are the most beautiful I have ever seen on a console. There were times playing the game when it would be showing a cutscene and my character would be standing still because I didn't even realise I was back in control as I hadn't realised the cutscene had ended.The gameplay is fluid and in some areas I can imagine you could get through without needing to fire a single bullet, the stealth system has improved that much. For years developers have been trying to design characters that can actually swim underwater and have the gameplay not feel like absolutel trash, they have failed every time. Naughty Dog comes along in their first attempt at an underwater level and absolutely perfects it. They also perfected driving sequences.The story is engrossing, the multiplayer is fun, I am struggling to find any negatives about this game.\"

2016,Uncharted 4,I think that the PS One scene and Drake remembering his past (Memories form Uncharted games) are the best easter eggs ever!. Madgascar is amazing and multiplayer is very fun. 10/10\

And felt it sud be defined as a ""Painting in Motion""...I'm not doing any review fr this masterpiece, rather sharing my POV about it..First of all I felt the long wait for Uncharted 4 was of worth as Naughty Dog didnot rush and made any compromise at all with the last installment in d UC series...Superb visuals with occasional framerate drop issues (I didn't download the day 1's 5GB patch as I lacked patience), an eye fr minute details, seamless integration from cutscene to gameplay, picturesque locations n places with interactive features with the player were the real pleasure for eyes... also the art of storytelling thru a vdo game got redefined. Compared to the previous UC installments, it has got way better enemy AI, and in many a cases bunch of enemies outnumbering the player, though aerial knockouts were bit of a challenge to me (it was really disappointing at times) in the game as it was showcased in the gameplay reveals, drivable cars with its natural interaction with muddy and rock solid surfaces, hardcore action sequences (both hand to hand and shooting), great amount of stealth, multiple paths to reach or execute the opponents, trickier puzzles (some were really nightmares), also the map wider than the semi open world maps...characters (known and newly introduced) are nicely knitted, revealing their hidden secrets, humane sides and twisted edges along with the pace of the story...3 yrs ago wen TLOU came from the same dev house, we were mesmerized n became speechless... Now I can vouch that UC4 in addition to that will hypnotize u all as well...Won't say much now...enjoy this masterpiece asap, which pushed the PS4 boundaries to the optimum level and delivered the wildest and wonderful dreams in a small round shaped blue ray disc..And for Naughty Gods...Thnks for making UC4 nd introducing it to mankind...plss take max time for TLOU 2 and make us awestruck with ur creations in future again n again..\"

The game play is, to put it simply, fun. From shooting enemies with a range of different weapons to swinging from ledge to ledge with a rope, the game is never a bore. Naughty Dog has also in it's latest release shown us just what the console are capable of and has raised the bar for future video games to come.

InsommaIndubbiamente il miglior capitolo della serie, indubbiamente un gioco capace di emozionare con una grande trama e con personaggi capaci di coinvolgere, una regia ed una narrazione straordinaria, un capolavoro tecnico, sotto ogni punto di vista, un gameplay ulteriormente rifinito sia in fase esplorativa che nelle sezioni da tps, che farebbero impallidire un qualsiasi Gears Of War! Insomma per farla breve Naughty dog c' Ã¨ riuscita ancora, ha creato un capolavoro, una perla videoludica che alza ulteriormente l' asticella degli standard nel mondo dei videogames! Siamo assolutamente, a livello qualitativo sugli standard di The Last Of Us, altro capolavoro che diventer , o che forse lo Ã¨ gi , senza tempo! Insomma, Naughty Dog did it again! Certo non Ã¨ perfetto, ma sono del parere che nessun videogioco lo sar  mai, fino in fondo, ma Ã¨ giusto premiare Uncharted 4 con un bel 10 in quanto, almeno a mio parere, c' Ã¨ un elevato coinvolgimento emotivo che a quanto pare di questi tempi sempre meno giochi sanno regalare! E' quello che aldil  della tecnica, aldil  della mera narrazione ed aldil  del mero gameplay che eleva un programma definito videogames ad ARTE videoludica! Grazie ancora una volta Cagnacci!\"

2016,Uncharted 4,"I haven't played through all the games yet, but for a couple of hours playing I already make sure that this could be the best Uncharted game ever made. This doesn't mean that all those cinematic cutscences and intensive action movie plots have certainly excelled the previous epsoides,which may be extremely hard to beat. I am talking about the impressive storytelling and beautiful pacing,I haven't played through all the games yet, but for a couple of hours playing I already make sure that this could be the best Uncharted game ever made. This doesn't mean that all those cinematic cutscences and intensive action movie plots have certainly excelled the previous epsoides,which may be extremely hard to beat. I am talking about the impressive storytelling and beautiful pacing, which holds your heart and always make you want to dig further to unveil the whole stroy,this is precious feeling I experienced only in a handful of video games like The last of us.The feeling of shooting is much better than before,weighted and balanced to a perect level, the explosive effect is unprecedented, and the new laso adds much fun to the platform jumping and climing part.This is certainly not a perfect game, at least not perfect for everyone, for you can be deeply attracted by the story and characters and couldn't  have enough of it, or just feel boring for too much talking and emotional expressions. If you just want to grab some big gun and kill your way out,this may not be the right game for you,but if you want to explore the intriguing life of a real treasure hunter, I cannot find anything parallel to this one. So it's a certain 10/10,for me.\"
2016,Uncharted 4,"A must have for ALL PS4 owners! The voice acting, lovable, memorable characters, great character development, gorgeous graphics you'll ever see in a video game without any MODS, tons and tons of little details you'll never find in any other games!"
2016,Uncharted 4,"Amazing game low scores of 1s and 0s are nothing more than PC fanboys and XBox fanboys. Go ton Amazon and you'll see some of the same copy & paste reviews, lol."

2016,Uncharted 4,"Amazing game so much attention to detail. Great gameplay. A lot of users are hating on this game for no apparent reason. People giving it a 0 and justify that by saying there are too many 10s are just asinine. If you give this game anything under a 9 your crazy or a complete troll. If this game were multiplatform it would be an easy 9 user score. Games deserve credit where credit is do, regardless of what platform they are on.\"
2016,Uncharted 4,"Holy **** This is the game that defines the next gen. The only way you can give this a low score is if you're a xbox fanboy.Graphics are the best on next gen so far.Story is great, you really feel for the characters as they go on a rememberable adventure.Overall this game is amazing but it does have minor flaws (which don't bother the (experience)10/10"

All I can say there are certainly now bad things in this game! I played through it Non stop, it doesn't get boring for a minute!It is really SAD to say goodbye to Nathan Drake after all, he is one of those characters who walks next to you through your life, but at some point has to say goodbye, and here is this moment... I will miss him, Sally and others a lot, feels like a lot is being taken away from my life.It was FANTASTIC 12 Hours of gameplay, they will never be forgotten by me and will always stay in my herat. Thanks a lot!\"

I think by the time i finish this game, it'll be the best i ever played. If you have a PS4, and you don't have this game already, you're missing out BIG TIMEE."

2016,Uncharted 4,"Simply put, the best game on PS4 and one of the best games I've ever played - period. Visually eye-boggling with crazy-refined mechanics, you actually feel like you're free climbing not just jumping around the side of a mountain cliff.

The gunplay, which is the bread and butter of the game, feels great. The guns have recoil and handle like a cannon, not a pea-shooter like in previous entries. You can definitely see the influence from The Last of Us in the gameplay and the grounded story.This is definitely the culmination of 10 years worth of work. You would be doing yourself a disservice if you own a PS4 and didn't at least try this game.Yes, I've always been a fan of the series and it's modern-day Indiana Jones vibe, but this is an outstanding game, Uncharted or not. I had high expectations for this game, but my expectations were blown out of the water nonetheless. I had a smile on my face from start to finish.\"

It even pips TLOU , which was my favourite game up until playing this. 10/10 , 100/100 , out of this world .\"
2016,Uncharted 4,"Great game, doesn't deserve the low rating from users. The parkour elements are superb as always, dialogue is excellent and hilarious at times and I'm really liking the story so far. The multiplayer is fun and plays a bit like The Last Of Us factions, only a lot more fast paced and less stealthy. I only wish you could create your own character in MP."

Naughty Dog has worked incredibly hard, this game reflects function and an ever powerful work ethic.  They have done so much to put this game in our hands, and I know the 0/10 scores do not refer to any true opinion of their art. Uncharted 4 achieves so much, it is a testament to the power of gaming, and to downplay the success of the studio does not assist your platform in any way, it holds it back. Do you think Microsoft or any other studio actually knows you exist? You could fall off a building and die and that doesn't change them in any way.  Do you think disrespecting the work of a unified studio will actually change your standing with these companies? WHAT DO YOU THINK CHANGES?!?!?!?! If you are happy with your platform, so be it, if you are truly dissatisfied in any way find a way to shape that platform to the communities image. Fight for good gaming! Angry Army FTW!!!\"
