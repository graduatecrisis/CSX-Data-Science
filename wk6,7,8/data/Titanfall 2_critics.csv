"PSNStores","100","The best way to describe the gameplay in Titanfall 2 is fluid and precise."
"Guardian","100","While its contemporaries focus on new ways with which to shock and excite on screen, Respawn makes the simple act of playing feel superlative. Its multiplayer is bigger and better, with the necessary depth and momentum to take it beyond these first few months after release, while its short but exciting single-player mode has the craft of some of the best campaigns of the last decade."
"Gaming Age","100","It’s a better, and fuller version of the original game to me, and ideally we’ll see developer Respawn get another chance to expand upon the series in the near future."
"GameSpew","100","By adding a truly surprising and impeccably designed single-player campaign that is consistently fun to play, as a package Titanfall 2 is the most pure, minute-to-minute fun I’ve had with any game this year."
"Giant Bomb","100","Titanfall 2 might not fix every issue you had with the previous game (and depending on your tastes, it might introduce one or two new ones), but it's a bigger, bolder game that takes a few chances and comes out better and more distinctive for it. On top of all that, it simply feels great."
"Cheat Code Central","96","Everything that makes a shooter fun - mobility, action, and a sense of empowerment - has been perfected here, and we're already waiting to see what Respawn does next."
"Playstation Universe","95","A frenetic, enthralling, and inventive shooter in both single and multiplayer, Titanfall 2 is a spectacular beast of a game that is deserving of a place among the greats of this generation."
"The Jimquisition","95","Titanfall 2 is everything Titanfall should have been – storified, robust, and sufficiently multiplatform. The real series starts here, and I’m surprised at how nothing at all feels phoned in or tacked-on."
"Game Informer","95","In an era where it feels like the majority of shooters either have single-player or multiplayer tacked on, Titanfall 2 is the full package. The top-tier campaign has nearly perfect pacing, and the subtle revisions and additions to the multiplayer make it better than ever. For first-person shooter fans, Titanfall 2 is a must play."
"God is a Geek","95","Titanfall stands out as an example of how there is still plenty of room for innovation and newness in a crowded genre space. It's superbly executed and incredibly fun to play."
"Impulsegamer","92","With a single player campaign that subverts expectations at every corner, a movement system that can only be described as heavenly and a robust selection of multiplayer modes with more free content to come in the future, Titanfall 2 is one of the year’s biggest surprises and is a must-buy for any serious shooter fan."
"Digital Chumps","92","Titanfall 2 is everything that Titanfall should have been. It contains a wonderfully endearing campaign mode that contains some unique and fun gameplay design, while satisfying the multiplayer experience with a bevy of modes and customization options. This certainly feels like a complete game."
"Playstation Official Magazine Australia","90","Far from the footnote it could have been, Titanfall 2 is a huge, headline shock. In a standout year for the shooter, this interstellar adventure dares to go big and beyond the familiar. What it finds out on the frontier is worth seeing. [January 2016, p74]"
"Edge Magazine","90","The core Titanfall moveset is a joy, and it has been thoughtfully expanded with a delightful grappling hook. [Jan 2017, p.112]"
"Games Master UK","90","Ace online action combines with a truly rollicking campaign in one of the year's shootiest surprises. [Christmas 2016, p.66]"
"Playstation Official Magazine UK","90","Respawn could have settled for big dumb fun, but Titanfall 2's eclectic, standout campaign and honed multiplayer make for a smart and unusual shooter. A total rush from beginning to end. [Christmas 2016, p.84]"
"Gaming Nexus","90","Titanfall 2 succeeds in being both accessible and fun, which is a nice change of pace in the modern era of shooters. It isn't the most complicated of shooters, nor is it the most refined. However, it very well may be the most fun, which is the most important thing to a gamer."
"DarkStation","90","Even if you never touch the multiplayer side of Titanfall 2, the game is worth the price of admission for its creative and continually engaging single player experience. Challenging, puzzling, surprising, funny, and above all, satisfying, the campaign elevates Titanfall 2 to one of the best shooters of the year. Pair that stellar accomplishment with an equally full-featured competitive suite, and the result is the definition of “must buy.”"
"PlayStation Country","90","Titanfall 2 improves on the original in almost every way, it takes the frantic action and amps it up even more in both the multiplayer and the brilliant new single player mode. Couple this with the consumer friendly DLC approach, excellent visuals and creativity and you have one fine game. Respawn have outdone themselves."
"Gamers' Temple","90","What Titanfall 2 boils down to is the kind of experience that you are looking for. I already had somewhat of a salty opinion from what I had seen of the first game although I also had no idea what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised and was blown away within the first hour of playing. Each day I went to work I couldn't wait to come home and play more."
"Toronto Sun","90","Titanfall 2 rises to the challenge of building something worthwhile on its predecessor’s foundation, and it’s fresh, fun and full of surprises. Happy endings aren’t always common in boy-and-his-’bot stories, but here’s hoping these mechanical marvels will stick around for a good, long time."
"Eurogamer Poland","90","Titanfall 2 is better than the first game in almost every aspect. Campaign connects us with the world, and multiplayer is improved thanks to more varied Titans and maps. Respect for Respawn: for listening to the consumers and providing almost a perfect sequel."
"Push Square","90","Titanfall 2 is what the first-person genre so desperately needed: an injection of originality. The divine single player campaign is something truly special, and we won't be forgetting any of its standout moments in a hurry. Couple this with a deep multiplayer serving that offers a variety of modes and unique gameplay mechanics and you've got one of the best FPS games of the generation so far."
"We Got This Covered","90","Titanfall 2 is easily some of the most fun you'll have this year, both online and off."
"VideoGamer","90","With its thrilling multiplayer now backed up by a surprisingly excellent single-player campaign, Titanfall 2 is every bit the sequel I'd been hoping for."
"CGMagazine","90","It’s not a perfect game by any definition, but what game is? It’s also not a game that will convert random people into first person shooter fans. What you will find in this game is a series of shooting and platforming set pieces that will make you think, “Wow! I just did that? I am awesome, all hail me!”"
"Critical Hit","90","Titanfall 2 is a far more “complete” package then that the first game was, offering one of the best single player campaigns in first person shooter, and a robust and cleverly nuanced multiplayer. It's everything the first game should have been."
"Attack of the Fanboy","90","Respawn Entertainment managed to take the foundation of the first Titanfall and craft a great campaign along with an improved multiplayer experience, making the sequel a fantastic game that any FPS fan should check out."
"IGN","90","It’s rare that a sequel evolves on every part of the original concept so consistently for the better, but Titanfall 2 is that exception. Its feelgood movement is the foundation for both the engaging action and platforming gameplay of its strong campaign and its over-the-top competitive multiplayer. With bolstered progression, customization, variety, and a fleshed-out story, Respawn has made good on its original vision with Titanfall 2. And bottom line, it’s just damn fun to play."
"EGM","90","Titanfall 2 is to be respected for accomplishing all its objectives. Quantity in games is nice, but Titanfall 2 proves that quality is often preferable."
"Metro GameCentral","90","One of the best first person shooters of the generation, with significant improvements in depth and longevity – and even a half decent story mode."
"Meristation","90","TITANFALL 2 improves most of the original game with great single player campaign, new titans, weapons and perks for it's frantic multiplayer that adds some interesting new modes. Fluid, speedy shooter (little less than first game) and more balanced experience."
"Areajugones","90","Titanfall 2 improves every multiplayer aspect of its previous installment and features a short but intense single player campaign. This game is a revolution in the first person shooter genre."
"Multiplayer.it","90","Titanfall 2 is undoubtedly a shining example of brilliant game design. The campaign is short, but it's also perfectly paced and full of surprising moments, while the multiplayer changes make the experience way more varied when you compare it to the predecessor."
"Digital Spy","90","This isn't just a worthy sequel to Titanfall, but one that improves upon the original while adding a superb single-player campaign. The latter combines fast-paced action, pilot acrobatics, heavyweight Titan warfare and a surprising amount of heart in one of the most enjoyable solo storylines of the year...It's a masterful piece of work."
"TheSixthAxis","90","On the one hand, you have a short, but fun single player that’s more free and open than most FPS campaign, and on the other, a multiplayer that’s an iterative improvement on an already fantastic game. In other words, Titanfall 2 is as exhilarating and refreshing now as the original was back in 2014."
"Hardcore Gamer","90","Titanfall 2 breathes new life into the concept and has solidified it as a franchise."
"GamesRadar+","90","Intelligent, creative, and never less than thrilling, Titanfall 2 finally realises the series' true potential with verve and polish."
"GameSpot","90","Titanfall 2 demonstrates a vitality that its predecessor couldn't. Whereas the first Titanfall kept up its breakneck pace throughout the entirety of every match, Titanfall 2 understands that sometimes, dialing things back for a few moments can make the long run much more enjoyable. In many ways, Titanfall 2 feels like the game Respawn should have made in 2013. It's a fantastic sequel. It's a fluid shooter. It's a spectacular game."
"PlayStation LifeStyle","90","Titanfall 2 is the new king of the FPS hill. Controls are tight, action is fierce, maps are intricately designed, and Titans are badass. The cherry on top is a campaign that is genuinely enjoyable, and one that fans of the first game are likely to be satisfied with, which expands upon the universe of the series. Group all of this together with an ambitious free DLC plan, and the choice of which shooter to buy this holiday season becomes obvious. Titanfall 2 is second to none."
"COGconnected","89","Respawn Entertainment did just that with Titanfall 2; they turned the ideas and mechanics from the first game into an even better experience."
"LaPS4","88","Titanfall 2 takes the first spot in the frantic, close-quarter scenario shooters. Respawn Entertainment has put a lot of effort in this game, clearly aiming to take the spot of the Call of Duty franchise, whose last entry will be on stores in a few days. An amazing campaign and an entertaining multiplayer."
"Everyeye.it","87","Titanfall 2 is an excellent shooter from many points of view. It offers a good amount of contents and a solid multiplayer. It is a direct evolution of what we saw in the first chapter, but with several improvements to make it even more attractive."
"GameCritics","85","Titanfall 2 is both a triumph and a mild disappointment, providing an exceptionally well-crafted singleplayer campaign alongside robust multiplayer that doesn’t quite hit the heights of its groundbreaking predecessor despite some great additions to the formula – the Legion Titan’s minigun is undoubtedly a thing of wonder. Despite my feeling that the multi has lost a few tricks, it remains pretty much best-in-class, and newcomers to the series will undoubtedly be blown away."
"PSX-Sense.nl","85","The story lacks depth, but the connection between the player and his Titan is worth the journey. The multiplayer, however, is almost worth the price tag on its own."
"ZTGD","85","Titanfall 2 is the product of a developer that took to heart all the criticism that was thrown at the original."
"Destructoid","85","There isn’t a shooter on the market that can compare with Titanfall 2 when it comes to imagination, inventiveness, and flat out spectacle."
"Worth Playing","85","All in all, Titanfall 2 is a well-made and enjoyable shooter that should be a good buy for any shooter fans. The main campaign is fun to play through, and it makes good use of gameplay mechanics. The multiplayer is fast, frantic and exciting, and it has enough variety that people will repeatedly come back to blast apart pilots and Titans. For PlayStation owners, this is the first chance to try out Titanfall's high-mobility gameplay, but even fans coming over from the Xbox One should enjoy the improvements."
"Post Arcade (National Post)","85","Titanfall 2 is likely pretty close to the game the original Titanfall would have been if we lived in a perfect world where deadlines did not exist and developers didn’t need to put a product on shelves in a timely fashion in order to stay in business and feed their families. It’s a complete package, it’s polished and pretty, and it’s super fun."
"SpazioGames","85","With Titanfall 2, Respawn is offering a fresh and new FPS, with a solid Campaign mode. Multiplayer is still very good but with some gameplay simplifications is not the total evolution we expected."
"JeuxActu","85","Titanfall 2 improves the breed mainly by adding a true solo campaign mode which was really lacking in the first game. The multiplayer doesn't evolve much, but overall the game offers strong content for gamers."
"Game World Navigator Magazine","82","First two hours of campaign are surprisingly boring, since beautiful Typhon nature quickly gets replaced with dull industrial zones. But when it looks like Respawn has once again screwed up singleplayer, Titanfall 2 suddenly picks up the pace and starts delivering one interesting setpiece after another.  [Issue#214, p.48]"
"NZGamer","82","Titanfall 2 is designed just well enough, and with enough layers so to not be entirely derivative. Hero simulations are so vastly abundant in this industry - so if you’re going to play one, you might as well choose from those who do it the best."
"GameOver.gr","80","The surprisingly good -albeit short- campaign along with a well balanced multiplayer mode offers a great game that should not be lost from your radar during this “FPS packed” season of the year."
"Slant Magazine","80","There's a few games that compete with Titanfall 2 as a vehicle for multiplayer chaos, but there's nothing out there like its single-player campaign."
"Telegraph","80","Titanfall 2 shines when it is, as Alavi says, doing things that other shooters do not. Whether it is in the surprising invention of its campaign, or the busy ebb and flow of its multiplayer modes, this is a shooter that should not be overlooked."
"Twinfinite","80","Though its single-player campaign is a little lackluster when it comes to story, it does a good enough job at providing some context to the chaos of the online component, and the mix of platforming and shooting stopped the experience from getting too repetitive. In terms of multiplayer, Titanfall 2 is a sequel in every sense of the word. It’s bigger, better, and nips many of the issues with its predecessor in the bud."
"Game Revolution","80","The single-player campaign is a blast while the multiplayer is solid if only slightly underwhelming. Kudos to the developer for creating a work of fun that made me chuckle, smile, and feel good. Who knew an iron giant, accompanied by clever level design, would steal my heart?"
"USgamer","80","Although it's a little on the short side, and its production values are a bit oldschool, Titanfall 2's single-player campaign is a really enjoyable experience while it lasts. It's very inventive and fun, and a great warm-up for the game's excellent multiplayer component, whose gunplay and controls are absolutely outstanding. All it needs is a few more maps and modes."
"Gameblog.fr","80","This time with Titanfall 2, we have a solo campaign, and it's a good one! With the boosted multiplayer mode, the experience is now complete and all the great FPS around now have a great competitor to fight with."
"Shacknews","70","The addition of a single-player campaign was a huge positive for this series, especially due to the bizarre twists and turns it takes throughout. In a year filled with outstanding shooters in both the single and multiplayer fronts, Titanfall 2 does just enough to prove it can hang with the others, even if it is re-treading old ground."
