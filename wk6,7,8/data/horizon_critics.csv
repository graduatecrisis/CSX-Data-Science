"LEVEL (Czech Republic)","100","Horizon Zero Dawn is a perfect proof, that if you give developers creative freedom and time, it will get you a sweet reward. For fans of action adventures and wonderful worlds Horizon is the obvious choice. [Issue#272]"
"Playstation Official Magazine Australia","100","A stunningly good start to what will surely become a treasured PlayStation series. Brilliant stuff. [April 2017, p.71]"
"RPGamer","100","Horizon Zero Dawn is as close to a flawless RPG as one could hope for; developer Guerilla Games went for the gold in every respect, and it shows. The game boasts immense production values in its gorgeous art direction, and is stuffed to the gills with great voiceover performances, atmospheric and tuneful music, and visceral sound effects work. Even more importantly, it provides a top-notch story that delights in plunging the unsuspecting player headfirst down a rabbit hole of epic proportions, far and away its strongest achievement."
"Toronto Sun","100","Amsterdam-based studio Guerilla Games, best known for PlayStation’s grim but visually impressive Killzone franchise, spent more than six years on Horizon Zero Dawn, and it shows: in the beauty of the game’s visuals, the depth of its backstory and the tightness of its design. Hopefully this isn’t the last we’ll see of this high-tech savage land. (Horizon Forbidden West, maybe? Please?)"
"Slant Magazine","100","This game is, above all else, a narrative triumph: a nuanced hero's journey that blends tried-and-tested tribal fantasy tropes to a particularly poignant and humanistic brand of post-apocalyptic sci-fi."
"Gaming Age","100","If you own a PlayStation 4 or are thinking about getting one in the near future there’s not many excuses to not pick up Horizon: Zero Dawn. The five years of time and effort that Guerrilla Games poured into the title is evident, and it’s certainly one of the best open world action RPG experiences in recent memory."
"DualShockers","100","An absolutely fantastic game. It’s very polished, and comes with a compelling story, relatable characters, an absolutely fascinating setting, and top-notch gameplay. On top of that, its visuals will make you wonder if Santa secretly sneaked into your room to replace your PS4 with a gaming PC while you were asleep. It simply looks that good."
"Giant Bomb","100","Horizon: Zero Dawn is familiar but also really refreshing. It's not a short game (I spent around 30 hours with it), but the storytelling still feels concise and efficient. The combat has some nice options that make encounters fun, even when you're just stacking up stealth kills from the relative safety of a bush. And the presentation end of the game holds up its end of things with a solid soundtrack, great voice acting, and a cohesive design that makes all its disparate parts fit together. All in all, it's a great game, it's Guerrilla's strongest release to date."
"Twinfinite","100","Its magical world is a wonder to explore, it controls and looks exceptional, and the unique, modular build of its enemies ensures that combat never gets old. Yes, items could have been more accessible, and I was left with more questions than answers by the end, but these were mere speed bumps in the bigger picture. Horizon Zero Dawn is the PS4’s first major exclusive of 2017, and it couldn’t have gotten much better."
"Telegraph","100","On the surface, Horizon seems like a jumble of influences but, just like the murderous machina wandering its lands, the game is far more than its component parts, delivering a gripping story, satisfying combat, and the most gorgeous video game environments I’ve ever seen. Horizon confidently carves out an identity of its own in an overpopulated genre."
"PlayStation LifeStyle","100","Horizon Zero Dawn is an early contender for game of the year. Guerrilla Games has outdone themselves, in astounding fashion. This is a glorious game, the result of a team of masterful artisans who not only had a story that they wished to tell, but a world that was living inside of them which they wanted to share with us all. Now, we get to play inside their creation, and it is a breathtaking experience to behold. A massive, open world filled with equally massive, terrifying robots, juxtaposed against the beauty of the Earth, nature fighting back the darkness as it tends to do. Horizon Zero Dawn is the kind of game you play to get lost in, and can be enjoyed by players of all types. This could be the beginning of a stellar franchise, and there is something for everyone here. If you own a PS4, you owe it to yourself to give Horizon Zero Dawn a go."
"COGconnected","100","Horizon Zero Dawn is a sweeping epic, magically dancing across the lines between sci-fi and fantasy, masterfully intertwining two genres that traditionally have held their own space in gaming. It is Guerrilla Games' crowning achievement in video game development. Words cannot do justice for what you need to see for yourself."
"Gaming Nexus","98","I got on the hype train early for this one, and I must say that Guerrilla Games delivers a nearly flawless gem of a game. Horizon: Zero Dawn is an exceptional title from start to finish and is an absolute must for any gamer, old or new."
"Digital Chumps","98","The gameplay design here has the best of everything with the minimum amount of flaws. You get a great back-end system with an easy front end that provides an entirely new view on how much fun a bow and arrow led game could be. In addition to the gameplay design details, there’s also so much to explore and so much to do with the gameplay design put together in HZD. All of it is fun, addictive and makes you wish it wouldn’t end."
"Game Over Online","98","Horizon Zero Dawn is Guerrilla Games’ best effort, one of the PS4’s greatest games, and the best game ever crafted from the ground up for the platform. It combines a gripping narrative with intense action that blends both fast-paced combat with slower-paced, tense stealth sections perfectly. Everything about their vision for this game clicks into place and is accentuated by a stellar presentation. The game features top-shelf graphical work, a unique and enjoyable soundtrack, alongside a fantastic cast to make an unforgettable experience."
"Cheat Code Central","98","Heading out into the world of Horizon Zero Dawn to take down these massive machines is an exhilarating feeling, which combines well with a story that gradually unfurls and engages its audience."
"Vgames","97","By looking at this game alone, you would've never imagined Guerilla Games' previous works were on FPS games. Horizon: Zero Dawn reaches perfection in almost all of its aspects and it does so with relative ease. Aloy is an amazing character, a true bad-ass with a great story behind her, and the world she lives in is vast and full of interesting and unique characters and secrets. The combat, while a tad lacking, is extremely fun and addictive and the graphics are some of the best seen on the system with breath-taking vistas. If you happen to own a PS4, you should buy this game. If you don't, then you might want a PS4 for this one. Guerilla Games went and set the bar high for future open world games with this one."
"XGN","97","Guerilla Games has set the bar while it ventures into a new genre. The game looks phenomenal, and it offers variety, tens of hours of fun and an accessible system. It challenges you in every fight to play intelligently. This may be the best game of 2017."
"Impulsegamer","96","There’s been much hype surrounding Horizon Zero Dawn and thankfully it has delivered in more ways than one. It boasts a very likeable and interesting protagonist and the story behind Horizon Zero Dawn is one that is filled with mystery and intrigue. Of course, it’s all about the gameplay and Guerrilla should be commended in creating such a fluid and dynamic game as you explore this post-apocalyptic world 1000 years in the future that is filled with different cultures and even history which seems so real. Combat is fun and the missions are diverse and at the end of the day, Horizon Zero Dawn is a title that really raises the benchmark on the PlayStation 4."
"AusGamers","96","While the main storyline was lacking, there's a reason good world-building is critical to good fantasy, and like I said, this game nails it. I loved about the game was the way it used Aloy's Focus to force you to examine things. Each new area becomes a crime scene as Aloy examines and analyses what's been left behind. It's a clever way to blend the idea of technology into this otherwise primitive world."
"App Trigger","95","Horizon Zero Dawn has an unforgettable protagonist, world, story, visuals, soundtrack and gameplay. Due to minor issues with inventory management and quest selection, I cannot call it perfect but I can say it is absolutely worth your time."
"Games Master UK","95","PS4's best exclusive, and an exhilarating new IP that spits at sequelitis. An instant open-world classic. [April 2017, p.74]"
"Wccftech","95","Horizon Zero Dawn is a pure sign of what can be completed with an exceptionally designed open world. Not only that, it has exceptional characterisation and a sincere story that doesn't shoehorn elements, allowing for the organic growth of characters. This is a game that I can barely find any faults with, except borrowing some elements from other open world games. Even so, it made each and every element its own in one of the best games to date."
"Let's Play Video Games","95","It’s an open world game that kept me engaged and enthralled from start to finish, featured a simplified and polished variant on a combat loop I love, and felt made with a passion and sincerity rare in AAA video games. Horizon: Zero Dawn is right now my favourite game on the PlayStation 4 by quite a long way. It truly is worth of praise."
"PSX-Sense.nl","95","A great story, outstanding visuals and very enjoyable gameplay. Brilliant in every single way. Guerrilla once more cements its reputation as one of PlayStation's very best developers."
"Arcade Sushi","95","Horizon Zero Dawn is compelling from the first minutes of the game, telling an incredible story and marking it with a deep crafting system and exceptional combat. Aloy is inspiring in her lead role, with the potential to become a new leading face in gaming for a long time to come."
"Hobby Consolas","95","Horizon: Zero Dawn is Guerrilla's biggest game to date, and not just from a technical standpoint. It's also one hell of an action RPG, thanks to a complex and satisfying combat system. The story and universe are also huge; Aloy's future is already shining on the horizon. A star is born."
"Gamer.nl","95","It's not often that a game of this caliber lives up to all expectations. Horizon Zero Dawn starts slowly, but transforms in a huge action adventure. We haven't been obsessed with a virtual world to this degree since The Witcher 3. Horizon impresses in every facet imaginable."
"Polygon","95","Horizon Zero Dawn thrums with the energy of a creative team finally allowed to explore something new. It builds on elements of open-world and loot-and-craft gameplay that we've seen before, but it does so within a context, a setting and a style that feel fresh. Horizon Zero Dawn discovers a stronger sense of its own personality in one game than Killzone ever managed across half a dozen. Guerrilla Games has long been developing some of the most buzzed-about games in the industry; with Horizon, it feels like it has finally found its own voice, one worthy of all that buzz."
"Playstation Universe","95","Horizon Zero Dawn reinvigorates open-world RPGs with an excellent story, creative science fiction, and demanding gameplay. Aloy’s debut is one of PS4’s greatest games."
"The Jimquisition","95","Horizon: Zero Dawn is just brilliant. I speak as a critic who has played more ""open sandbox"" games than any one human should and has grown so very weary of them. I should have gotten sick of this thing in an hour, but I've been glued to it for days and days and I  don't want it to end. I love existing in this world - a world of desperate survival but of growing culture and a sense of hope. A world of giant metal animals that promise some breathtaking fights."
"God is a Geek","95","It’s been a long time since a game has been put together this well. The combat is awesome, the visuals are stunning, and Aloy is 100% badass."
"Atomix","93","I am happy to see that Horizon: Zero Dawn is not just a huge balloon inflated with hype, but that they've really done a good job in injecting a lot of personality with good technical achievements that characterize them and also the creation of a World with interesting characters, a good campaign and so much depth in their spaces and societies that we very much crave to return in future sequels."
"Areajugones","93","Horizon Zero Dawn is as good as everybody expected. A powerful narrative and solid gameplay make this Guerrilla game one of the best titles that 2017 has to offer."
"IGN","93","Across a vast and beautiful open world, Horizon: Zero Dawn juggles many moving parts with polish and finesse. Its main activity - combat - is extremely satisfying thanks to the varied design and behaviors of machine-creatures that roam its lands, each of which needs to be taken down with careful consideration. Though side questing could have been more imaginative, its missions are compelling thanks to a central mystery that led me down a deep rabbit hole to a genuinely surprising - and moving - conclusion."
"Pelit (Finland)","92","Quotation forthcoming. [March 2017]"
"IGN Spain","92","There's so much to love in Horizon: Zero Dawn. You may love its gameplay, its magnificent world, its crisp visuals or the excellent sound design. An experience that's worth taking."
"Meristation","92","Horizon: Zero Dawn is probably the best Guerrilla game ever and one of the most solid open world experiences that we've seen recently. A true must-have for Playstation 4 owners."
"Everyeye.it","92","Guerrilla Games did it. Horizon: Zero Dawn is one of the best Open-World games of this generation. It's a wonderful action-RPG set in a vast and unforgettable universe, with a solid (but conventional) plot and - most of all - challenging gameplay."
"Playstation Official Magazine UK","90","A brilliant mix of accessible RPG elements, exhilaratingly fluid action and awe-inspiring environments that consistently captivate.  Anchored by the charmingly blunt Aloy, Guerrilla crafts an experience that will live long in the memory. [Apr 2017, p.80]"
"GameSpew","90","With a large, beautiful, varied open world, a compelling central mystery, interesting side-quests and top of the field gameplay, Horizon Zero Dawn is easily Guerilla Games’ best effort yet and by far one of the best games this generation so far."
"PlayStation Country","90","A graphically impressive game Horizon Zero Dawn offers an engaging open world and an interesting story. The combat is nuanced and taking down the larger beasts feels really rewarding. This is a must buy."
"The Digital Fix","90","Horizon is a must-play title for any PS4 owner, which boasts a remarkable lead character and a rich, thrilling open world."
"BaziCenter","90","Horizon: Zero Dawn offers everything we've already seen and expected from an open-world action-RPG title. Yet, it feels much more different from anything we have ever experienced. Despite a few flaws, Horizon: Zero Dawn is an excellent action-RPG. One that proves that new ideas is not enough, knowing how to develop them is all that matters."
"Games.cz","90","Excellently made action adventure with RPG elements in a large open world is only a foundation. The creators of Killzone piled up lots of good ideas, innovations and systems that together move the genre bar higher."
"GameCrate","90","Horizon Zero Dawn is one of the most entertaining open world games I have played in a while. It’s a truly creative take in an otherwise saturated genre."
"Edge Magazine","90","Horizon: Zero Dawn is an enormous, ambitious curve ball from the studio behind the promising but perennially flawed Killzone series. In Aloy, the game introduces an enchanting protagonist and sets her on a remarkable adventure that steers clear of rote sci-fi...Horizon emerges as a graceful, intoxicating and often surprising adventure. [April 2017, p.108]"
"Critical Hit","90","Horizon Zero Dawn is a love letter to the finer details, as they reinvigorate an open-world setting in startling ways. Its tight combat and engrossing world are icing on a package that just shines from all angles, making it an easy recommendation to not only play on PS4, but to buy one in the first place."
"The Sydney Morning Herald","90","Horizon is a special game, one which puts forth a very confident spin on action-RPG conventions and on the idea of a post-apocalyptic survival tale, but also one that will engross you in its mystery and poke at common humanistic ideas from an angle we don't see a whole lot. That said, it certainly doesn't hurt that it's amazing to look at and has heaps of cool robots to blow up, and its actual game mechanics are just as engaging as the story it tells."
"SpazioGames","90","Horizon Zero Dawn is one of the best open world games of this generation, a really solid experience and a great piece of work from Guerrilla."
"EGM","90","Horizon Zero Dawn is a great choice for those craving action and adventure. With a terrific combat system, a strong female protagonist, and a deep pool of side content, it will surely go down as one of PlayStation’s star exclusives."
"Yahoo!","90","It successfully marries open-world shenanigans with a great story, a “Witcher”-sized challenge, and keeps it humming with smart, addictive combat against a tide of brilliant enemies. Our species might lack good judgment from time to time, but “Horizon” proves we’re still worth saving."
"Post Arcade (National Post)","90","It is, put plainly, a game of enormous scope; one that feels remarkably original in both its setting and presentation. It’s a work of grand imagination. And Aloy – a strong, confident, and captivating heroine who gradually earns and commands the respect of everyone around her, from matriarchs all the way up to a king – serves as a delightfully likeable anchor around which everything is spun."
"JeuxActu","90","Known for the Killzone IP, Guerrilla Games has created a masterpiece in Horizon: Zero Dawn with its unique universe, its massive and rich open-world and its gorgeous graphics."
"GamesRadar+","90","An open-world that tailors to each and every interest, Horizon: Zero Dawn keeps combat fresh, with an intriguing protagonist to match."
"Trusted Reviews","90","I didn’t expect Horizon: Zero Dawn to be this good. I doubt I’ll be the only one saying they were surprised that the Killzone developer has been able to deliver a game with such breadth, depth and consistently rewarding gameplay...Couple all of that with a compelling story led by an engaging lead protagonist and you have a brilliant game, an absolute must-buy for all PS4 owners...Those with a PS4 Pro and an HDR TV will find an even more beautiful experience on offer, but everybody who plays Horizon: Zero Dawn is in for an absolute treat."
"Gameplanet","90","Guerrilla Games' punt on a new IP has paid off handsomely, as despite its silly title, Horizon Zero Dawn is a magnificent open world action-adventure that lives up to its hype."
"GamePro Germany","90","Guerilla's open world debut offers great gameplay, is huge and looks fantastic. A must-buy for PS4 owners."
"RPG Site","90","I took approximately thirty-five hours to complete Horizon Zero Dawn’s main story, but the first thing I did after I finished was dive right back in. There were still exciting quests to do, gorgeous places to discover, and fascinating characters to meet. I’m still falling in love with this world and all the magnificent things it has to offer. Guerrilla Games has created something truly impressive and memorable with their first dive into the genre, and I have only endless excitement for all that’s in store for the future of this universe."
"Merlin'in Kazanı (Turkey)","90","Horizon: Zero Dawn starts as Aloy's personal story and then turns into a bigger, wider experience. Thanks to its fantastic and stuffed open world, its one of the best games of 2017 already."
"LaPS4","90","Horizon Zero Dawn is a nice surprise because rarely is a game such as this is able to surpass expectations. It isn't just a game with a great plot; it isn't just a technical marvel; it isn't just a game with great, addictive gameplay mechanics. It is all of these things and much more. It is, above all, an Aloy that shines on its own, able to rise as the new PlayStation female hero."
"The Games Machine","90","Horizon Zero Dawn is an instant classic: tough, challenging, huge, incredibly fun to play. It's the new definition of the videogame in the most classical way, where the center of the experience is the genuine entertainment of the player. There are some minor flaws here and there, and the narrative isn't as strong as it could've been, but nonetheless, it's the best action game of this generation."
"Gamer.no","90","Horizon Zero Dawn takes the best traits of the open-world genre and melts them together into Guerrilla's own, polished and refreshing vision. The voice acting, nuanced character roster and many fun ways to approach combat makes this a game I’d gladly see become Sony's next big flagship franchise."
"M3","90","Horizon: Zero Dawn doesn't reinvent the wheel – but it delivers an immersive action experience, set in a gorgeous world with lots of mysteries and thrilling encounters."
"3DJuegos","90","With its perfectly balanced free-roaming experience and an amazing world to explore, Horizon: Zero Dawn is a great addition to the PS4 library."
"Game Revolution","90","There is a certain appeal to Horizon: Zero Dawn which I have not found in any other open-world RPG game. Perhaps it is the addition of shiny robots to the mix or the story of Aloy herself. Either way, this game has my full attention and I wouldn't call it anything less than stellar. If I had to compare it to another game, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and Shadow of Mordor would be on the top of my list. When compared to these two titles, Horizon is riddled with less bugs, more engaging combat, and successfully incorporates stealth gameplay. Try and guess what I’ll be playing for the next few weeks."
"Game Rant","90","Dark Souls, Far Cry Primal (or any open world Ubisoft game), Uncharted – these are just a few of the games players will cite when finding points of comparison for Horizon: Zero Dawn. But the Guerrilla Games developers have made sure that its game still feels unique by comparison, thanks to a vibrant world bursting with stunning detail, challenging robotic enemies, and a story that explores an uncivilized world in an inventive way. Some weak AI, awkward dialogue sections, and a prototypical open world framework are the game’s bigger faults, but they don’t weigh the game down to much or ruin the experience. When all is said and done, Horizon: Zero Dawn could easily be Sony’s next great franchise, but even as a one-off it’s very impressive."
"Shacknews","90","When I began Horizon: Zero Dawn, I was anxious it wouldn't be able to maintain itself for thirty-plus hours. I'm thrilled that fear was unfounded. The play was constantly rich and rewarding, and the mysteries constantly unfolding. I'm left not just feeling satisfied the entire time, but wanting more. This one is something special."
"Forbes","90","No, Horizon probably isn’t as monumental of an experience as playing Uncharted or God of War for the first time, but it’s well-made, engaging and probably worth your time."
"Push Square","90","Debuts don't get much stronger than Horizon: Zero Dawn. Guerrilla Games' latest borrows liberally from a variety of different sources, and yet it leverages these fundamentals to forge an experience that's daringly unique. The main quest tires a little towards the end, and the writing never hits the same highs as The Witcher 3 – but the tactical action stands leagues ahead of what we've come to expect from the genre, and the presentation is quite simply unmatched."
"We Got This Covered","90","Horizon Zero Dawn is a stunningly gorgeous game, an awesome open world action-RPG that overcomes the gameplay conventions of the genre by giving you so many options on how to tackle combat. It does stumble a bit trying to tell a cohesive story, but I was too caught up in exploring all the little details of the world to let that bother me."
"Hardcore Gamer","90","This is a culmination of everything Guerrilla has learned from working on the Killzone franchise and they've successfully crafted something that delivers on the potential many saw back in 2015. Horizon Zero Dawn is not only one of the best-looking games of this generation, but a must own for every PlayStation 4 owner."
"GameSpot","90","Guerilla Games has delivered one of the best open-world games of this generation."
"Eurogamer Italy","90","Horizon Zero Dawn is an amazing game and a gorgeous experience, crafted with elements and ideas from many other games. Despite its lack OF originality, this product from Guerrilla Games is a great piece of work."
"Attack of the Fanboy","90","A likeable new protagonist in Aloy, alongside a compelling story, deep combat system and stunning visuals – Guerrilla Games has already raised the bar this year for exclusives with Horizon: Zero Dawn."
"Gameblog.fr","90","Few new licenses have been successful in setting the bar so high. Thanks to its varied, dazzling landscapes, its controlled rhythm, and sharp gameplay, Aloy's quest redefines what immersion in an open world means, if it does not revolutionize the genre."
"RPG Fan","88","Even though it's not without its issues, Horizon is an excellent title and a must have for all PS4 owners. It offers a refreshing open world environment, a compelling and mysterious story, a fantastic main character, and innovative gameplay. Not only is it one of the best action RPGs I've played in a while, it's also one of the best games I've played in a while. Even now, after the credits have rolled, I'm still having a great time trying to fully complete the game. Horizon is a truly special experience, and it's one that even non-RPG lovers need to have."
"Vandal","88","A spectacular and entertaining open world adventure that becomes one of the must-have exclusives of PS4."
"Game Informer","88","None of Horizon's faults stopped me from sinking 55 hours into the game, or walking away supremely satisfied with the experience. Horizon may not be a revolution for the open-world genre, but it is a highly polished and compelling adventure that proves Guerrilla is more than a single franchise."
"Multiplayer.it","88","Horizon is a kind of rough diamond. It has great value but some flaws too, especially regarding the voice acting and the fights against humans. Having said that, Guerrilla has managed to create a believable world full of great moments."
"IGN Italia","87","Horizon: Zero Dawn is a successful ""first time"" for Guerrilla in the open world genre. The game isn't perfect, but it's gorgeous to see and explore (best open world graphics ever) and offers engaging fights against fascinating machines."
"GamesBeat","87","Like with God of War and Uncharted before, Horizon: Zero Dawn should be the start of another PlayStation iconic franchise. It offers a gorgeous and interesting world rich with adventure (including plenty of giant robots to kill). While it borrows heavily from the likes of Far Cry, it’s a more interesting and less repetitive effort than we’ve seen from that series. The presentation suffers a few hiccups, but it’s mostly a beautiful game. It’s also a long one. Horizon will keep you busy for a good chunk of time with its multitude of side-quests and extra activities. This is one of the PlayStation 4’s most interesting exclusives."
"4Players.de","86","This action roleplaying game demonstrates not only the technical competence of Guerilla Games. In terms of storytelling, quest design and characterization it almost reaches The Witcher 3. So even with its flaws like the abundance of crafting material and the superficial close combat this is another great franchise for the PS4."
"LevelUp","86","Horizon: Zero Dawn represents the birth of a new and promising IP, thanks to a clever concept, solid combat mechanics and an outstanding presentation. Having said that, it can be repetitive at times and the lack of spontaneity stops Horizon: Zero Dawn from being a true classic."
"TrueGaming","85","A few years ago, Guerrilla Games gave us a sneak peek of something great. Today, we receive an artistic open-world game with an extremely fun hunting adventure with unusual targets."
"Worth Playing","85","A perfect example of strong, competent and enjoyable gameplay. It doesn't reinvent the genre, but it's a lot of fun to play. The mecha-dino combat is the highlight and represents some of the most enjoyable open-world combat on the market. Burning through powerful foes and looting their corpses for rare treasures captures an excitement rarely felt in open-world games. The rest of the gameplay is somewhat dulled in comparison. A somewhat weak plot drags down the experience but isn't enough to detract from the enjoyment."
"GRYOnline.pl","85","Horizon: Zero Dawn marks Guerilla Games' return to form and is a showcase for what PS4 can do. Of course, it's far from perfect but thanks to diverse landscapes, excellent graphics and wildly satisfying combat mechanics Horizon looks really impressive. Just don't let the boring first two hours discourage you."
"GamingTrend","85","Horizon Zero Dawn is an excellent open-world experience that puts fighting towering robots at the center of the action. It’s held back somewhat by its weak narrative, and occasional glitches, but that doesn’t stop it from being the most badass game I’ve played this year."
"PLAY! Zine","85","Horizon Zero Dawn is a beautiful open world action adventure with some light RPG elements. It has a good and interesting story in addition to excellent hunting mechanics, but there's also a lack of character diversity and personalities."
"CGMagazine","85","Horizon Zero Dawn is the gaming equivalent of realizing that sounding too much like the legends—when done well—is just fine."
"Game World Navigator Magazine","81","Guerrilla Games made their first open world game playing straight every trope in the book. In her time off from story missions, Aloy-from-the-future will do the same stuff as Renaissance Ezio and Stone Age tribal from Far Cry Primal did: she’ll capture towers, liberate camps, look for collectibles, and, of course, hunt to craft bigger quivers and larger bags. [Issue#217, p.48]"
"CD-Action","80","Although Horizon Zero Dawn is a variation on the tested “ubigame” formula and fails to even get close to The Witcher 3 in terms of utilizing the open world, amazing setting makes it a beautiful science fiction fairy tale that manages to stay gripping till the very end. [04/2017, p.62]"
"games(TM)","80","It might not be Witcher III level of excellence, but for a first attempt from Guerrilla, it’s impressively close."
"IBTimes UK","80","Horizon: Zero Dawn is a stellar open world game. Guerrilla has crafted a magnificent and utterly gorgeous adventure game with surprising depth that rewards player skill and will more than likely prove to be PS4's next major action franchise. It's just a shame the game's open world is so desperate to validate its own existence that it never lets you truly enjoy the thrill of the hunt."
"GameOver.gr","80","By borrowing many ideas from other games (the reboot of Tomb Raider and Far Cry Primal to be more specific) Guerilla’s maiden voyage into the “open-world” genre is quite successful, engaging and charming, but not without its flaws."
"Washington Post","80","It is wish fulfillment of a high order: Eden 2.0 with gadgets."
"New York Daily News","80","It’s a world unlike any other, offering traits borrowed and traits new. And it’s one of the most captivating open worlds you’ve ever experienced."
"Digital Spy","80","Horizon: Zero Dawn is simply great fun to play – the open world and fantastic enemies make it easy to get on board with the surreal premise which Guerrilla Games has crafted. The challenging gameplay always tempts you to push past the next mountain, through new cities or delving into caves to discover new beasts, secrets and gear...Its razor-sharp graphics will have you relentlessly hitting the PS4's share button, even if the story can't quite capture you in the same way."
"ZTGD","80","From its gorgeous landscapes to its interesting combat, the game feels like a world begging to be explored. However, some of its systems feel half-baked and shoehorned into the mix, creating a lopsided experience at times."
"Guardian","80","On the one hand Horizon: Zero Dawn is an ambitious technological showpiece for Sony’s new PlayStation Pro platform and a visual benchmark for this console generation. And yet its underlying hunter/gathering gameplay mechanics and zonal map architecture have barely evolved from their obvious origins in the long-established franchises Far Cry and Tomb Raider."
"New Game Network","80","Horizon Zero Dawn offers an entirely unique world and a thrilling experience as an action game, complete with a great story and likeable characters. It doesn't reach its grand RPG aspirations, but the highs are so memorable and entertaining that it's easy to forgive the shortcomings."
"NZGamer","80","Aloy’s quest through the post-post-apocalypse is one of pros and cons. Encounters with robotic wildlife are equal parts tactical and reflexive, but fights against humans are awkward, and the camera is unwieldly. The world is lush and gorgeous, but traversing it can be a chore. Horizon Zero Dawn is a breath of fresh air, and a welcome departure from Guerrilla’s previous offerings – but the journey takes some missteps."
"DarkStation","80","From a technical standpoint, the game is a real darling and can compete with the best of them. And yet it’s that the game doesn’t really break away from any of the pre-existing molds that I believe hold it back from being the breakout hit of 2017. It feels almost too conventional. Whether it’s the Ubisoft style side missions, the Batman Arkham vision or the by the numbers storytelling. There’s nothing about Horizon Zero Dawn that breaks out into its own unique experience. I absolutely loved this game. I think it’s a fantastic adventure full of amazing experiences to be had and fully recommend it to anyone who owns a Playstation 4. And yet it does feel like the first game in a series that needs to discover its own unique identity to help it stand out amongst a vast array of open world games that it competes against."
"The Daily Dot","80","The open-world sensations of Horizon Zero Dawn are some of the best of the current console generation. Climbing snow-capped mountains and crawling through verdant valleys never fails to be as exciting. This apocalyptic wasteland feels remarkably dynamic, with randomized characters and enemies roaming the world and creating emergent encounters...Though Horizon doesn’t represent a revolution in open-world adventures, it borrows heavily from past success stories and elevates the genre to a beautiful new standard."
"VideoGamer","80","Destroying large robot beasts while frantically switching between weapons is intoxicating, but the strength of Horizon Zero Dawn is in Aloy's engaging quest to find out who she really is."
"Metro GameCentral","80","State-of-the-art visuals help create one of gaming’s most entertaining open worlds, even if the gameplay doesn’t quite reach the same standards."
"Easy Allies","80","Horizon Zero Dawn feels like a franchise in the making. While not packed with narrative high points, it’s still a compelling introduction to a world in turmoil that answers a lot of questions, but still gestures toward a more climactic future. Its primary element, squaring off against mechanized animals, is such a success, it makes up for the ongoing repetition of the game’s activities. When we look into Horizon’s future, we see a sequel that can take this world and make it into something remarkable."
"TheSixthAxis","80","Horizon: Zero Dawn is a bit of a slow burn, but there's more to Guerrilla Games' latest than just its staggeringly pretty graphics. The story surprises as it takes several twists and turns and explores the past, but the games beating heart is with its excellently tense and engaging robotic monster hunting."
"Riot Pixels","75","There is enough spectacular action to keep you occupied for a couple of weeks, but Horizon is not the hot new killer app for PS4."
"Destructoid","75","Horizon Zero Dawn is a fascinating premise wrapped in a tortilla of tropes."
"Digitally Downloaded","70","The creative team needs to find writers willing to back up the narrative context with a story that has meat, and the gameplay designers need to dare do things differently to what has come before. Horizon is a remarkably refined and technically brilliant game, but Guerrilla has yet to prove that it can take that next step and produce a genuine classic."
"Stevivor","70","For all the hype that’s been extended to Horizon: Zero Dawn, it hasn’t managed to fully deliver. That’s a bit fitting — while we didn’t have access to its day one patch, confirmed by Eschler to enhance the PS4 Pro experience, I really didn’t notice an increased framerate or up-then-downrezzed textures on my 1080p television. Truly, there’s a lot of promise and potential in Guerrilla’s latest work, but ideas and intentions haven’t come together in a way that’s jaw-dropping."
"GameCritics","65","The sad fact for Horizon, and every other open-world game like it, is that we now live in a post-Witcher 3 world. CD Projekt Red has raised the bar for this genre in nearly every conceivable way, and it is absolutely not enough to simply be another open-world game. The sidequests have to be interesting, the writing has to be engaging, the characters have to be memorable – just putting a good premise and great graphics on top of boilerplate content isn’t enough. At least, it’s not enough for this reviewer."
"Quarter to Three","60","The unfortunate fact of Horizon is that most of what it does well, other games have done better, and they did it with a compelling who and where. This is the game you play after you’ve finished The Witcher 3, Assassin’s Creed: Syndicate, and Far Cry: Primal. It is the greatest hits compilation of open-world games. Yeah, sure, you might want to own it, but the real connoisseur has the original albums."
"USgamer","50","Horizon Zero Dawn is disappointing. It has a story that I struggled to care about (complete with massive expository dumps—yay), a bland protagonist, and overtly repetitive and constraining missions that worked against its open world sensibilities. When Horizon Zero Dawn hit its rare strides—from its gloomy Cauldrons to traveling across its sprawling vistas—it only made me wish the rest of the game were as worthwhile."
