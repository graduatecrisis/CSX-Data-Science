"Eurogamer Germany","100","You'll get everything the fantastic console version had: a feeling of insecurity, respect for the apparently insurmountable, an unparalleled combat system. A nigh on perfect game."
"God is a Geek","100","It is far and away the superior version, and that’s without the need to download any sort of fan-made patch. The cycle of death and success has never felt this good."
"Gaming Age","100","If you’ve patiently waited for the PC release, consider yourself rewarded for said patience. This is hands-down the best version of Dark Souls 2 you’ll be able to get, and shows a massive improvement over the lackluster effort that went into the first PC release of Dark Souls."
"Ragequit.gr","98","Dark Souls 2 is not just a perfectly designed video game. It's a dark journey into a painful world of souls, a bet with your inner self and your strengths, the purification and absolute completion when the end credits fall... it's an experience like no other."
"Game Informer","98","The PC version of Dark Souls II is the definitive one to own. It’s a good step up in the graphics and performance departments, annoying load times are drastically reduced, and players can even opt to play with the mouse and keyboard if they so desire. It shows that From Software spent a considerable amount of time attempting to come up with controls that would feel natural on the PC."
"CD-Action","95","This game’s playability puts to shame everything that’s been released for the new generation of consoles. [06/2014, p.54]"
"Gamers' Temple","95","Never has a game so difficult been so rewarding."
"Gameplanet","95","This time around, From Software has nailed the PC version of its beloved franchise, leaving absolutely no doubt as to which platform gives players the best experience."
"3DJuegos","95","Dark Souls II keep marking his very own label that players love. If you're a fan of the series, you’ve got a new journey to play and replay until the world fall back into darkness."
"Multiplayer.it","93","Finally, From Software manages to create a game on its own and not a lazy port. Dark Souls II is exactly the best way to play the masterpiece console gamers experienced a few weeks ago."
"Vandal","93","From Software has not made the mistakes they made with the first episode on PC, but the improvements are limited to AI, resolution and framerate. Still, a great game worth playing."
"IGN Italia","93","A truly unique experience, but it's not for everybody. You have to be aware of the words you're gonna read more than any others on your screen: ""You're Dead""."
"Meristation","93","Dark Souls II is an ideal game for veteran players, but it's also a good chance for newcomers. From Software added some positive concessions while keeping the essence of the franchise. Action, exploration, replay value and great online experiences in another sweet nightmare. Prepare to die once again."
"XGN","92","From Software has clearly learned from its earlier mistakes by creating an absolutely wonderful PC version this time around. Shame about the monstrous keyboard and mouse controls, but nothing a controller won't fix. Aside of that, the core gameplay really shines, because of the many subtle improvements the PC version enjoys. The biggest achievement, however, is that one of the greatest games of 2014 has managed to become even greater."
"Pelit (Finland)","91","Dark Souls 2 respects gamers: it does not treat them like clueless, spoiled brogamerz, and that is something every publisher could learn from. [May 2014]"
"PC Gamer","91","More accessible, challenging, and rewarding than its predecessor, this is the Dark Souls sequel PC gamers deserve."
"PC PowerPlay","90","The definitive Dark Souls II experience, the latest entry to The Souls series shines on the PC. [June 2014, p.50]"
"Gaming Nexus","90","The PC port is just as good, if not better than it's console counterpart, but you're going to want to use a gamepad. Using a keyboard is possible, and there's even a few mods out there to make it more functional and ergonomic, but it's still clunky and unintuitive compared to using a controller."
"Digital Chumps","90","Dark Souls II, as its blessing and its curse, is not another Dark Souls. It is, however, more Dark Souls - and it makes good on its hallowed name."
"PCGamesN","90","It’s a marriage of phenomenal world design and impressively tight mechanics."
"Metro GameCentral","90","A carefully considered sequel that avoids upsetting existing fans and offers an olive branch to newcomers – but although the PC version is the best it’s by a slimmer margin than many would’ve hoped."
"SpazioGames","90","From Software has learned a lesson from the modders. Dark Souls 2 is the port that had been promised, featuring rich graphics options and well optimized. Hats off."
"Digitally Downloaded","90","Dark Souls 2 offers glimpses of hope and illumination, but they always feel just out of reach. Scratching just below the surface to take on the challenges Dark Souls 2 has for you is where this game's appeal lies. The game will not be for everyone, but for those willing to tackle this game, it is a rewarding experience."
"Merlin'in Kazanı (Turkey)","90","Dark Souls II is a very difficult game more than the first one. PC controls still have the same problem: they're complicated. The story and the maps are much more beautiful, graphics seem better than one consoles. If you are a fan of the Dark Souls series, you'll definitely love this one."
"Eurogamer Italy","90","Praise the Sun: the PC version of Dark Souls II isn't the total mess that its predecessor was. It may not be the prettiest or most graphically advanced game, but it runs stable and smooth at a 1080p resolution with 60 fps, even on a moderately powerful machine. As for the game itself, there's little else to be said: it's still bloody difficult and engaging, a true hardcore masterpiece."
"Hardcore Gamer","90","If you decided to wait for the PC version of Dark Souls II before jumping in, you’ve made the right decision. It’s not leaps and bounds better than its console counterpart, but the graphical enhancements aid the immersion."
"GamingTrend","90","Dark Souls 2 for the PC is a far cleaner port attempt than the first Dark Souls port."
"IncGamers","90","In many ways Dark Souls 2 is the technical and functional superior of the first game, but it does lack some of the semi-intangible magic of the original like its superlative interconnected world. Nonetheless, an impressive and essential sequel."
"4Players.de","88","You’ll get higher resolutions and better framerates than on consoles. But with a game design of this quality, it doesn’t really matter. Right now there is nothing better for fans of action roleplaying games."
"Everyeye.it","87","60 fps and higher resolution: this time around the PC version of Dark Souls II has been made with more care. Still, there are a lot of bugs and problems, that will be hopefully corrected with some patches."
"ZTGD","85","It’s a testament to the series brand as a whole to make an otherwise solid title feel disappointing, but I’ve come to expect more and I hope they find the right path through the dark in the next sequel."
"Game Over Online","85","Games are simply developer-created hoops that we pay to jump through. In the case of Dark Souls 2, it’s not exactly fun to do the jumping, but rather “rewarding”. What are you rewarded with? An emotion, a rush."
"GameStar","85","If you can ignore the still not perfect controls on PC then Dark Souls 2 is a great game for hardcore gamers that can endure some suffering. They will scream in front of the screen - out of joy and out of frustration."
"Hooked Gamers","82","Despite the camera angle and controller issues, Dark Souls II is a great game."
"Riot Pixels","80","If you’re a fan of hardcore games, try Dark Souls 2. It is not as memorable as its predecessor, and yet it is still a phenomenal experience."
"MMORPG.com","80","This game is art in the good and bad sense of the word. It represents some of the best things that video games have to offer: at its most immersive, it offers a beautifully and thoughtfully rendered world to be explored that reveals itself not just through what is seen on the screen, but through the brutal and challenging experiences the player guides the in-game avatar through. The negative part of that is that the story of the game and the motivations and reasoning behind what is happening are obscure and unclear. A lot of the onus is on the player to piece things together. This is a kind of experience that is not necessarily designed to appeal to a broad swath of people, but its pitch perfect execution and strict adherence to its draconian design principles earn it a place in the pantheon of great games."
