Switch Brasil,100,"A more focused, more vibrant game that surpasses its predecessor and establishes itself as the best game on the Wii U and as the newest masterpiece of the genre."
Hyper Magazine,100,"Yes, even with sh.tty story and questionable gender politics. [Issue#255, p.64]"
Impulsegamer,100,"Bayonetta 2 is perfect on all levels that supports a flawless gaming engine, exceptional graphics and kick-ass female protagonist."
DarkStation,100,"Bayonetta 2 is a relentlessly entertaining ride from start to finish, with pacing meticulously designed to wring every last drop of adrenaline out of you before reigning things in with a quiet, humorous aside."
Digitally Downloaded,100,"Bayonetta 2 will challenge some people. It will make the uncomfortable. It's transgressive in numerous ways, and with that comes the potential to offend. But in causing offence, Bayonetta 2 encourages conversation, and that's the very definition of a good work of art."
Cubed3,100,"Bayonetta 2 is a Game of the Year contender, which comes extremely recommended."
Nintendojo,100,"Bayonetta 2 doesn\t do anything particularly new, but it does serve as an improvement of an already excellent action title, perfecting the formula even further."
Eurogamer Spain,100,"It's the obsession for detail that makes Bayonetta 2 so special. It might not be a unique game, but clearly one that's not common."
Meristation,100,"Bayonetta 2 is the best action game ever made. Masterclass in terms of combat system, depth and accessibility, with frantic and intense progress. Unforgettable challenging boss battles, full of content to unlock and a lovely main character."
Vandal,100,"Platinum Games manages to improve everything we knew and loved from the first game, creating a master piece everybody should play."
Guardian,100,"The sheer polish applied to every part of Bayonetta 2 is something every major studio should aspire to: the exceptional and wide-ranging soundtrack, the huge number of unlocks, the Nintendo easter eggs, the \making of\ materials, and the unlockable characters that bring their own style. Not a single thing has been held back. In this second adventure, Bayonetta over-delivers in every regard, and it will be a long time before another fighting game threatens her crown."
Giant Bomb,100,"Bayonetta 2 doesn\t drastically change the already wacky formula that the first game introduced, but it\s a bigger and more nuanced version of its predecessor. It\s also the best game of its kind in years. If you\ve ever enjoyed this breed of reflex-heavy, hyperactive, ludicrous action game, Bayonetta 2 is a no-brainer."
Gamereactor Denmark,100,"Bayonetta 2 is a triumphant return for the series and for Platinum Games. Extreme bosses, a crazy good style and an addictive co-op mode are just the icing on top of an excellent fighting system. Go get it now for your Wii U."
Eurogamer Germany,100,"Buy it if you liked the first one. Buy it, if you love it over the top all the way. Buy it if you love video games. Buy a Wii U if you have to. Bayonetta 2 sings all its praises in a celebration to this hobby of ours. But don't make the mistake of not playing it."
Destructoid,100,"It not only plays great, but there's so much style involved in just about every animation. Dashing turns you into a panther, double-jumping allows you to sprout butterfly wings, hovering turns you into a crow. Everything from the snapshot ""photo finish"" effect of completing a challenge room is painstakingly detailed."
Gameblog.fr,100,"With Bayonetta 2, Wii U has its trump card: a queen of spades that takes advantages on almost every game of the genre and hits us right in the heart. It's an outstanding production, beautifully executed, with state of the art mechanics and ridiculously generous. And it can be enjoyed by everyone as its difficulty and handling can be adjusted. Definitely a beat them all no one has the right to ignore."
God is a Geek,100,"Intense, gorgeous and thrilling to play, this is Platinum\s best game so far...A non-stop climax of excitement from the moment you start the Prologue, this is one of those games that demands to be played."
Joystiq,100,"Bayonetta 2 is the perfect action game. It oozes style and boasts gameplay that's both refined and lacking in excess. The combat is so purely entertaining that it's easy to lose yourself in the almost-zen flow of dodging, countering and kicking enemies to death."
GameSpot,100,"It is a masterclass in pure, unadulterated action-game design, where its insane eye-popping visuals meld effortlessly with some of the sharpest, most joyful combat to have ever graced a video game."
FNintendo,100,"Quite possibly the best action game ever made, Bayonetta 2 is a pure gem of wonder, filled with epic fights, perfect gameplay, a magnificent visual and sound environment and even a multiplayer mode which fits perfectly within the format. A diabolical masterpiece that no Wii U should go without."
Edge Magazine,100,"Sega's loss is Nintendo's gain: Bayonetta, twirling away from a gigantic demon's maw and smacking the highest choir of angels on the nose, has just given Wii U its first true classic. [Nov 2014, p.100]"
GameTrailers,98,"From its peerless combat to its outlandishly entertaining world, Bayonetta 2 is a triumph. Platinum Games has created a classic so thoroughly excellent that it can\t be ignored. Action games don\t get better than this."
LevelUp,96,"The glorious return of Kamiya's beloved brainchild, Bayonetta 2 is a master lesson in arcade action, flow, design and skill, even if it doesn't burn with the same passion of its predecessor."
Riot Pixels,95,"Bayonetta 2 is nothing less than the best game in its genre, and it\s a solid reason to buy a Wii U."
3DJuegos,95,"This is the game we were expecting, the one that gamers wanted. It's not so revolutionary as the first title, but it improves the gameplay lessons with a big personality."
EGM,95,"Filled with amazingly tuned combat, countless larger-than-life moments, copious amounts of legitimately challenging boss battles, interesting locations, lovable characters, and one of gaming\s most unforgettable heroines, Bayonetta 2 retains the crown as the standard for which all other stylish action games should strive to achieve."
Gaming Nexus,95,"Bayonetta 2 is a smashing success, and proves that the WiiU can be the home of some great core titles."
Multiplayer.it,95,"Bayonetta 2's only ""flaw"" is the very similar gameplay compared to the first chapter, but it's still a wonderful and engaging action game with tons of extras, replayability, online co-op and inspired graphics. Definitely one of the best games one can buy on Nintendo Wii U."
IGN,95,"This sequel builds on everything that made the original great, and delivers one of the most satisfying action games I've played."
Official Nintendo Magazine UK,93,"Not quite the landmark the original game was, but a thrillingly absurd, deep and beautiful brawler. Soul-bursting sorcery for devotees of the combo. [Christmas 2014, p.86]"
Everyeye.it,93,"It's action game J-style at its best, smooth to control, wonderful and crazy to watch. If you are even remotely interested in the genre, this is by far the best reason to own a WiiU as of today."
Power Unlimited,92,This is the best character action game out right now. Go get this videogame if you like character action games.
Cheat Code Central,92,"It's absolutely a pure Bayonetta game, it's an absolute blast to play, and it absolutely belongs on Nintendo's growing roster of excellently crafted games for the Wii U."
Games Master UK,91,"More of the same peerless action mechanics, barmy spectacle and wonderful depth. [Dec 2014, p.60]"
Gamestyle,90,Bayonetta 2 is an outright fantastic game. It\s another very good reason to own a Wii U and it outclasses practically every other game of this type by a considerable margin.
CD-Action,90,"I had a lot of questions in my head when I launched Bayonetta 2 for the first time. Is it possible to design a combat system as awesome as before, make it familiar, but not hackneyed? Is it possible to outshine the closing moments of the first game? The sequel needed just a couple of minutes to dispel all my concerns. [Dec 2014, p.62]"
Digital Trends,90,"Bayonetta 2 is a game whose gargantuan barrage of sex, violence, and surrealism sets the mind on fire in the best possible way."
NZGamer,90,"Bayonetta 2 is bigger, faster, crazier, and prettier than the original, and is very much deserving of your time."
ZTGD,90,"Bayonetta 2 is more than just a good action game, it is a fantastic addition to the already stellar Wii U lineup, and yet another reason to own the console."
ActionTrip,90,"Bayonetta 2 is one of the best action games of this generation, and close to one of the best overall."
Gameplanet,90,Bayonetta 2 is a silky smooth and highly-entertaining brawler that all Wii U owners should have in their collections.
Gamer.no,90,"Bayonetta 2 is an exhausting, but incredibly fun game that through it's fantastic combat system will both challenge and reward you in equal amounts."
Pelit (Finland),90,"Bayonetta 2 is not quite as good as the first Bayonetta, but that being said, the sequel is still a really terrific action game. [Oct 2014]"
Slant Magazine,90,"The campy hypersexuality feels joyful, rather than oppressive, because the character's overdetermined gender presentation is an expression of her power rather than a contrast to it."
Gamer.nl,90,"We would not call Bayonetta 2 revolutionary, but it is just as satisfying as the first one. The presentation is still a 'love it or hate it'-thing, but the refined gameplay is something not to miss, especially when you are a fan of the genre."
JeuxActu,90,"Even though the game is technically perfectible, the fact that Bayonetta 2 is the best beat'em up game currently on sale shouldn't give you any doubts on weather to buy it or not. True question is this: is it worth buying a Wii U just for this game? Oh yeah it is."
Telegraph,90,"It is a suitably bonkers introduction and wastes no time getting to the nub of the game: that glorious combat. It hasn\t lost any of its shine. A system of extraordinary layers, the combat begins as a thing of simplicity with buttons for punch, kick, shoot and dodge. It then unfurls itself as you play, teaching through action."
The Escapist,90,"Bayonetta 2 may be nonsensical, tacky, and visually anarchic, but its got some of the finest combat an action game could offer. It's packed with style, looks magnificent, and is as elegant as spectacle fighter as you could hope for."
GameOver.gr,90,"Sexy, breathtaking, lighting fast, beautiful. If you loved the first one, hurry up and get this one too."
games(TM),90,"A near-perfect action game, then, and a irrefutable reason to own a Wii U."
USgamer,90,"Bayonetta 2 is the high-flying return of everyone's favorite Umbra Witch. Platinum Games pushes to the Wii U to its limit with fast action, magnificent vistas, and huge bosses. The addition of the original Bayonetta just pushes the entire package over the top. If you're a Devil May Cry fan, this is a must-buy."
SpazioGames,90,"Calling it \crazy\ is not nearly enough. This game redefines action games, by taking everything to the next level. It's pure adrenaline, and its amazing combat system has yet to be reached. Its only fault lies in the excess of gigantic bosses, where the mechanics don't feel as perfect. If you love the action genre get this game. It's an order."
Eurogamer Portugal,90,"Bayonetta 2 does not have the impact the original and fails to overcome it, but there are valuable additions like the cooperative mode."
IGN Italia,90,"Despite not being as fresh and surprising as the original (which probably remains a better game overall), Bayonetta 2 is a heavenly triumph of excess: not only a sublime action game, but also a true killer application. Simply put, do not miss this one hell of a ride."
Digital Chumps,90,"Bayonetta 2 expresses a meticulous devotion to excessive elaborateness of style and action. It's a calculated brawler that not only minds its rules with painstaking diligence, but trusts its operator with how to best interpret them. The delicate engineering of merciless destruction has long been Platinum Games' modus operandi, and Bayonetta 2 is the purest and most potent declaration of their intentions."
Nintendo Life,90,"Bayonetta is is a must buy for any action gaming fans. It's fast, intense and ridiculous, all with an entertaining story and a protagonist that is forever subverting and playing with her audience. It's pure Platinum Games, too, which means it'll likely be adored by its converts and ignored by too many...Brilliant, brash and impossible to ignore."
NintendoWorldReport,90,"One of the best games to ever grace the Wii U. The sequel feels tighter, less obnoxious, and is a blast to play through. While the Wii U GamePad is not used in any significant way, and Tag Climax could have benefited from local co-op, this is the action-packed Bayonetta follow\up that I wanted."
Critical Hit,90,"Bayonetta 2 is something new blended with something familiar, improved in every way possible. Few other games can top it for sheer audacity and ballsiness, and if this is the last time we\ll ever see the leggy witch, then she\s going out with one hell of a bang."
VideoGamer,90,"A system seller. It's a Nintendo-published game that is rarely seen, and a game that will legitimately make non-Wii U owners jealous. It's everything I want from a hardcore Nintendo title, offering genre-leading combat and eye-popping visual spectacle."
Game Informer,90,"Fluid and satisfying combat remains the centerpiece of the experience. No matter what you do, Bayonetta 2 makes you look and feel awesome while doing it."
Eurogamer,90,"Bayonetta 2's biggest disappointment may be that it's an iterative sequel, but it's not such a problem when it's iterating on genius."
Metro GameCentral,90,"A fantastic sequel, whose improvements may be relatively subtle but are more than enough to confirm Bayonetta 2 as one of the greatest action games ever made."
Eurogamer Italy,90,"Bayonetta 2 is simply awesome. Platinum Games has done a great job improving their previous game, adding small details and creating a gorgeous looking new adventure for the sexy-witch. If you love action games, you can't miss this perfect cocktail of fun gameplay, great graphics and over-the-top humor."
COGconnected,88,"Bayonetta 2 is a solid game. It utilizes a simple yet interesting combo system, the visuals are gorgeous as they highlight your attacks and the enemies you battle, and the music and sound effects are top notch too. Although gameplay can be repetitive it still can be fun."
4Players.de,88,Visually and technically the Umbra witch showcases what Wii U can do. And even though you won\t get wowed as much as in the first bewitched action let me assure you: This is still one hell of a ride and easily one of the best action games of this year.
GamesBeat,87,"The narrative is a bunch of cliches that had me checking my phone and skipping cutscenes. It\s not all bad. The characters are mostly interesting, and the presentation is well done. I also like that it takes place Christmas time. But that stuff isn\t enough to make up for another lackluster gaming story. It\s a bummer because Bayonetta is so cool, and she deserves the chance to shine in something better."
Kill Screen,86,"Bayonetta 2 erects some of the most solid fighting mechanics and phantasmagorically gonzo visuals in gaming to date\certainly, something as compulsive and massive as this boosts the Wii U to the front of the pack\and through its formal choices communicates a singular, unfiltered vision of sexualization."
GamingTrend,85,"Bayonetta 2 is a worthy sequel, filled with ridiculously over-the-top action sequences and a combat system par excellence. Just don\t come for the story."
XGN,85,"Even though Bayonetta 2 is very much like the first one in the franchise, it is lovely to hack and slash around with the oversexualised Cereza. The animal transformations of the witch are awesome and it is a very solid game for hours of fun."
Game World Navigator Magazine,83,"Not even Bayonetta can last forever. First few levels of the sequel are fantastic, but afterwards it\s all about \floating platforms in space\ and \featureless corridors\. Nothing here is as innovative or as provocative as the original Bayonetta. It\s still a solid action, mind you. But we hope that third installation will find some other publisher than Nintendo. [Dec 2014, p.80]"
Level7.nu,80,"Bayonetta 2 contains, just like its predecessor, too much oldfashioned sexism. It's a pity because the intensity and variety inthis game is remarkable and all stages compete to be the most absurd.Perhaps the sequel is easier and hopefully that will attract moreplayers. If they're able to ignore the sexism, that is."
InsideGamer.nl,80,"Bayonetta 2 is not subtle and has too many cutscenes. But, the fighting is a lot more straightforward than in other hack and slashers and the flawless design plus the amazing detail convince us that Bayonetta 2 is an excellent game in its genre."
Shacknews,80,"Bayonetta 2 is manic, adrenaline-fueled combat at its best, showing tremendous depth beyond its shallow lead character."
Digital Spy,80,"It's a frantic game packed with stunning set-pieces, thrilling boss battles and a fantastic combat system, even if it doesn't deviate too far from the original."
Gamereactor Sweden,80,Beautiful destruction.
GamesRadar+,80,"More of the same is absolutely fine, as Bayonetta delivers her trademark action in true style. This sequel takes too long to get going and can feel harshly unfair, but when it's at its peak, the action is breathtaking."
Post Arcade (National Post),75,"Something much more tame, a word that should be the antithesis of the series...Game developers won\t fix what isn\t broken and to do so is taking a huge risk, but Bayonetta is a series of firsts and this game feels like it\s playing on repeat."
Polygon,75,"I won't guess why the blatant over-sexualization is still there, often more intensely than before. But it causes an otherwise great game to require a much bigger mental compromise to enjoy."
Game Revolution,70,"While I didn\t spend much time in this mode, I did come to laugh more and more at Bayonetta\s awkward animations and slightly less-than-believable narrative shifts."
LEVEL (Czech Republic),60,"Over the top yet unimaginative. At least the fights are dynamic and the game itself can be a breath of fresh air, considering what else is available on the Wii U. [Issue#245]"
