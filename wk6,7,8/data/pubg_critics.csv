"IBTimes UK","100","The enormity of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds' success will have surprised even its developers. This is a shooter that didn't invent the Battle Royale genre in gaming, but which certainly perfected it to the point that it found a massive, massive audience. With more than 30 million copies sold, PUBG is a bona fide phenomenon with an influence that will be felt in the industry for years to come."
"FANDOM","100","PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds is one of the most compelling video game experiences to come out in years. That its stood out in a year filled with some of the best games ever is a testament to how brilliant it really is. It’s the sort of game I talk about in excited, quick bursts with friends, the kind I think about when I’m not playing it."
"Polygon","100","Battlegrounds is the refinement of a new language of play, but what may earn it a spot in the video game canon is that conceptual efficiency. It isn’t accessible for every player, but it’s understandable. Anybody can easily learn to read this game, to watch it, to spot the tension and excitement and drama...[An] imperfectly perfect game."
"Metro Montreal","95","The fact that PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds impacted the industry in such an important way, even with its many flaws, is a testament to the strength of its game design. It’s a brilliant multiplayer shooter, a game that’s incredibly fun to play and almost as fun to watch."
"IGN","95","PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds has taken the military-sim gameplay popularized by games like ARMA and DayZ, boiled it down to its most exciting parts, and streamlined it into quick and accessible rounds of pure, hassle-free, survival-based action. Even though each game starts the same way, its remarkable ability to feel like a new, tense adventure each and every round has kept me coming back for hours on end."
"App Trigger","95","PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds is the most immersive, intense, adrenaline-pumping, winner-take-all shooter of its time. Ushering forth a new era of Battle Royale gameplay, its technical qualms are the only thing standing in the way of the path to near perfection in its gunplay and survival-first gameplay."
"InsideGamer.nl","95","PlayerUnknowns Battlegrounds is the new standard for the Battle Royale genre. It is not a polished game, but that does not really matter when you consider how much fun you are going to have with it."
"Game Informer","95","PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds brings the battle royale genre to a smashing mainstream success, packed with memorable moments and action-packed adventures. Solo or with friends, you’re in for an intense ride that’s different every single time."
"Games.cz","90","The whole madness around PUBG is well-deserved. This is the best possible praise for this great battle-royale-genre shooter. What a pity there are so many bugs, mad vehicle physics and occasional cheaters, but it bothers you only for a while. When you frantically get into the hectic, slightly frightening struggle for life and death you’ll forget anything else."
"CD-Action","90","PUBG’s version 1.0 not only brings a new map, but primarily introduces numerous crucial gameplay improvements to a game which was already hard to resist. [02/2018, p.28]"
"games(TM)","90","PUBG lives up to its monstrously large reputation. [Issue#197, p.74]"
"God is a Geek","90","A revelatory combination of the online PvP survival and competitive shooter genres, well deserving of being labelled as a phenomenon. As an added bonus, you don’t have to be pro gamer to enjoy some level of success online."
"Edge Magazine","90","What it does have is something an Activision or EA would kill for: a game built up around one good idea that drew in a community of unprecedented size. And that counts for a lot against PUBG's flaws: its rough-edged movement, animations, collision detection, character customisation, spectator functionality, and presentation. Perhaps you might hear all that and think this isn't worth your time. To do so would be to miss out on an absolute, and absolutely deserving, phenomenon. [March 2018, p.106]"
"Games Master UK","90","Intense, rough around the edges, and brilliant. Don't fear its popularity: embrace it, and enjoy. [Feb 2018, p.68]"
"IGN Spain","90","If it continues with the work done so far, and if we trust the promises that come to us from those responsible, the battlefields of PlayerUnknown can become, without a doubt, the most important games and records of this decade."
"Meristation","90","A unique and exciting multiplayer experience in which every run is different from the next."
"PCGamesN","90","PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds is without a doubt one of the best and most inventive multiplayer shooters of all time, and its persistent flaws have done nothing to detract from that, or its popularity. Perhaps it is not the first of its kind, but it is the purest distillation of what battle royale games are about: self-preservation by any means. And that, as 26 million people have now discovered, is endlessly appealing."
"Metro GameCentral","90","PUBG is one of the best multiplayer experiences of the generation, and this is the best version of it so far – even if it’s still a work in progress."
"3DJuegos","90","One of the most influential multiplayer games of the decade. Addictive and accessible, turns the battle royale concept into a trend in the videogame industry. Two huge maps, more than 30 weapons, 99 losers and only one winner."
"Gamersky","86","Along with the publishing of the 1.0 version, we also get a new desert map, a very practical playback function and many other updates. The completion of PUBG is now better than ever. However, the connection quality is still bad at times, and the cheaters are still everywhere in this game. PUBG has a long distance to go before it can be praised as perfect."
"PC Gamer","85","PUBG takes the tradition of big-map survival games like DayZ and compresses it into digestible, 3-to-30-minute sprints that are reliably scary and low-key."
"PlayGround.ru","85","Despite having some bugs, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds offers a truly unique and diverse gaming experience."
"Gamer.nl","85","PUBG is exactly what the hype says. Its exciting, its filled with explosions and the easy rules make you come back for more. Too bad it is so buggy."
"Vandal","84","PUBG has managed to create experiences you can't find anywhere else (or at least, you couldn't). It needs to improve some aspects and polish some things to become a legend, but the foundations are already very, very good."
"New Game Network","83","Some technical hiccups aside, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds can provide some of the most intense and exciting moments multiplayer gaming has to offer thanks to a clever game mode that supports varied play-styles, and provides a unique self-contained adventure every round."
"Easy Allies","80","What really makes PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds work is the fact that anyone can jump in and walk away with stories to tell. There are so many different ways to approach the game, and in every round, you’re starting on a level playing field where all that separates players are skill and experience. Having a committed friend or two can offer memorable moments to bond over and alleviate some of the more mundane periods. For players looking for more immediate engagement the deliberate pace of each match might be a turn off. Despite a simple premise and only two maps, PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds manages to be unpredictable every time you jump out of that cargo plane, for better or worse."
"Cubed3","80","PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds is not a perfect game, but there is a good reason why it has become one of the most popular, and discussed titles of 2017. A great synthesis of mechanics, map design, and emergent gameplay, as well as a successful reiteration of the groundwork built by previous games, mean that PUBG is a fantastic experience, when it's working as intended."
"4Players.de","80","This game is a phenomenon. Not only because of its success. But rather that this Battle Royale is so fascinating even though it has significant flaws. It is the situational suspense, the half hour of sizzling tension that makes players come back again and again."
"The Games Machine","80","For the time being, Playerunknown's Battlegrounds won - pun intended - the battle royale of battle royales. This new ""gold rush"" spawned a good number of decent titles, but the one created by Brendan Greene if by far the best and funniest to play (even if there's still room for improvement)."
"TheSixthAxis","80","The Battle Royale game mode is so compelling, with each loss only making you want to do better next time, and each victory giving you stories of tense games of cat and mouse and frantic gunfights. It’s still lacking in terms of polish and optimisation, but after years of experimentation, this feels like the real start of a new paradigm in multiplayer gaming."
"Twinfinite","80","One thing is for sure, as we look to the future for this powerhouse of a game, the sky is the limit."
"Gameblog.fr","80","PUBG is a like an adrenaline shot. It is surely one of the best multiplayer experiences in recent years. With its simple and highly effective principle, it has been the best Battle Royale game and one of the most fun games of 2017. And will probably be so in 2018 as well."
"Multiplayer.it","80","PUBG is pubg is the best choice if you want to experience the feeling of being the last man standing."
"GameSpot","80","Whether you play solo or in a group, successfully executing adaptive tactics to win intense, high-stakes firefights makes for an incredibly rewarding experience. Every player has unique stories of their most memorable matches, and even after hundreds of hours, PUBG continues to inspire rousing tales of victory and defeat."
"USgamer","80","PUBG is such a pure and fun experience that it overcomes its many flaws. There are glitches, there are crashes, there is jank. The game will probably never be fully done. But parachuting down onto that island feels new and exciting every time. A number of simple ideas comes together to make a great game and establish a great genre."
"Gamer.no","80","Playerunknown's Battlegrounds is ultimately greatly entertaining, and offers adrenaline filled action of the best kind. Sure, the performance is still not perfect, and the developer need to work more on that, but seen as a whole the experience is fantastic."
"Windows Central","80","If you want to be the last man (or woman) standing and wish to play a game closely resembling Battle Royale and The Hunger Games, you'll be hard pressed to find a better game than PUBG, for now."
"GameStar","77","Is the game a flop? Absolutely not. PUBG inspires me - even in its current state. There are only a few games in which I am so energized from the first to the last minute of a match. Playing a round with friends and then doing well leads to a fantastic feeling. Quite subjectively, PUBG is a great game. But objectively there is still a lot it's gotten wrong."
"GRYOnline.pl","75","Playerunknown's Battlegrounds is a superb example of adapting the battle royale gameplay model. This is a true phenomenon and an event of the year but it's far too soon to call it ""game of the year"". PUBG is more of a late early access - tons of things got better over time but that's only the beginning."
"DualShockers","75","In the same way that Counter-Strike‘s early days led to it dominating the competitive scene and Minecraft‘s years of beta access led to it becoming a game that defined a generation, PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds isn’t necessarily the first “battle royale” game out there, but it is the one that’s leading the charge on making players fight to survive, and it’s thrilling in every way."
"Everyeye.it","75","The exit from Early Access, then, seemed a bit too hasty: without going into the merits of the number of maps available, in terms of visual cleanliness, optimization and quality of the interface there is still much to improve. In short, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds works well, but it's a modest game...But remember that between phenomena and masterpiece, there is often an abysmal difference."
"Merlin'in Kazanı (Turkey)","71","PUBG is the clear choice for the Battle Royale era. However, for players who are not satisfied with the game should wait for the future updates."
"GameCritics","70","Despite how many technical and design issues it has now, and regardless of however irrelevant it may be in a few years, PUBG is revelatory, and will always hold a special place in my heart."
"Eurogamer Italy","70","PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds did not invent the battle royale genre but is the game that exploits it better than anyone else. With 30 millions players and after becoming a phenomenon on Twich, it's one of the biggest surprises of 2017 but is still far from being considered a masterpiece."
"Atomix","70","A fun game that's lacking new ideas."
"Game Revolution","70","I have faith that with such a large following (and cash flow) the PUBG team will eventually get things squared away, but for now, this game still feels like it's in early access. However, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds is an absolute blast to play and has a broad appeal that few other games can match. As long as you temper your expectations (and make sure you have a decent PC), then this is one of the top games of 2017 to check out."
