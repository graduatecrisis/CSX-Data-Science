It's a fantastic game that proves what the medium can do when used correctly, and provides an experience that can't be replicated by film or literature."
"The Jimquisition","100","Describing Inside is difficult, not because one can’t find the words, but because it has to be seen to truly be believed."
"Digital Spy","100","It's rare that a game can be beautiful, gruesome, tense and exhilarating all at the same time, but Inside does just that. Its six years in the making really show.

Its only downside is that it's quite short, but while it lasts, it's absolutely glorious."
"Giant Bomb","100","Inside expands on the concepts and scope of its predecessor in wildly creative ways, and it's so immaculately designed and constructed from top to bottom that it almost feels suitable for display in an art museum. This is one hell of a followup."
"IGN","100","Inside very clearly builds upon what made Limbo great, and in fact builds something greater. Its unimaginable twist may leave you dumbfounded, confused, and quite possibly speechless, but it will fuel heated discussion with your friends about its meaning, its message, and its intentions."

"Meristation","95","Quotation forthcoming."
"Critical Hit","95","Inside is a game that simply has to be experienced.

"Digital Chumps","92","Inside's quiet confidence is a maneuver invented to not only disarm the player, but also destabilize assumptions that seem inseparable from an entire class of games. Plenty of games have pulled the curtain away to thunderous applause. Only Inside has room for shock, panic, and the inconceivable notion that the nightmare isn't yet over."
"IGN Italia","92","Playdead's Inside is a strange, freaky and compelling game. With stunning visuals and a graceful control scheme, it's a perfect, small, indie game."
"Gaming Age","91","Basically, what I'm trying to say is that Inside excels in pretty much every way imaginable."
"Worth Playing","90","Inside shows that Playdead has a knack for the short but powerful puzzle-platformer. The puzzles are logical and challenging, while the story is told well without a reliance on the usual things like dialogue and cut scenes. The balance between both creates a game that has a ton of memorable moments, and the flow is smooth enough that you're compelled to keep playing until you reach the thought-provoking ending. With a presentation that adds greatly to the narrative, Inside is well worth your time."
"Edge Magazine","90","Inside may require thought, care and occasionally a sharp sense of timing to progress, but its obstacles never feel unfair. [Issue#296, p.120]"
"The Digital Fix","90","Dark, sombre and thoughtful, Inside is a brief experience that's satisfying in the questions it creates."
"Official Xbox Magazine UK","90","We expected a brief, morbid adventure, but we never expected it to surpass Limbo. [Sept 2016, p.80]"
"games(TM)","90","Inside is a rarity, both in terms of its ambitions and its construction."
"InsideGamer.nl","90","Inside is a short but amazing trip through a broken world. It offers not only entertaining and logical puzzles, but also a story that is as tragic as it is bizarre. The fluent animations are the cherries on top of this tasty platform cake."
"Forbes","90","Inside is an incredible game, a compelling artistic achievement that deserves your time no matter what genre of game you normally prefer. I [wish] there was a tiny bit more to it, but between the gameplay, the animation and the atmosphere, it’s enough to be a worthwhile experience, and one you won’t forget for a good long time to come."
"TheSixthAxis","90","Inside is not for those looking for hours of fun, opting instead to channel the ‘games as art’ mentality that has been debated into the dirt. It’s a game that people will be trying to figure out the meaning to for months to come."
"Twinfinite","90","As phenomenal of an experience as Limbo was, Playdead somehow managed to top it with Inside. It’s a hauntingly beautiful game, especially for how violent and dark it turns by the end. The mechanics, while simple, really cause you to stop and think how all the elements of a puzzle should work together. Although it’s a rather short experience, Inside will undoubtedly keep you thinking hours after you’ve seen the credits roll. You’ll definitely be pondering the implications of what happened, and it’ll make you eager to replay it in case you might have missed anything."
"GameSpew","90","As a piece of commerce, it is incredibly brief and depending on how you value one over the other, when you decide to experience this masterpiece is up to you. However, make no mistake, Inside is a game I recommend that everyone play."
"GamingTrend","90","Inside is an incredible sophomore swing from Playdead, as the atmosphere, aesthetic and gameplay meld into one glorious experience that demands attention. Don’t read about it, don’t seek more, don’t ask questions — just clear your afternoon schedule and experience it."
"Yahoo!","90","Inside is an artistic triumph. Video games, at their best, fold their various components into a whole that is far greater than the sum of their parts. Inside does exactly that, and more so does exactly what its name implies: it gets in your head, in your system, and stays there."
"JeuxActu","90","After LIMBO, INSIDE is another masterpiece from Playdead. Maybe not that innovative with its gameplay, this new game is above all a great performance when it comes to setting an atmosphere and telling a story without saying a word. And, yes, it's beautiful."
"4Players.de","90","It is definitely one of the most intense gaming experiences I was lucky enough to play in the last few years. With simplicity and atmosphere at its core, it took me on an emotional journey with an intensity and ruthlessness I didn’t expect."
"Game Rant","90","Inside builds on every strength of Playdead’s Limbo, while also delivering a compelling yet haunting world filled with smart puzzles and inventive mechanics."
"IGN Spain","90","A minimalistic yet excellent puzzle-platformer that achieves everything that it attempts almost perfectly. Only its slower pace and the lack of a real challenge could be improved."
"Hobby Consolas","90","Masterpiece? Whatever you call it, it's a game that will blow your mind. And that's totally worth the ride."
"Post Arcade (National Post)","90","I can imagine some players being disappointed that Inside is perhaps a bit too much like Limbo. From both games’ dark themes and imagery to the sorts of puzzles they offer up, there are plenty of lines to be drawn between them."
"IBTimes UK","90","It's an astonishing conclusion as haunting and evocative as anything you'll see in a game this year."
"SpazioGames","90","INSIDE is a top quality product that will let you enjoy a great journey, as amazing as overwhelming, where the excellent visual language drawn by Playdead is the key feature making the story absolutely special. INSIDE is the umpteenth piece of proof that an actually ""different"" game can be crafted with simple and functional ideas, with neither cut-scenes misuse nor fancy narrative techniques. Even the poor longevity get overshadowed: INSIDE offers an experience that only asks to be lived, not for the quantity but for the high quality of its content."
"DarkStation","90","Inside takes an already great formula of and improves on it in just about every way. The beautifully designed environments coupled with the cleverly crafted puzzles easily makes this the indie game to beat this year."
"M3","90","Inside is not only one of the best indie games in a long time, it might as well be the best game of 2016, so far. With beautiful design and an interesting story, Playdead manages to deliver a platform adventure that won't leave anyone untouched."
"GamesRadar+","90","Whether or not it achieves the same touchstone status as Limbo, Inside is a spellbinding, haunting experience  - one I don't intend to relive any time soon, but absolutely recommend."
"Hardcore Gamer","90","Inside isn’t just some incremental improvement over the basic premise of Limbo, it’s one of the best puzzle-platformers ever made. From its brilliant puzzle design, which finds a way to balance constant progress and momentum with puzzles that require deep thought, to its gorgeous lighting effects, this is the type of game that demonstrates why the indie development scene is something special."
"XGN","90","Inside is one of the best games of this year so far. The puzzles are fantastic and overall it's a very addictive game."
"Game Revolution","90","Although not the breakthrough that was Limboback in 2010, Inside is nonetheless a beautifully-crafted refinement of that experience."
"Kill Screen","88","Playdead’s greatest feat in creating Inside was making it look like they never created it in the first place."
"GamePro Germany","86","Inside is a enormously atmospheric platformer with puzzles, with a great graphical style, and it's thrilling until the end."
"CGMagazine","85","If you even remotely enjoyed Limbo, you'll feel right at home with Inside."
"COGconnected","85","Ultimately, if you enjoy dark games with a healthy dose of problem-solving and/or you enjoyed Limbo, then you’ll definitely enjoy Inside as well!"
"Vandal","85","Inside is the perfect evolution of Limbo. An unforgettable journey worth your time."
"GameCritics","85","Its vividly depressing, yet wondrous world proves that Playdead is still the master of atmospheric side-scrolling platformers, and it quickly became one of the best games I’ve played this year."
"Multiplayer.it","85","Inside recounts the journey of a young boy in a dark, mysterious and aesthetically significant gaming world. It’s an excellent puzzle platformer, able to convey emotions like fear and doubt, and it stimulates the player’s observation."
"IGN Denmark","85","Set an evening aside where you immerse yourself in this living painting, and enjoy every single detail."
"God is a Geek","85","While it doesn't stray far from the template Limbo set, Inside is a gorgeous, beautifully directed puzzle platformer that you'll want to see through to the end."
"NZGamer","80","Fun, easy, creepy, scary, bizarre, and oozing with atmosphere, but doesn’t quite stick the landing."
"Eurogamer Poland","80","Inside is short but immensely interesting, telling its story almost like a silent movie, without words. Playday has once again managed to create something unique, a game that stays with us for hours after finishing the story."
"Power Unlimited","80","Inside is an easy recommendation if you loved Limbo, but the abrupt ending is a bit of a bummer."
"Metro GameCentral","80","Visually though this is one of the most impressive games of the year, with the subtle animation and sparing use of colour telling you all you need to know about the situation without a word of dialogue. Inside isn’t a fun video game, but it is a clever and intelligent one. And despite how long it’s been since Limbo it’s telling that nobody has managed to perfect that formula as well as Playdead."
"Stevivor","80","Playdead has greatly improved how it delivers a story, but hasn’t moved away from ambiguity. The latter three-quarters of Inside cheapens the otherwise refined package, only saved because the studio is the undisputed master of horrific puzzles. Ending aside, it’s definitely worth a look."
"Eurogamer Italy","80","Compared to Limbo, Inside does not propose any innovations and does not evolve the gameplay in any way. The new Playdead game, however, is a fascinating adventure to play, with bated breath, from start to finish thanks to the wonderful setting full of mystery."
"GameSpot","80","This is a beautiful, haunting, and memorable game, a worthy follow-up to Limbo. Its puzzles, although rarely difficult, are engaging complements to the story. The real achievement of this game, though, is the way that it crafts its narrative: detailed environments convey the bizarre world that you travel through; introspective moments are filled with minimalist sound design and just the barest touches of music; and the things you must do to complete your journey force you to confront the realities of humanity, freedom, and existence."
"Attack of the Fanboy","80","A great game from start to finish. Fans of indie titles, moody atmosphere, and/or puzzle platformers should grab Inside ASAP."
"AusGamers","75","At some point you get the feeling Playdead maybe didn’t know how to solve their own mystery and the game wraps up in a messy, unusual and unsatisfying way."
"Gamer.nl","75","Inside, from the makers of Limbo, is just like its predecessor - truly amazing to explore. The beautiful atmosphere and the intriguing themes are interesting, even though the game is fairly short and does not succeed in being very challenging."
