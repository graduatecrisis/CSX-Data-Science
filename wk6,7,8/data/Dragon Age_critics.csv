"Digitally Downloaded","100","BioWare achieved everything that it needed to with Dragon Age: Inquisition. It revitalised a series that had suffered real brand damage in Dragon Age II, and easily stands as the best RPG we've seen in years. There is absolutely no reason to miss out on this one."
"Game Revolution","100","For a fantasy game presenting dozens of hours of gameplay, Dragon Age: Inquisition largely delivers on its promises, both mechanically and in gameplay that fans will want from the third title in the series."
"ZTGD","100","Dragon Age: Inquisition is an amazing game. There really is something special about it. I know a lot of people were down on Dragon Age II, but this game redeems every issue you may have had with the last game."
"Joystiq","100","It's a gorgeous game on an epic scale. Rich in character and story, it creates a fantasy world with plausible social rules you can get lost in. It makes you feel that you aren't just exploring a new world, but helping shape it at various levels of society. Inquisition sets the bar for what a blockbuster RPG should be."
"Digital Chumps","98","Dragon Age: Inquisition has incredibly deep and complex parts, while still maintaining the core gameplay values that Bioware knows how to do best with their third-person action titles. The game delivers everything promised, including gorgeous visuals and a strong story. Simply put, Bioware has returned the Dragon Age series to the greatness it truly deserves."
"Impulsegamer","96","Dragon Age Inquisition is a must play RPG on the PS4 that successfully takes the best out of both previous games to create sword and sorcery perfection."

"Post Arcade (National Post)","95","BioWare’s about to drop its mic and walk off stage...It is a paragon of multiple-path storytelling and character development. It offers a master class in intricate, customizable, multi-hero combat. And it delivers not one but ten beautiful and expansive open worlds to explore, boldly throwing down the gauntlet to rival developers."
"Game Informer","95","With a mixture of open-world exploration, entertaining combat, and top-tier characters, the team at BioWare has found a winning formula that isn’t shackled to either Dragon Age: Origins or Dragon Age II. Inquisition is not defined by the traditions it returns to, but by the new directions it forges for this magnificent fantasy universe."
"Polygon","95","Dragon Age: Inquisition puts the fate of the world in your hands in a way that few role-playing games have done before. And even after another 80 hours devoted to it, it's a world I cannot wait to return to in whatever BioWare does next. I don't know what higher praise I could give."
"Merlin'in Kazanı (Turkey)","92","If you think Bioware messed up with Dragon Age 2 and Mass Effect 3, Dragon Age: Inquisition will be your cure. Hold your breath, behold the great gaming atmosphere. Dragon Age: Inquisition brings you back to the series origins. It's one of 2014's most successful games with an impressive fighting system."
"Level7.nu","90","Despite a questionable predecessor and a somewhat rushed release intime for Christmas, Bioware has managed to create a fantasticadventure that easily ranks among the best games of the year.

"RPGamer","90","Dragon Age: Inquisition starts off as a good game and keeps getting better as it goes along. This doesn't mean the early parts are insufferable, but instead shows how the game continues to build and develop throughout its entirety."
"USgamer","90","Dragon Age: Inquisition is a graphical showcase for the next-generation consoles—a sprawling, beautiful open-world RPG with a deeply satisfying exploration loop and just enough in the way of mechanical depth to keep hardcore adventurers happy."
"Shacknews","90","With a huge, breathtaking world, an epic story, and choices that leaves a significant mark on the world around you, Dragon Age: Inquisition embodies everything that makes the series so popular."
"Gaming Nexus","90","If you are looking for a time sink of an RPG with a strong sense of setting and character, then look no further, because Dragon Age: Inquisition is a Game of the Year candidate."
"GameSpot","90","Dragon Age: Inquisition is a wonderful game and a lengthy pilgrimage to a magical world with vital thematic ties to one we already know."
"Pelit (Finland)","89","Dragon Age: Inquisition returns the franchise to right path after disappointing second installation. Its massive world combined to leading the ever growing Inquisition makes the game really addictive. Plot could be more coherent, but after 40 hours I still crave to search every inch of the world."
"IGN Italia","88","Exciting, very detailed in every area, full of brilliant dialogues, characters and things to do including crafting, remote missions, exploration and a very well balanced leveling. Add great visuals and you'll have the best episode of the series so far."
"IGN","88","It’s a surprisingly huge, dense world, and I soon realized there were still entire sandboxes I hadn’t even set foot in. Even in my hundredth hour, I’m still discovering."
"GamesBeat","87","Inquisition is a Schrodinger’s Goldilocks kind of a game: too big and just right at the same time...The main campaign is more interested in telling you how great you are than letting you prove it, and combat feels designed for a game half this size. It’s not a far fall from grace, by any means, but it’s noticeable — and occasionally grating — in such a long experience. But if you have been working for the Inquisition for that long, hopefully by then you will be too busy discovering and exploring to care that much."
"Games Master UK","86","Takes far too long to get going, but once it does you'll be hooked for the longest haul. [Jan 2015, p.64]"
"Playstation Official Magazine Australia","85","The Dragon Age game people who hate Dragon Age will like. [January 2015, p76]"
"Vandal","85","It is not a revolution, but it is one of the best RPGs we've seen in a while. Definitely, the best of its genre on the next generation of consoles."
"Worth Playing","85","Dragon Age: Inquisition is the biggest and best Dragon Age to date. Packed to the brim with content and carefully refined mechanics, it's sure to please any Dragon Age fan. It has a fair share of problems, but none detract too much from the strong core experience."
"Destructoid","85","Inquisition is a triumph and proves that despite some missteps along the way, BioWare hasn't lost its touch."
"Play UK","84","An exhaustive and impactful world let down by predictable aesthetics and combat. [Issue#251, p.70]"
"Playstation Official Magazine UK","80","A flawed almost-classic. [Jan 2015, p.84]"
"Slant Magazine","80","Once you've dipped into the game's heavily customizable odds and ends, and made decent strides in the core campaign, you'll soon realize just how much there is to do and see in Thedas and its many regions."
"JeuxActu","80","Dragon Age Inquisition is a solid RPG that should conquer any gamer's heart with its well-rounded gameplay. Definitely a big improvement over the last game in the IP."
"GamesRadar+","80","Dragon Age: Inquisition creates a massive, vibrant world on a scale far greater than its predecessors, and does an excellent job of making you feel in command. The heart of this game rests with its characters, who keep you invested in the action."
"VideoGamer","80","I’ve had a great time leading the Inquisition. It’s unusual to be able to look back at a game like this and have such fine memories, despite being so underwhelmed by its opening hours. For some, it may well feel like too much of a grind to begin with, and for time-poor players those 15 hours may be far too much of an investment."
"Digital Spy","80","It might be conventional as far as visuals and monsters go, but its overall appeal rests in its provision of a living world that can be sculpted and altered in ways both subtle and explicit. So long as you're prepared to put the required time in, Dragon Age: Inquisition has plenty to give."
"Cheat Code Central","76","Inquisition will most likely suffer the same fate as its predecessors. It’s a fun game that will probably never achieve a broad fan base, but there will be those that love the game and will go to great lengths to defend it with rabid aggression. All told, I was expecting more but I’m not really that surprised. I had fun and that’s what counts."
"Kill Screen","75","Inquisition feels slick but siloed. The story and exploration parts of the game are boxed separately, and the latter is full of prefab errands with few ties to the themes of the Dragon Age setting."
"Gamereactor Sweden","70","Lovely design and solid atmosphere but the gameplay feels clunky."
