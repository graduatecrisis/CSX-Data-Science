"Telegraph","100","There were no doubts that Doom would play fast, look stunning, or be gory; the surprise is that Doom is as relevant, smart and self-aware as it is; merging old ideas with new ones; injecting its near-flawless shooter mechanics into a campaign that’s impeccably refined, hilariously dumb and fiendishly moreish."
"Giant Bomb","100","It's hard to imagine a better Doom game in 2016 than this exhilarating, darkly witty new take on id's classic."
"GamesRadar+","100","Intelligent, involved, and relentlessly exhilarating, now, just as in '93, the most exciting FPS around is a game called Doom."
"IBTimes UK","100","Intelligent, fresh and endlessly enjoyable, Doom is more than a tribute to its beloved progenitor. Taken in its own right, this is the most finely crafted, technically impressive pure shooter in over a decade, proving that id Software, even after 26 years, is an adept, sophisticated game-maker. It may not create the same tectonic shift in video game culture as its ancestor, but personally, I prefer this Doom to the original. By refining, meticulously, several age-old and taken-for-granted game mechanics, Doom proves that excitement, spectacle and even narrative cohesion can exist in games seemingly composed of the basest elements."
"Brash Games","100","Overall I am completely satisfied with Doom. So far it has been my favourite third party AAA game of this console generation. I can’t remember being this impressed with a first person shooter since BioShock Infinite, and even then I think I prefer this one."
"Digital Chumps","96","DOOM is a masterful reboot of one of the most important and legendary franchises in the history of games; bravo to id and Bethesda."
"Power Unlimited","93","DOOM is a stupendously good package, filled with the best first person shooter action in recent history. DOOM is back ladies and gentlemen, and it is metal as all hell."
"IGN Italia","91","Doom is the best possible way to play, in 2016, something that was great in 1993. Unmissable."
"The Digital Fix","90","Exactly the right amount of old and new, DOOM is an adrenaline rush that borders on overwhelming in the best possible way."
"Edge Magazine","90","Doom's shimmering, bombastic combat is as absorbing as it is revelatory. [Aug 2016, p.100]"
"Playstation Official Magazine UK","90","An important, palate-cleansing release in a crowded genre, Doom is essential playing for anyone who registers as a shooter fan. Heed the call of the FPS daddy and get your ass to Mars, pronto.[July 2016, p.78]"
"GameOver.gr","90","DOOM is the incarnation of classical and vintage FPS gameplay with some really interesting twists that convey even more substance and flavor to the game. DOOM has an uncompromised technical performance and a high replayability value plus a frantic. It’s unfortunate that the old school multiplayer included feels like a lost opportunity. Nevertheless, the whole package pulses with energy and adrenaline. Try it on the higher difficulty settings and feel the wrath of Hell."
"Gameplanet","90","Despite a troubled development, Doom is a confident, cracking throwback that pays loving tribute to its much-vaunted forefathers while bringing the noise via cutting edge tech. In a world awash with sci-fi hitscan shooters, it's a breath of fiery air that will delight as it melts faces."
"Impulsegamer","90","Doom is back on next-gen consoles and it's definitely a worthy reboot in every sense!"
"Game Revolution","90","DOOM is hands-down one of the best reimagined and exciting FPS games this generation."
"Push Square","90","DOOM may become repetitious near the end and doesn't take needed risks with mission variety, but it boasts some of the finest shooting mechanics and thoughtful levels we've seen in a first-person shooter in years, pushing it to the very fringes of excellence. The campaign's a head-banging, heavy metal hoot with a surprisingly good backstory, striking visuals, and two decent multiplayer-minded modes to back it up."
"Playstation Universe","90","A confident resurgence of one of the FPS genre’s pioneering efforts; DOOM not only manages to boast perhaps the finest single-player campaign in the genre but also a blissfully entertaining multiplayer suite and map editor to boot. Make no mistake, this is DOOM 2.0 and it’s one of the very best shooters you can buy on PS4 right now."
"Atomix","90","After so many years, we finally have a new DOOM and it truly feels like a classic game with it's frenetic and addictive gameplay combat. Prepare to fight thousands of demons in planet Mars and hell like the old times. Fantastic accomplishment for id Sofwtare and Bethesda once again."
"God is a Geek","90","It may not be genre-defining like its progenitor but it’s easily the best shooter on the current crop of consoles and one of the finest first person shooters of recent years."
"Hobby Consolas","90","id Software teaches us a lesson on how to make a great FPS campaign looking at the roots of the genre but making it new and fresh with spectacular graphics at 1080p and 60fps and the new executions system. The multiplayer is bad, as you should probably have imagined, but Snapmap, the level editor, is absolutely great and will be providing great moments for months to come."
"The Jimquisition","90","With Doom, id has delivered a highly polished, utterly shameless Hellbound hecatomb that confidently swaggers into the world with gaudy fervor. It’s huge, it’s preposterous, and it’s absolutely bloody majestic."
"Critical Hit","90","DOOM is unrepentantly old school. It’s gore porn to the max, a ballet of bullets and blood that I can’t get enough of. Satisfyingly brutal, solid and most importantly, fun."
"USgamer","90","id Software has taken its original, no-BS Doom formula and very successfully repackaged it for the modern era. The result is a thrash metal loud, gloriously gory, blisteringly fast, and thoroughly entertaining oldschool shooter. Both the single-player and multiplayer modes are basically throwbacks to simpler times, but are wrapped up with contemporary trimmings to create a package that fans of the original Doom games should really enjoy."
"COGconnected","90","If you like first person shooters, if you’re an old DOOM fan, or if you just like killing demons, treat yourself to DOOM 2016."
"Eurogamer Italy","90","Old school gaming strikes back again, and its hits are as powerful as they once were."
"CGMagazine","90","Doom reminded me that games used to just be fun. It’s an polished and incredibly enjoyable game that blends old-school sensibilities with new-school quality. I appreciate a steak, but every now and again, all I want is a delicious, greasy burger. Doom is that burger."
"Game Informer","88","The campaign steals the show, performing at a level the other modes can't match. The straightforward competitive multiplayer recalls the glory days of arena shooters like Quake or Unreal, largely relying on the rush of circle strafing duels to keep players engaged. The standard fare of mode varieties and cosmetics-driven progression check off the boxes of a fully featured experience, but unlike the campaign, it feels generic."
"Everyeye.it","88","Exaggerated, violent, ruthless. Bethesda and id Software took the essence of the shooters you played in the 90s and rewrote it with a modern language. DOOM is an unstoppable FPS, with a bloodthirsty single player campaign and a solid Multiplayer, unfortunately showing some balancing problems."
"Cheat Code Central","86","I honestly think we're looking at a spring blockbuster and a truly worthy reboot of a timeless classic. DOOM isn't for everyone. The blinding speed of play, demonic symbolism, demanding controls, and hyper-violence may discourage some from jumping in. If you can handle it, though, it really is a thrill ride."
"PSX-Sense.nl","85","DOOM is an awesome return to form, not just for the franchise but also for the old school shooter genre. A triumph, held back only by lengthy loading times and a slight lack of depth in the single-player campaign. Not that these nitpicks matter when you're shooting demons left and right with a big grin on your face."
"ActionTrip","85","The multiplayer aside, the true appeal to the game remains in the single-player campaign, which is how it was and should be with a DOOM title."
"Polygon","85","Doom struggles somewhat to finish what it starts, and for a franchise that practically created what we understand as shooter multiplayer 22 years ago, its largely flavorless multiplayer is surprising. But on the whole, as a new interpretation of one of gaming's most formative, difficult to pin down cyphers, id has done a pretty great job in making something that feels familiar and fresh, and, most importantly, pretty damned fun."
"LaPS4","85","Doom is a '90s game made in 2016. It's campaign is, plain and simple, lots of fun, as long as you can keep up with its innumerable battle arenas and its gameplay mechanics, based on movement, pure speed and rhythm. Its multiplayer options lack work and don't depend as much on player skills, although the SnapMap mode leverages it, thanks to its almost infinite edition and creation options. This amounts to an all-around game, especially made for players that grew up with FPS games a long time ago."
"Kill Screen","85","It’s a game with confidence in the worth of revisiting its history and an earnest belief that doing so can result in much more than an empty exercise in nostalgia."
"GameCrate","85","With Doom, it’s clear that id Software set out to make a shooter game which puts fun above all else, and in that regard, the studio hit the nail right on the head. Some old-school purists may scoff at a Doom game with progression and unlocks and other modern shooter elements, but if their refusal to let go of the past keeps them from playing Doom, they’ll only be robbing themselves of the chance to play what is hands down one of the most solid shooter experiences of 2016 so far."
"Vandal","84","Doom is the perfect mix of the classic and the modern shooters. Fun, frenetic and wild, Doom delivers pure, old school action."
"Easy Allies","80","Doom honors its legacy while setting the stage for a new era for the long dormant franchise. Intimately gory encounters and a surprising emphasis on story more than make up for the bland multiplayer."
"Playstation Official Magazine Australia","80","Look past the lop-sided multiplayer, and Doom is still one helluva reboot. It’s a must for any modern FPS fan looking to taste the ultra-violence of yesteryear. Your Nana will hate it. [August 2016, p71]"
"LEVEL (Czech Republic)","80","Excellent return to the classics cannot deny its modernity at the same time. It attracts with brutality, entertains with endless action and surprises with very clever design. [Issue#264]"
"Worth Playing","80","Doom is a fantastic single-player experience bundled with a weak multiplayer component."
"GameCritics","80","By sticking to its core identity and cranking the intensity up, id has raised the bar on how I want action-oriented first-person shooters to feel, and it’s going to be hard to go back to something with less adrenaline after my time with this heavy metal beast."
"Gamer.nl","80","Doom is not the best shooter ever made, but boy did we enjoy it. Many references to the original, plus a lot of chaotic battle on locations that are simply insane. Doom is Doom, but in a modern way, and we thank id Software for that."
"Yahoo!","80","Kudos to id and Bethesda for managing to make an old game feel new again. That’s not easy to do, and while its multiplayer stumbles, Doom will leave you exhausted from its intensity, sick from its brutality, and yearning for more when you complete its 13-hour campaign. If you like your shooters fast and deadly, Hell is pretty heavenly."
"GameSpot","80","Many shooters chase the thrill Doom delivers, but few are as potent in their execution. It captures the essence of what made the classic Doom games touchstones of their day, and translates it to suit modern palates with impressively rendered hellscapes and a steady influx of tantalizing upgrades. Doom is the product of a tradition as old as shooters, and while it's not the model to follow in every case, modern shooters could learn a thing or two from Doom's honed and unadulterated identity."
"Game Rant","80","Combat may become a little tedious after long stretches of play, the load times are a little lengthy, multiplayer is a smudge unbalanced, and SnapMap is a so-so addition, but the adrenaline-fueled gameplay and the ample replayability featured within the campaign makes this a standout entry in the FPS genre – let alone a worthwhile resurrection of DOOM."
"Eurogamer Poland","80","Id Software proved that you can use a classic road to get to present time, without destroying the charm of the original. Doom remains an old-school, dynamic shooter devoid of lengthy cut-scenes and convoluted plot. It's a hell of a ride, just like twenty years ago."
"Time","80","What a pleasure it is not to have to reload weapons, or to glide over health and armor pickups without pausing to press buttons, or to whip through levels so straightforward they’re basically slides from one bloodbath to the next."
"Hardcore Gamer","80","Despite its shortcomings in the multiplayer — easily forgotten and waved off as an unnecessary add-on — and the rare instances of a mechanically loose screw, DOOM is undeniably one of the best looking and sounding shooters there has been for some time."
"JeuxActu","80","Violent, fast and visceral, Doom finally returns to its origins. The atmosphere and gameplay undoubtedly remind us of how powerful the saga was in the 90's."
"Digital Spy","80","Relax – this is very nearly the Doom you've always wanted but never really thought you'd get. By focusing on DOOM's brutal, ultraviolent heart iD has created an all-action FPS in the old-school style, but with next-gen looks and a handful of mod-cons. It's not going to reinvent the genre, but it might help you rediscover all the good stuff that used to make it tick."
"M3","80","After nearly 12 years Doom is back, and what a comeback. The action is both intensive and smooth, the combat mechanic is surprisingly deep and the graphics are fantastic. On the negative side the design starts to feel a bit repetitive towards the end, and the online mode isn’t as balanced as the best games in the genre. But overall, Doom is just pure fun."
"Examiner","80","Superbly fun. While there are nods to the previous games in the series, there are times where it does not “feel” like a Doom game. That does not deter from the overall experience. The game is gorgeous, sounds great, and offers reasons to come back and play. The SnapMap mode is an excellent touch, however the multiplayer feels added for the sake of having multiplayer. Doom is known for its single player experience, and that is where it excels the most."
"IGN Spain","80","Doom is saved by its frenetic gameplay represented in the campaign and its Snapmap editor that allows you to do everything. The game would have been better without a multiplayer that deducts."
"Gamer.no","80","It's very hard not to like the new Doom. The game's approach to shooting is fast, frantic and incredibly well-made, with a feeling of both old and new all at once. The story is relatively long, growing steadily more repetitive the more you play, but multiplayer and SnapMap work nicely as diversions, making the overall package very likeable."
"PlayStation LifeStyle","80","Defying the odds, id Software has made DOOM not only a relevant series in 2016, but a great one. They’ve also managed to create three distinct modes that all have their own appeal and feel to them. It’s an amazing package, and one that I’ll continue to come back to."
"InsideGamer.nl","75","The slogan 'Fight like Hell' says it all. Doom is brutal, it is quick and it is exactly what Doom was in the 90s. That is a big plus, but also a weakness as id Software simply can't manage to modernize the series. The story is insane, the tempo is odd and shooting gets a bit repetitive."
"Post Arcade (National Post)","75","Doom in 2016 may not be quite what I had anticipated, but it has just enough old and new to make me a fan."
"High-Def Digest","70","If you like a more-than-decent shooter and lots of blood splatters on your television screen, DOOM remains a force to be reckoned with. I just wish the game was a little more fun to play."
"Metro GameCentral","70","As graceful a marriage of old school action and modern sensibilities as you could probably hope for, despite the so-so multiplayer and repetitive setting."
"Slant Magazine","60","Doom feels stuck out of time, a gorgeous, gruesome beauty, but only inches removed from shooter conventions 15 years past their prime."
"Digitally Downloaded","50","People will be talking about the first two Doom games for decades more – those two games may well be remembered as true classics of the gaming medium a century down the track. This Doom won’t. This new Doom is terrible...Like the greedy organisation that unleashes hell on Mars, this is the product of exploitation; the developers at ID Software and Bethesda are playing with fire in treating a property as valuable as Doom this way."
