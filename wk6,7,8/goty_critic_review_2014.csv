2014,Bayonetta 2,"Bayonetta 2 will challenge some people. It will make the uncomfortable. It's transgressive in numerous ways, and with that comes the potential to offend. But in causing offence, Bayonetta 2 encourages conversation, and that's the very definition of a good work of art."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"Bayonetta 2 is a Game of the Year contender, which comes extremely recommended."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"Bayonetta 2 doesn\t do anything particularly new, but it does serve as an improvement of an already excellent action title, perfecting the formula even further."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"It's the obsession for detail that makes Bayonetta 2 so special. It might not be a unique game, but clearly one that's not common."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"Bayonetta 2 is the best action game ever made. Masterclass in terms of combat system, depth and accessibility, with frantic and intense progress. Unforgettable challenging boss battles, full of content to unlock and a lovely main character."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"Platinum Games manages to improve everything we knew and loved from the first game, creating a master piece everybody should play."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"The sheer polish applied to every part of Bayonetta 2 is something every major studio should aspire to: the exceptional and wide-ranging soundtrack, the huge number of unlocks, the Nintendo easter eggs, the \making of\ materials, and the unlockable characters that bring their own style. Not a single thing has been held back. In this second adventure, Bayonetta over-delivers in every regard, and it will be a long time before another fighting game threatens her crown."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"Bayonetta 2 doesn\t drastically change the already wacky formula that the first game introduced, but it\s a bigger and more nuanced version of its predecessor. It\s also the best game of its kind in years. If you\ve ever enjoyed this breed of reflex-heavy, hyperactive, ludicrous action game, Bayonetta 2 is a no-brainer."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"Bayonetta 2 is a triumphant return for the series and for Platinum Games. Extreme bosses, a crazy good style and an addictive co-op mode are just the icing on top of an excellent fighting system. Go get it now for your Wii U."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"Buy it if you liked the first one. Buy it, if you love it over the top all the way. Buy it if you love video games. Buy a Wii U if you have to. Bayonetta 2 sings all its praises in a celebration to this hobby of ours. But don't make the mistake of not playing it."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"It not only plays great, but there's so much style involved in just about every animation. Dashing turns you into a panther, double-jumping allows you to sprout butterfly wings, hovering turns you into a crow. Everything from the snapshot ""photo finish"" effect of completing a challenge room is painstakingly detailed."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"With Bayonetta 2, Wii U has its trump card: a queen of spades that takes advantages on almost every game of the genre and hits us right in the heart. It's an outstanding production, beautifully executed, with state of the art mechanics and ridiculously generous. And it can be enjoyed by everyone as its difficulty and handling can be adjusted. Definitely a beat them all no one has the right to ignore."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"Intense, gorgeous and thrilling to play, this is Platinum\s best game so far...A non-stop climax of excitement from the moment you start the Prologue, this is one of those games that demands to be played."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"Bayonetta 2 is the perfect action game. It oozes style and boasts gameplay that's both refined and lacking in excess. The combat is so purely entertaining that it's easy to lose yourself in the almost-zen flow of dodging, countering and kicking enemies to death."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"It is a masterclass in pure, unadulterated action-game design, where its insane eye-popping visuals meld effortlessly with some of the sharpest, most joyful combat to have ever graced a video game."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"Quite possibly the best action game ever made, Bayonetta 2 is a pure gem of wonder, filled with epic fights, perfect gameplay, a magnificent visual and sound environment and even a multiplayer mode which fits perfectly within the format. A diabolical masterpiece that no Wii U should go without."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"Sega's loss is Nintendo's gain: Bayonetta, twirling away from a gigantic demon's maw and smacking the highest choir of angels on the nose, has just given Wii U its first true classic. [Nov 2014, p.100]"
2014,Bayonetta 2,"From its peerless combat to its outlandishly entertaining world, Bayonetta 2 is a triumph. Platinum Games has created a classic so thoroughly excellent that it can\t be ignored. Action games don\t get better than this."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"The glorious return of Kamiya's beloved brainchild, Bayonetta 2 is a master lesson in arcade action, flow, design and skill, even if it doesn't burn with the same passion of its predecessor."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"Bayonetta 2 is nothing less than the best game in its genre, and it\s a solid reason to buy a Wii U."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"This is the game we were expecting, the one that gamers wanted. It's not so revolutionary as the first title, but it improves the gameplay lessons with a big personality."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"Filled with amazingly tuned combat, countless larger-than-life moments, copious amounts of legitimately challenging boss battles, interesting locations, lovable characters, and one of gaming\s most unforgettable heroines, Bayonetta 2 retains the crown as the standard for which all other stylish action games should strive to achieve."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"Bayonetta 2 is a smashing success, and proves that the WiiU can be the home of some great core titles."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"Bayonetta 2's only ""flaw"" is the very similar gameplay compared to the first chapter, but it's still a wonderful and engaging action game with tons of extras, replayability, online co-op and inspired graphics. Definitely one of the best games one can buy on Nintendo Wii U."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"This sequel builds on everything that made the original great, and delivers one of the most satisfying action games I've played."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"Not quite the landmark the original game was, but a thrillingly absurd, deep and beautiful brawler. Soul-bursting sorcery for devotees of the combo. [Christmas 2014, p.86]"
2014,Bayonetta 2,"It's action game J-style at its best, smooth to control, wonderful and crazy to watch. If you are even remotely interested in the genre, this is by far the best reason to own a WiiU as of today."
2014,Bayonetta 2,This is the best character action game out right now. Go get this videogame if you like character action games.
2014,Bayonetta 2,"It's absolutely a pure Bayonetta game, it's an absolute blast to play, and it absolutely belongs on Nintendo's growing roster of excellently crafted games for the Wii U."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"More of the same peerless action mechanics, barmy spectacle and wonderful depth. [Dec 2014, p.60]"
2014,Bayonetta 2,Bayonetta 2 is an outright fantastic game. It\s another very good reason to own a Wii U and it outclasses practically every other game of this type by a considerable margin.
2014,Bayonetta 2,"I had a lot of questions in my head when I launched Bayonetta 2 for the first time. Is it possible to design a combat system as awesome as before, make it familiar, but not hackneyed? Is it possible to outshine the closing moments of the first game? The sequel needed just a couple of minutes to dispel all my concerns. [Dec 2014, p.62]"
2014,Bayonetta 2,"Bayonetta 2 is a game whose gargantuan barrage of sex, violence, and surrealism sets the mind on fire in the best possible way."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"Bayonetta 2 is bigger, faster, crazier, and prettier than the original, and is very much deserving of your time."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"Bayonetta 2 is more than just a good action game, it is a fantastic addition to the already stellar Wii U lineup, and yet another reason to own the console."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"Bayonetta 2 is one of the best action games of this generation, and close to one of the best overall."
2014,Bayonetta 2,Bayonetta 2 is a silky smooth and highly-entertaining brawler that all Wii U owners should have in their collections.
2014,Bayonetta 2,"Bayonetta 2 is an exhausting, but incredibly fun game that through it's fantastic combat system will both challenge and reward you in equal amounts."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"Bayonetta 2 is not quite as good as the first Bayonetta, but that being said, the sequel is still a really terrific action game. [Oct 2014]"
2014,Bayonetta 2,"The campy hypersexuality feels joyful, rather than oppressive, because the character's overdetermined gender presentation is an expression of her power rather than a contrast to it."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"We would not call Bayonetta 2 revolutionary, but it is just as satisfying as the first one. The presentation is still a 'love it or hate it'-thing, but the refined gameplay is something not to miss, especially when you are a fan of the genre."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"Even though the game is technically perfectible, the fact that Bayonetta 2 is the best beat'em up game currently on sale shouldn't give you any doubts on weather to buy it or not. True question is this: is it worth buying a Wii U just for this game? Oh yeah it is."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"It is a suitably bonkers introduction and wastes no time getting to the nub of the game: that glorious combat. It hasn\t lost any of its shine. A system of extraordinary layers, the combat begins as a thing of simplicity with buttons for punch, kick, shoot and dodge. It then unfurls itself as you play, teaching through action."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"Bayonetta 2 may be nonsensical, tacky, and visually anarchic, but its got some of the finest combat an action game could offer. It's packed with style, looks magnificent, and is as elegant as spectacle fighter as you could hope for."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"Sexy, breathtaking, lighting fast, beautiful. If you loved the first one, hurry up and get this one too."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"A near-perfect action game, then, and a irrefutable reason to own a Wii U."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"Bayonetta 2 is the high-flying return of everyone's favorite Umbra Witch. Platinum Games pushes to the Wii U to its limit with fast action, magnificent vistas, and huge bosses. The addition of the original Bayonetta just pushes the entire package over the top. If you're a Devil May Cry fan, this is a must-buy."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"Calling it \crazy\ is not nearly enough. This game redefines action games, by taking everything to the next level. It's pure adrenaline, and its amazing combat system has yet to be reached. Its only fault lies in the excess of gigantic bosses, where the mechanics don't feel as perfect. If you love the action genre get this game. It's an order."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"Bayonetta 2 does not have the impact the original and fails to overcome it, but there are valuable additions like the cooperative mode."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"Despite not being as fresh and surprising as the original (which probably remains a better game overall), Bayonetta 2 is a heavenly triumph of excess: not only a sublime action game, but also a true killer application. Simply put, do not miss this one hell of a ride."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"Bayonetta 2 expresses a meticulous devotion to excessive elaborateness of style and action. It's a calculated brawler that not only minds its rules with painstaking diligence, but trusts its operator with how to best interpret them. The delicate engineering of merciless destruction has long been Platinum Games' modus operandi, and Bayonetta 2 is the purest and most potent declaration of their intentions."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"Bayonetta is is a must buy for any action gaming fans. It's fast, intense and ridiculous, all with an entertaining story and a protagonist that is forever subverting and playing with her audience. It's pure Platinum Games, too, which means it'll likely be adored by its converts and ignored by too many...Brilliant, brash and impossible to ignore."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"One of the best games to ever grace the Wii U. The sequel feels tighter, less obnoxious, and is a blast to play through. While the Wii U GamePad is not used in any significant way, and Tag Climax could have benefited from local co-op, this is the action-packed Bayonetta follow\up that I wanted."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"Bayonetta 2 is something new blended with something familiar, improved in every way possible. Few other games can top it for sheer audacity and ballsiness, and if this is the last time we\ll ever see the leggy witch, then she\s going out with one hell of a bang."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"A system seller. It's a Nintendo-published game that is rarely seen, and a game that will legitimately make non-Wii U owners jealous. It's everything I want from a hardcore Nintendo title, offering genre-leading combat and eye-popping visual spectacle."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"Fluid and satisfying combat remains the centerpiece of the experience. No matter what you do, Bayonetta 2 makes you look and feel awesome while doing it."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"Bayonetta 2's biggest disappointment may be that it's an iterative sequel, but it's not such a problem when it's iterating on genius."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"A fantastic sequel, whose improvements may be relatively subtle but are more than enough to confirm Bayonetta 2 as one of the greatest action games ever made."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"Bayonetta 2 is simply awesome. Platinum Games has done a great job improving their previous game, adding small details and creating a gorgeous looking new adventure for the sexy-witch. If you love action games, you can't miss this perfect cocktail of fun gameplay, great graphics and over-the-top humor."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"Bayonetta 2 is a solid game. It utilizes a simple yet interesting combo system, the visuals are gorgeous as they highlight your attacks and the enemies you battle, and the music and sound effects are top notch too. Although gameplay can be repetitive it still can be fun."
2014,Bayonetta 2,Visually and technically the Umbra witch showcases what Wii U can do. And even though you won\t get wowed as much as in the first bewitched action let me assure you: This is still one hell of a ride and easily one of the best action games of this year.
2014,Bayonetta 2,"The narrative is a bunch of cliches that had me checking my phone and skipping cutscenes. It\s not all bad. The characters are mostly interesting, and the presentation is well done. I also like that it takes place Christmas time. But that stuff isn\t enough to make up for another lackluster gaming story. It\s a bummer because Bayonetta is so cool, and she deserves the chance to shine in something better."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"Bayonetta 2 erects some of the most solid fighting mechanics and phantasmagorically gonzo visuals in gaming to date\certainly, something as compulsive and massive as this boosts the Wii U to the front of the pack\and through its formal choices communicates a singular, unfiltered vision of sexualization."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"Bayonetta 2 is a worthy sequel, filled with ridiculously over-the-top action sequences and a combat system par excellence. Just don\t come for the story."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"Even though Bayonetta 2 is very much like the first one in the franchise, it is lovely to hack and slash around with the oversexualised Cereza. The animal transformations of the witch are awesome and it is a very solid game for hours of fun."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"Not even Bayonetta can last forever. First few levels of the sequel are fantastic, but afterwards it\s all about \floating platforms in space\ and \featureless corridors\. Nothing here is as innovative or as provocative as the original Bayonetta. It\s still a solid action, mind you. But we hope that third installation will find some other publisher than Nintendo. [Dec 2014, p.80]"
2014,Bayonetta 2,"Bayonetta 2 contains, just like its predecessor, too much oldfashioned sexism. It's a pity because the intensity and variety inthis game is remarkable and all stages compete to be the most absurd.Perhaps the sequel is easier and hopefully that will attract moreplayers. If they're able to ignore the sexism, that is."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"Bayonetta 2 is not subtle and has too many cutscenes. But, the fighting is a lot more straightforward than in other hack and slashers and the flawless design plus the amazing detail convince us that Bayonetta 2 is an excellent game in its genre."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"Bayonetta 2 is manic, adrenaline-fueled combat at its best, showing tremendous depth beyond its shallow lead character."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"It's a frantic game packed with stunning set-pieces, thrilling boss battles and a fantastic combat system, even if it doesn't deviate too far from the original."
2014,Bayonetta 2,Beautiful destruction.
2014,Bayonetta 2,"More of the same is absolutely fine, as Bayonetta delivers her trademark action in true style. This sequel takes too long to get going and can feel harshly unfair, but when it's at its peak, the action is breathtaking."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"Something much more tame, a word that should be the antithesis of the series...Game developers won\t fix what isn\t broken and to do so is taking a huge risk, but Bayonetta is a series of firsts and this game feels like it\s playing on repeat."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"I won't guess why the blatant over-sexualization is still there, often more intensely than before. But it causes an otherwise great game to require a much bigger mental compromise to enjoy."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"While I didn\t spend much time in this mode, I did come to laugh more and more at Bayonetta\s awkward animations and slightly less-than-believable narrative shifts."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"Over the top yet unimaginative. At least the fights are dynamic and the game itself can be a breath of fresh air, considering what else is available on the Wii U. [Issue#245]"
2014,Dark Souls 2,"You'll get everything the fantastic console version had: a feeling of insecurity, respect for the apparently insurmountable, an unparalleled combat system. A nigh on perfect game."
2014,Dark Souls 2,"It is far and away the superior version, and that¡¦s without the need to download any sort of fan-made patch. The cycle of death and success has never felt this good."
2014,Dark Souls 2,"If you¡¦ve patiently waited for the PC release, consider yourself rewarded for said patience. This is hands-down the best version of Dark Souls 2 you¡¦ll be able to get, and shows a massive improvement over the lackluster effort that went into the first PC release of Dark Souls."
2014,Dark Souls 2,"Dark Souls 2 is not just a perfectly designed video game. It's a dark journey into a painful world of souls, a bet with your inner self and your strengths, the purification and absolute completion when the end credits fall... it's an experience like no other."
2014,Dark Souls 2,"The PC version of Dark Souls II is the definitive one to own. It¡¦s a good step up in the graphics and performance departments, annoying load times are drastically reduced, and players can even opt to play with the mouse and keyboard if they so desire. It shows that From Software spent a considerable amount of time attempting to come up with controls that would feel natural on the PC."
2014,Dark Souls 2,"This game¡¦s playability puts to shame everything that¡¦s been released for the new generation of consoles. [06/2014, p.54]"
2014,Dark Souls 2,Never has a game so difficult been so rewarding.
2014,Dark Souls 2,"This time around, From Software has nailed the PC version of its beloved franchise, leaving absolutely no doubt as to which platform gives players the best experience."
2014,Dark Souls 2,"Dark Souls II keep marking his very own label that players love. If you're a fan of the series, you¡¦ve got a new journey to play and replay until the world fall back into darkness."
2014,Dark Souls 2,"Finally, From Software manages to create a game on its own and not a lazy port. Dark Souls II is exactly the best way to play the masterpiece console gamers experienced a few weeks ago."
2014,Dark Souls 2,"From Software has not made the mistakes they made with the first episode on PC, but the improvements are limited to AI, resolution and framerate. Still, a great game worth playing."
2014,Dark Souls 2,"A truly unique experience, but it's not for everybody. You have to be aware of the words you're gonna read more than any others on your screen: ""You're Dead""."
2014,Dark Souls 2,"Dark Souls II is an ideal game for veteran players, but it's also a good chance for newcomers. From Software added some positive concessions while keeping the essence of the franchise. Action, exploration, replay value and great online experiences in another sweet nightmare. Prepare to die once again."
2014,Dark Souls 2,"From Software has clearly learned from its earlier mistakes by creating an absolutely wonderful PC version this time around. Shame about the monstrous keyboard and mouse controls, but nothing a controller won't fix. Aside of that, the core gameplay really shines, because of the many subtle improvements the PC version enjoys. The biggest achievement, however, is that one of the greatest games of 2014 has managed to become even greater."
2014,Dark Souls 2,"Dark Souls 2 respects gamers: it does not treat them like clueless, spoiled brogamerz, and that is something every publisher could learn from. [May 2014]"
2014,Dark Souls 2,"More accessible, challenging, and rewarding than its predecessor, this is the Dark Souls sequel PC gamers deserve."
2014,Dark Souls 2,"The definitive Dark Souls II experience, the latest entry to The Souls series shines on the PC. [June 2014, p.50]"
2014,Dark Souls 2,"The PC port is just as good, if not better than it's console counterpart, but you're going to want to use a gamepad. Using a keyboard is possible, and there's even a few mods out there to make it more functional and ergonomic, but it's still clunky and unintuitive compared to using a controller."
2014,Dark Souls 2,"Dark Souls II, as its blessing and its curse, is not another Dark Souls. It is, however, more Dark Souls - and it makes good on its hallowed name."
2014,Dark Souls 2,It¡¦s a marriage of phenomenal world design and impressively tight mechanics.
2014,Dark Souls 2,A carefully considered sequel that avoids upsetting existing fans and offers an olive branch to newcomers ¡V but although the PC version is the best it¡¦s by a slimmer margin than many would¡¦ve hoped.
2014,Dark Souls 2,"From Software has learned a lesson from the modders. Dark Souls 2 is the port that had been promised, featuring rich graphics options and well optimized. Hats off."
2014,Dark Souls 2,"Dark Souls 2 offers glimpses of hope and illumination, but they always feel just out of reach. Scratching just below the surface to take on the challenges Dark Souls 2 has for you is where this game's appeal lies. The game will not be for everyone, but for those willing to tackle this game, it is a rewarding experience."
2014,Dark Souls 2,"Dark Souls II is a very difficult game more than the first one. PC controls still have the same problem: they're complicated. The story and the maps are much more beautiful, graphics seem better than one consoles. If you are a fan of the Dark Souls series, you'll definitely love this one."
2014,Dark Souls 2,"Praise the Sun: the PC version of Dark Souls II isn't the total mess that its predecessor was. It may not be the prettiest or most graphically advanced game, but it runs stable and smooth at a 1080p resolution with 60 fps, even on a moderately powerful machine. As for the game itself, there's little else to be said: it's still bloody difficult and engaging, a true hardcore masterpiece."
2014,Dark Souls 2,"If you decided to wait for the PC version of Dark Souls II before jumping in, you¡¦ve made the right decision. It¡¦s not leaps and bounds better than its console counterpart, but the graphical enhancements aid the immersion."
2014,Dark Souls 2,Dark Souls 2 for the PC is a far cleaner port attempt than the first Dark Souls port.
2014,Dark Souls 2,"In many ways Dark Souls 2 is the technical and functional superior of the first game, but it does lack some of the semi-intangible magic of the original like its superlative interconnected world. Nonetheless, an impressive and essential sequel."
2014,Dark Souls 2,"You¡¦ll get higher resolutions and better framerates than on consoles. But with a game design of this quality, it doesn¡¦t really matter. Right now there is nothing better for fans of action roleplaying games."
2014,Dark Souls 2,"60 fps and higher resolution: this time around the PC version of Dark Souls II has been made with more care. Still, there are a lot of bugs and problems, that will be hopefully corrected with some patches."
2014,Dark Souls 2,"It¡¦s a testament to the series brand as a whole to make an otherwise solid title feel disappointing, but I¡¦ve come to expect more and I hope they find the right path through the dark in the next sequel."
2014,Dark Souls 2,"Games are simply developer-created hoops that we pay to jump through. In the case of Dark Souls 2, it¡¦s not exactly fun to do the jumping, but rather ¡§rewarding¡¨. What are you rewarded with? An emotion, a rush."
2014,Dark Souls 2,If you can ignore the still not perfect controls on PC then Dark Souls 2 is a great game for hardcore gamers that can endure some suffering. They will scream in front of the screen - out of joy and out of frustration.
2014,Dark Souls 2,"Despite the camera angle and controller issues, Dark Souls II is a great game."
2014,Dark Souls 2,"If you¡¦re a fan of hardcore games, try Dark Souls 2. It is not as memorable as its predecessor, and yet it is still a phenomenal experience."
2014,Dark Souls 2,"This game is art in the good and bad sense of the word. It represents some of the best things that video games have to offer: at its most immersive, it offers a beautifully and thoughtfully rendered world to be explored that reveals itself not just through what is seen on the screen, but through the brutal and challenging experiences the player guides the in-game avatar through. The negative part of that is that the story of the game and the motivations and reasoning behind what is happening are obscure and unclear. A lot of the onus is on the player to piece things together. This is a kind of experience that is not necessarily designed to appeal to a broad swath of people, but its pitch perfect execution and strict adherence to its draconian design principles earn it a place in the pantheon of great games."
2014,Dragon Age: Inquisition,"BioWare achieved everything that it needed to with Dragon Age: Inquisition. It revitalised a series that had suffered real brand damage in Dragon Age II, and easily stands as the best RPG we've seen in years. There is absolutely no reason to miss out on this one."
2014,Dragon Age: Inquisition,"For a fantasy game presenting dozens of hours of gameplay, Dragon Age: Inquisition largely delivers on its promises, both mechanically and in gameplay that fans will want from the third title in the series."
2014,Dragon Age: Inquisition,"Dragon Age: Inquisition is an amazing game. There really is something special about it. I know a lot of people were down on Dragon Age II, but this game redeems every issue you may have had with the last game."
2014,Dragon Age: Inquisition,"It's a gorgeous game on an epic scale. Rich in character and story, it creates a fantasy world with plausible social rules you can get lost in. It makes you feel that you aren't just exploring a new world, but helping shape it at various levels of society. Inquisition sets the bar for what a blockbuster RPG should be."
2014,Dragon Age: Inquisition,"Dragon Age: Inquisition has incredibly deep and complex parts, while still maintaining the core gameplay values that Bioware knows how to do best with their third-person action titles. The game delivers everything promised, including gorgeous visuals and a strong story. Simply put, Bioware has returned the Dragon Age series to the greatness it truly deserves."
2014,Dragon Age: Inquisition,Dragon Age Inquisition is a must play RPG on the PS4 that successfully takes the best out of both previous games to create sword and sorcery perfection.
2014,Dragon Age: Inquisition,This amazing RPG should have a place in every gamer's collection.
2014,Dragon Age: Inquisition,"Dragon Age: Inquisition is the role-playing game you¡¦ve wanted for years. You glimpsed the future and now, with a few minor exceptions, that vision has been fully realized."
2014,Dragon Age: Inquisition,"Overall, Dragon Age: Inquisition is a great game that everyone should have in their collection. It¡¦s one of the best bangs for your buck out there in terms of how much time you will clock in on this one and also in quality."
2014,Dragon Age: Inquisition,It's easily the company¡¦s greatest achievement. The expertly crafted story and the massive world meant for your exploration are just the tip of the iceberg...Easily the best RPG of the year.
2014,Dragon Age: Inquisition,"This is the return of the great Bioware, back on a path that we hope they don't leave ever again. Emotive amount and variety of content makes for an incredible adventure."
2014,Dragon Age: Inquisition,"BioWare¡¦s about to drop its mic and walk off stage...It is a paragon of multiple-path storytelling and character development. It offers a master class in intricate, customizable, multi-hero combat. And it delivers not one but ten beautiful and expansive open worlds to explore, boldly throwing down the gauntlet to rival developers."

2014,Dragon Age: Inquisition,"Dragon Age: Inquisition puts the fate of the world in your hands in a way that few role-playing games have done before. And even after another 80 hours devoted to it, it's a world I cannot wait to return to in whatever BioWare does next. I don't know what higher praise I could give."
2014,Dragon Age: Inquisition,"If you think Bioware messed up with Dragon Age 2 and Mass Effect 3, Dragon Age: Inquisition will be your cure. Hold your breath, behold the great gaming atmosphere. Dragon Age: Inquisition brings you back to the series origins. It's one of 2014's most successful games with an impressive fighting system."
2014,Dragon Age: Inquisition,"Despite a questionable predecessor and a somewhat rushed release intime for Christmas, Bioware has managed to create a fantasticadventure that easily ranks among the best games of the year. If youwant to sink your teeth into a deep and long lasting role playinggame, Dragon Age Inquisition is the game to get."
2014,Dragon Age: Inquisition,"A stunning, must have RPG."
2014,Dragon Age: Inquisition,"With superb writing and rewarding gameplay, Dragon Age: Inquisition offers just about everything that you could want from a genre that's been sorely missed on the PS4."

2014,Dragon Age: Inquisition,"Dragon Age: Inquisition starts off as a good game and keeps getting better as it goes along. This doesn't mean the early parts are insufferable, but instead shows how the game continues to build and develop throughout its entirety."

2014,Dragon Age: Inquisition,Dragon Age: Inquisition is a wonderful game and a lengthy pilgrimage to a magical world with vital thematic ties to one we already know.
2014,Dragon Age: Inquisition,"Dragon Age: Inquisition returns the franchise to right path after disappointing second installation. Its massive world combined to leading the ever growing Inquisition makes the game really addictive. Plot could be more coherent, but after 40 hours I still crave to search every inch of the world."
2014,Dragon Age: Inquisition,"Exciting, very detailed in every area, full of brilliant dialogues, characters and things to do including crafting, remote missions, exploration and a very well balanced leveling. Add great visuals and you'll have the best episode of the series so far."
2014,Dragon Age: Inquisition,"It¡¦s a surprisingly huge, dense world, and I soon realized there were still entire sandboxes I hadn¡¦t even set foot in. Even in my hundredth hour, I¡¦m still discovering."
2014,Dragon Age: Inquisition,"Inquisition is a Schrodinger¡¦s Goldilocks kind of a game: too big and just right at the same time...The main campaign is more interested in telling you how great you are than letting you prove it, and combat feels designed for a game half this size. It¡¦s not a far fall from grace, by any means, but it¡¦s noticeable ¡X and occasionally grating ¡X in such a long experience. But if you have been working for the Inquisition for that long, hopefully by then you will be too busy discovering and exploring to care that much."
2014,Dragon Age: Inquisition,"Takes far too long to get going, but once it does you'll be hooked for the longest haul. [Jan 2015, p.64]"
2014,Dragon Age: Inquisition,"The Dragon Age game people who hate Dragon Age will like. [January 2015, p76]"
2014,Dragon Age: Inquisition,"It is not a revolution, but it is one of the best RPGs we've seen in a while. Definitely, the best of its genre on the next generation of consoles."
2014,Dragon Age: Inquisition,"Dragon Age: Inquisition is the biggest and best Dragon Age to date. Packed to the brim with content and carefully refined mechanics, it's sure to please any Dragon Age fan. It has a fair share of problems, but none detract too much from the strong core experience."
2014,Dragon Age: Inquisition,"Inquisition is a triumph and proves that despite some missteps along the way, BioWare hasn't lost its touch."
2014,Dragon Age: Inquisition,"An exhaustive and impactful world let down by predictable aesthetics and combat. [Issue#251, p.70]"
2014,Dragon Age: Inquisition,"A flawed almost-classic. [Jan 2015, p.84]"
2014,Dragon Age: Inquisition,"Once you've dipped into the game's heavily customizable odds and ends, and made decent strides in the core campaign, you'll soon realize just how much there is to do and see in Thedas and its many regions."
2014,Dragon Age: Inquisition,Dragon Age Inquisition is a solid RPG that should conquer any gamer's heart with its well-rounded gameplay. Definitely a big improvement over the last game in the IP.
2014,Dragon Age: Inquisition,"Dragon Age: Inquisition creates a massive, vibrant world on a scale far greater than its predecessors, and does an excellent job of making you feel in command. The heart of this game rests with its characters, who keep you invested in the action."
2014,Dragon Age: Inquisition,"I¡¦ve had a great time leading the Inquisition. It¡¦s unusual to be able to look back at a game like this and have such fine memories, despite being so underwhelmed by its opening hours. For some, it may well feel like too much of a grind to begin with, and for time-poor players those 15 hours may be far too much of an investment."
2014,Dragon Age: Inquisition,"It might be conventional as far as visuals and monsters go, but its overall appeal rests in its provision of a living world that can be sculpted and altered in ways both subtle and explicit. So long as you're prepared to put the required time in, Dragon Age: Inquisition has plenty to give."
2014,Dragon Age: Inquisition,"Inquisition will most likely suffer the same fate as its predecessors. It¡¦s a fun game that will probably never achieve a broad fan base, but there will be those that love the game and will go to great lengths to defend it with rabid aggression. All told, I was expecting more but I¡¦m not really that surprised. I had fun and that¡¦s what counts."
2014,Dragon Age: Inquisition,"Inquisition feels slick but siloed. The story and exploration parts of the game are boxed separately, and the latter is full of prefab errands with few ties to the themes of the Dragon Age setting."
2014,Dragon Age: Inquisition,Lovely design and solid atmosphere but the gameplay feels clunky.
2014,HearthStone,"Between its friendly design and its flexible approach to a free-to-play economy, Hearthstone has successfully pulled me into a genre that I didn't care about in the least. But even more incredibly, it's kept me rapt longer than any games I've played in years, and shows no signs of letting up."
2014,HearthStone,"It's overflowing with character and imagination, feeds off and fuels a vibrant community of players and performers, and it only stands to improve as Blizzard introduces new features, an iPad version and expansions. And now it's finally finished! I can't wait to see where it goes next. Job's done."
2014,HearthStone,"It¡¦s easy to learn, easy to get into matches and play, and it¡¦s fun. It¡¦s led me to check out other digital card games ¡X and I¡¦m again surprised at how much I enjoy these."
2014,HearthStone,"When Blizzard announced they were making a digital CCG, we all expected it to look and sound beautiful, and there was little doubt that it would be well-balanced, but I don¡¦t think anyone anticipated this level of sophistication and subtle brilliance."
2014,HearthStone,"A gem that combines a great PC franchise with simple gameplay and a reasonable Free to Play business model. [June 2014, p.54]"
2014,HearthStone,"Hearthstone, the newest card game from Blizzard, will keep you hooked for hours thanks to the amazing presentation and the tactical, deep gameplay. This is free to play done right."
2014,HearthStone,"With bags of depth to tap into, this deserves to be recognised as one of the genre's finest. [June 2014, p.72]"
2014,HearthStone,"A beautifully designed game, as gratifying and addictive as anything Blizzard has ever done. [June 2014, p.72]"
2014,HearthStone,"It has, through painstaking effort, upgraded the card duel into a thoroughly modern form. It has resisted the dark lures of free-to-play, and has made deep systems simple to parse without neutering them. In short, Hearthstone is borderline alchemy, turning physical systems into digital gold."
2014,HearthStone,"Hearthstone is addictive, highly strategic, and chock-full of fun collectible card battling; the fact that it's totally free (if you want it to be) makes it one of the best values in gaming today. This is your new obsession; embrace it."
2014,HearthStone,"Blizzard's first Free to Play-game offers depth without becoming complex. It takes players seriously and is very playable without spending (a lot of) money. Atmosphere, speed and great sound effects make for fast yet satisfying games, where luck and tactics go hand in hand."
2014,HearthStone,"Hearthstone is thoughtful and complex, but at the same time welcoming and almost irresistible. It may just be a card game, but it often feels like so much more."
2014,HearthStone,"Blizzard's team has done about everything right with Hearthstone. They took tried and tested pieces from other card games, found clever mechanisms to take away their weak spots and other frustrations and offer a strong and addictive free-to-play experience."
2014,HearthStone,"Blizzard has put its imprimatur onto another genre, and it looks poised to succeed in CCGs with Hearthstone as it has with MMOs in World of Warcraft."
2014,HearthStone,"Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft is the best digital collectible card game for everyone. Easy to learn and difficult to master. The musical score and sounds are just like the Warcraft Universe. But if you are a Magic: The Gathering player, you definitely won't like it."
2014,HearthStone,"Hearthstone seems a good fit for tablets, and if Blizzard can maintain the quality of the animations, it will become a serious phenomenon."
2014,HearthStone,An amazing classic card game that surprises for its attention to detail and highly addictive gameplay.
2014,HearthStone,"Hearthstone is the best digital collectible card game around and an excellent ¡§real¡¨ game as well, where the formula ¡§easy to learn, difficult to master¡¨ really comes to life."
2014,HearthStone,"Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft is an idea as good as Magic: The Gathering was. It's very similar to Magic cards and that's great. Although it's very accessible and visual, perfect for new players and experts. Blizzard has returned to work magic."
2014,HearthStone,"Hearthstone might not fully scratch the strategy itch of the most advanced CCG/TCG players, but it makes an impressive attempt. The rules are simple, so anybody can get the hang of it, but there are enough deck variations available that only skilled deck builders and players will make it high in the ranks."
2014,HearthStone,"Accessible, addictive and fun, Blizzard brings us a very interesting free-to-play, very well balanced game, that everyone interested in the Warcraft universe should try."
2014,HearthStone,"Hearthstone is a wonderful game. Nostalgic, simple and best of all: fun. This is the best online collectible card game you can play. Just be careful how much you spend in it."
2014,HearthStone,"The elegant simplicity of Hearthstone¡¦s rules, its impressive attention to detail and personality, and the true viability of playing completely for free make it easy to fall under its spell and get blissfully lost in the depths of its strategic possibilities."
2014,HearthStone,"If you¡¦ve ever been curious about collectible card games but didn¡¦t know where to begin, Hearthstone is the place to start."
2014,HearthStone,"A simple game if compared to Magic, nonetheless the Blizzard CCG delivers a fair amount of depth for the average player. There is a little shade of pay-to-win, but is perfectly possible to have fun without spending a dime."
2014,HearthStone,"On a more personal level, Hearthstone is solid enough that if it gets its hooks in you, they will dig deep. The game takes on a Civilization-like level of addictiveness where instead of one more turn, you¡¦ll often tell yourself ¡§just one more game¡¨. That one more game can quickly become five, or ten, or more depending on how much time you have to spend and I imagine this is going to only be amplified once the mobile versions of the game come online."
2014,HearthStone,"Simple rules, high production values, low system requirements and huge tactical freedom make Hearthstone one of the best card games available. And if you take into account the free-to-play model ¡V it¡¦s the best one. [05/2014, p.62]"
2014,HearthStone,"A fine example of a great free-to-play game. Hearthstone is not only an addictive and well designed card game, but absolutely fair with gamers that do not wish to spend money on it."
2014,HearthStone,"Hearthstone is a polished, stylish and friendly collectible card game which offers tons of fun and challenge at no cost. It's still not very balanced - and probably will never be - and it lacks a trading system, but Blizzard managed to appeal both newcomers and veterans to the genre."
2014,HearthStone,"Hearthstone is currently the best card game in circulation when you consider its target audience. With easy-to-learn gameplay, this game is still able to provide a lot of satisfaction even to the most experienced players."
2014,HearthStone,"It¡¦s this level of polish and accessibility that Blizzard have infused into Hearthstone that make it a great success, no matter how you feel about card games."
2014,HearthStone,One of the best free-to-play games on the market because you can actually play this one for free and have a good time while doing so. It is easy to learn and fun to master. [Apr 2014]
2014,HearthStone,Hearthstone wants to be a fast paced and entertaining card game for beginners and experts alike - and it achieves this goal with flying colors.
2014,HearthStone,"Video gamers may wonder why they would play a card game when their medium has moved beyond such limitations; tabletop gamers may bemoan the fact that people are getting excited about the wrong card game. But if you fall awkwardly between those two groups, Hearthstone will keep you hooked for some time."
2014,HearthStone,"For now, Hearthstone is very much a triumph, and with a mobile client rolling out there¡¦s a sense that we¡¦re at the beginning of a phenomenon rather than in the midst of one. Yet again, Blizzard seems to have played its cards absolutely right."
2014,HearthStone,"A fast, deep and exciting card game let down by its business model. Great when you're on a roll, rough when you're not. [Apr 2014, p.84]"
2014,HearthStone,"Brilliantly accessible, yet incredibly deep. Blizzard dominates the virtual gaming card genre, but a tournament mode would have made it even better."
2014,HearthStone,"If any developer's good at weeding out the chaff of more robust games in a particular genre, surely it's Blizzard."
2014,HearthStone,This first attempt from Blizzard on the free to play market is a success. You don't have to pay to win in this card game that looks really nice and is as interesting as addictive to play.
2014,HearthStone,"While it may not be as complicated as an actual collectible card game, or have the appeal of showing off your collection to your friends, it is a great videogame that has minimal issues and is in a neat package, so it would be foolish to try to compare it to something it¡¦s not trying to be."
2014,HearthStone,"It's difficult to resist the charms of HearthStone: Heroes of WarCraft, which stacks up qualities. Easily manageable by any gamer, highly addictive, and made with an artistic touch, this game fully uses the rich Warcraft universe and its fame. The price to pay is having to make due with classic card game gameplay, not a revolution in the card collecting game genre...and it can prove tiresome at some point if you don't go hunting for the rare cards. Strangely, the interface needs improvement, and some bugs still persists. But since the game is free and really fun, there is no reason to not give it a try."
2014,HearthStone,"Hearthstone is a well-executed and fun card game, one which lives the ¡§easy to learn, hard to master¡¨ mantra to the utmost."
2014,Middle Earth,"Right now, it¡¦s my main contender for game of the year, simply because, in its lack of pretension, its attention to detail and its understanding that video games first and foremost should be fun, it puts everything else I¡¦ve played recently in its long shadow."
2014,Middle Earth,"Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is the most fun I've had with an open-world game in a very long time...Whatever your feelings on J. R. R. Tolkien and the Middle-earth milieu, it's hard to imagine any fan of open-world action having anything less than a great time with this game."
2014,Middle Earth,What would have otherwise been a competent sandbox game with solid combat mechanics and an interesting twist on a known fantasy world is elevated by the Nemesis System. Shadow of Mordor is the strategic person's action game.
2014,Middle Earth,"Shadow of Mordor is without a doubt the best The Lord of the Rings game that I have ever played, and quite probably the best game I've played this year. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a great action game."
2014,Middle Earth,Shadow of Mordor is that ultimate rarity. It tells a fun little story that would be enough to hold up most games on their own. But it also provides all of the tools to ensure that the most interesting tales to come out of the game will be the ones that were not scripted.
2014,Middle Earth,"Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor stands out from other open-world action games by putting a great new layer on top of the trail that Batman blazed. I was surprised at how well it integrates its excellent combat with rewarding feedback and progression not just for me, but also for my enemies. I"
2014,Middle Earth,"All in all, I really enjoyed Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor. While the game had always been on my radar, I still find myself pretty surprised with how fantastic it ended up being."
2014,Middle Earth,"For people who are alright with playing fifteen hours or so of Helm¡¦s Deep-style carnage, Shadow of Mordor is a delight ¡V and even for people who couldn¡¦t care less about Lord of the Rings, the exciting combat and unique Nemesis System are more than enough to make the experience worthwhile."
2014,Middle Earth,As a gamer you owe it to yourself to experience Shadow of Mordor if not for anything else other than the Nemesis system because playing a single-player game never made you feel less alone.
2014,Middle Earth,"A precious package that is both incredibly challenging and rewarding in all the right ways. [December 2014, p70]"
2014,Middle Earth,"While there are a limited number of genuinely memorable landmarks in the world of Mordor, the real points of interest is the captains being hunted."
2014,Middle Earth,Shadow of Mordor is without doubt the best Middle-earth game available on consoles.
2014,Middle Earth,"A stunning title that mixes the best parts of other games, whilst introducing its own ideas."
2014,Middle Earth,"Combining the transversal and exploration of Assassin's Creed and the combat of the Batman: Arkham franchise, Monolith Productions has created not only the best title in the Middle-earth franchise, but probably the best action title of the year."
2014,Middle Earth,"While not perfect, Shadow of Mordor surpasses expectations - it's fun, engaging and truly impressive. The Nemesis System is a stroke of genius and sets this game apart from its competitors. A serious contender for Game of the Year."
2014,Middle Earth,"Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor isn¡¦t perfect. The somewhat repetitive nature of the side content and lame final acts prevent it from achieving our top score, but do not mistake us when we say this, because it¡¦s one of the best games that we¡¦ve played this year."
2014,Middle Earth,"Dark, compelling, and occasionally unflinchingly brutal, Shadow of Mordor is Lord of the Rings for grown-ups. It¡¦s not just a good game based on an established franchise, but a fantastic game in its own right and one that deserves to be judged purely by its own merits, and not by what has come before."
2014,Middle Earth,A great example of what_s possible to make with talent and passion and a popular license. One of the sleeper hits of the year.
2014,Middle Earth,The game isn't perfect - resurrecting foes can be frustrating - but those issues won't hold you back from enjoying yourself.
2014,Middle Earth,Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is the first game on these new consoles that screams next generation game play.
2014,Middle Earth,"A beautiful third-person action title that has deep role-playing game elements embedded firmly into it. You also get enormously detailed and deep environments, with unique enemies to populate it. This is simply a superb game."
2014,Middle Earth,"Middle-earth just wants the player to explore it like a playground. You can climb up structures, leap from them to tackle a wild creature of the land, and even enlist your own group to drive the dramas that ensue. Shadow of Mordor paints the pictures that rest somewhere between bookends."
2014,Middle Earth,"Shadow of Mordor is a triumph, its final irony being that it's arguably the best and most pure Assassin's Creed game to date."
2014,Middle Earth,Shadow of Mordor is the rare Arkham clone that transcends its status.
2014,Middle Earth,"Although it comes in the wake of dozens before it, Shadow of Mordor is the definitive Middle-earth experience. It smartly avoids trying to adapt already existing plot points, instead crafting its own unique story and overall experience."
2014,Middle Earth,It¡¦s a fun game that lets you experience The Lord of the Rings regardless of how much knowledge you have of the world coming in. Great combat and an amazing setting round out one of the best Lord of the Rings titles in years.
2014,Middle Earth,"Shadow of Mordor is influenced by other games, but not defined by them. Instead it takes pieces from some of the best games of the last few years, augments them with RPG mechanics and the new Nemesis system, and integrates them all so well together that it's sometimes hard to tell where one system begins and another ends. It's a remarkable achievement."
2014,Middle Earth,"If you are not overly familiar with the lore from the books and movies, you may find it difficult to appreciate most of the content available here, but you will still find a fantastically fun fantasy action title with a robust amount of content, with some familiar core gameplay."
2014,Middle Earth,"By turning your every death into the start of a personal vendetta, Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor makes you that much more invested in its open-world. The savage combat and satisfying stealth are just the means to exacting your ultimate revenge."
2014,Middle Earth,"As an open world game set in Middle-earth, Shadow of Mordor delivers unique emergent gameplay, finely-tuned combat mechanics and a story which avoids typical fantasy fare. While the main storyline can be finished relatively quickly, there is a lot of content in Mordor for you to pursue however you like."
2014,Middle Earth,A solid side-story from an established universe with spot-on gameplay makes this a surprise contender for one of the year¡¦s best games.
2014,Middle Earth,"A very satisfying, Uruk Hai quality Tolkien experience."
2014,Middle Earth,It¡¦s not without its flaws ¡V the story could have been better focused and the campaign missions less repetitive ¡V but Shadow of Mordor is easily the best video game set in The Lord of the Rings universe to date.
2014,Middle Earth,"Middle-Earth: Shadows of Mordor is a remarkable game, with an uncharismatic main character surrounded by enemies whose design is really spectacular, lots of content to complete and guaranteed fun. And, on top of that, it's a game that, despite being clearly influenced by others, has its own style."
2014,Middle Earth,"This is a great, fresh open world action adventure game, with a very well-implemented Nemesis system. It's an outstanding surprise, and we think it deserves a try."

2014,Middle Earth,"A game that delivers the fantasy goods in spades. The ultra-anal Tolkien lovers might take issue with Talion and how the game is presented, and the AI and frame-rate issues are clear. That being said, this remains a wildly immersive, engaging adventure with an excellent combination of action and platforming elements."
2014,Middle Earth,"A tale of revenge, madness and brutality, this is not a fairytale epic quest, but a bloody journey of hunting and killing. And with the best Uruk-hais enemies the Nemesis system can provide. A good game, a great experience that can be enjoyed by fans and non-fans of Tolkien."
2014,Middle Earth,"The world feels alive and treacherous, the combat gives you lots of gruesome options, and the enemy army is always evolving. It might not offer the challenge you crave, but if you enjoy killing orcs, there are two maps filled with the savage monsters and they're all looking for a fight."
2014,Middle Earth,"Shadow of Mordor is the utter proof that to build an engaging, deep and fun experience you don't have to innovate - not necessarily. There are small flaws, especially in the repetitiveness of the mission structure (especially in the second half) and in the open world maps, which are too empty even for Mordor. But that's not nearly enough to spoil the fun, and the Nemesis System is something every developer should look into (and probably will)."
2014,Middle Earth,"Despite the dark setup, Shadow of Mordor doesn¡¦t offer any surprises. It¡¦s a solid action-adventure spiced up with some RPG elements and a familiar license. As far as the license games go, Talion¡¦s trek is well executed mesh of Arkham games and Assassin¡¦s Creed. You could do a lot worse. [Oct 2014]"
2014,Middle Earth,"Despite the use of a lot of recycled mechanics, the developers have demonstrated passion and intelligence, mixing the ingredients and creating a product that, despite the similarity with some of the most acclaimed series, retains its uniqueness and features a campaign with a perfect rhythm."
2014,Middle Earth,"Shadow of Mordor is the best Lord of the Rings-game ever, maybe because it ignores so many of Tolkien's written rules. Thanks to the fantastic Nemesis-system and the familiar feeling of climbing and fighting, this game knows how to avoid the curse of bad licensed games."
2014,Middle Earth,"Shadow of Mordor takes lots from other games but offers enough originality to make it worth your while. You should be even more interested if you're a fan of Jackson's movies - Monolith's game is based first and foremost on this particular license. The game mixes slasher and stealth elements very well, presents a juicy and brutal piece of Middle-earth's story and proves that neglecting this universe isn't a good thing."
2014,Middle Earth,"Slaughtering Orks with Assassin's Creed-like stealth-gameplay and beating them silly with the fighting-system we know of the Arkham Batman games: it's lot of fun for a good while. Shadow of Mordor offers raw, nasty action, plus enough collectibles, upgrades and other free-roaming tricks to keep you hooked. The biggest surprise though is that it's all interwoven by an interesting, almost Tolkien-worthy narrative."
2014,Middle Earth,"The landscapes and exploration elements might not be on the level of some of its open-world brethren, but Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor delivers one of the best games to feature the intricate lore of J.R.R. Tolkien¡Xand its innovative, addictive Nemesis system could redefine the way developers design enemy encounters in the future."
2014,Middle Earth,"Shadow of Mordor is an unabashedly challenging and complex experience, sometimes at the expense of accessibility."
2014,Middle Earth,"Shadow of Mordor is a visually stunning, narratively compelling action RPG that had me enthralled from start to finish. This is how you make a non-canon story in Middle-earth feel like it belongs, like it could be its own book or film in the world Tolkien created. It¡¦s violent, it¡¦s addictive, and it controls like a dream."
2014,Middle Earth,"A lot in Middle Earth is reminiscent of other games: Fight like Batman, sneak like Ezio and his brethren, explore the world like in Red Dead Redemption. What sets Shadow of Mordor apart is the Nemesis system that works surprisingly well ¡V even though it lacks drama in the end."
2014,Middle Earth,"In many respects, Shadow of Mordor is a rip-off of other titles, but its one original idea - the Nemesis system - ensures that doesn't matter. Manipulation and subterfuge are always fun. [Issue#250, p.66]"
2014,Middle Earth,"It could do with a little more polish, but Mordor is still one of this year's better surprises. [Dec 2014, p.88]"
2014,Middle Earth,Assassin's Creed meets Batman and gets up close and personal with the orcs. The most exciting visit to virtual Middle-earth in years. [Issue#246]

2014,Middle Earth,"Shadow of Mordor is a good surprise for many reasons. We were not expecting anything from another Lord of the Rings game, but this one is a very good action packed open world RPG."
2014,Middle Earth,"Shadow of Mordor expands the lore of the Lord of the Rings books in a respectful and great way and the Nemesis system is something that many developers should copy. There are some problems here, but the truth is that this is one of the best ""Lord of the Rings"" games ever made."
2014,Middle Earth,"It may not be wholly original, but thanks to a compelling Nemesis System, Shadow of Mordor forges its own unique path, which marks it out for praise."
2014,Middle Earth,"Fans and non-fans of The Lord of the Rings, especially the people who enjoy open world games ¡V such as the two games that inspired Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor ¡V would be hobbit mad to miss this great action game."
2014,Middle Earth,"If Monolith's ducks had all been in a row, Mordor could have been a top contender for the year, but even so, it's still worth getting into for no other reason than it delivers what I've wanted from Assassin's Creed since the start."
2014,Middle Earth,"Shadow of Mordor combines different parts of other successful games, like Assassin¡¦s Creed and Batman: Arkham City, but the game has a unique selling point: the Nemesis-system, which really makes Mordor come to life. Even though the story is insignificant here, Shadow of Mordor remains a fun and original game."
2014,Middle Earth,"Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor remixes influences from both theBatman: Arkham and Assassin's Creed-series together with it's ownideas and the result is the best Lord of the Rings game so far. Thestory may not carry all the way but this is a violent, intelligent andvaried action game that rewards creativity and strategy from theplayer."
2014,Middle Earth,"This isn't the one game to rule them all, but it's a powerful experience in its own right, one that every fantasy enthusiast should pick up."
2014,Middle Earth,"The take away from Shadow of Mordor is that it¡¦s fittingly a game that should inspire games in the same way it has so clearly been inspired, taking strong systems from big games and adding a few new ones of its own. I¡¦d love to see the nemesis system be applied in a more intricate way to the handling of intelligence assets in the world of international espionage, for example, or maybe even an interpretation of the interpolitics of mafia families in the mid century."
2014,Middle Earth,"A good game in its own right, Shadow of Mordor doesn¡¦t need nor improves upon Tolkien's fiction. Sadly, though, exploitable combat mechanics, repetitive missions and an unsatisfactory navigation system hinder its chances of becoming one of the best games of the year."
2014,Middle Earth,"A far better game than many would¡¦ve imagined, not just in terms of its action and Lord of the Rings authenticity ¡V but in bringing a genuinely new idea to gaming."
2014,Middle Earth,"An engaging, fun and more organic open world than the ones we¡¦re used to, but its essence lies almost exclusively in the prolonged, never-ending combat that in the long run wears a bit thin, no matter how well built it is."
2014,Middle Earth,"So it's true. One does not simply walk into Mordor. But seeing as we're already here, we might as well pull some Uruk Hai strings, watch a few heads roll and make ourselves at home."
2014,Middle Earth,"Fantastic gameplay, great graphics. Just wished the story was a little bit stronger."
2014,Middle Earth,"Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor plays heavenly thanks not only to the stolen gameplay system but the interesting never-before-seen Nemesis system. The story will certainly please fans of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings thanks to the interquel nature of the story. It¡¦s just a shame that the characters from the original Tolkien novels that make an appearance are sorely underused and therefore pointless. Furthermore, the two maps are fairly small, and certainly so when compared to other games with an open world design."
2014,Middle Earth,"I think Shadow of Mordor deserves a huge audience. I like it bordering on loving it. Had Monolith tightened up a few things, I¡¦d probably love it bordering on considering it one of the best games of the year."
2014,Middle Earth,"A hugely entertaining, tongue-in-cheek and fulsome experience, it¡¦s a worthy expedition whether you¡¦re a Rings fan or not."
2014,Middle Earth,"Easy comparisons aside, this is a great game in its own right, narratively disjointed but mechanically sound, made up of excellent parts pieced together in excellent ways."
2014,Middle Earth,"At the start of the game you're not much more than a lowly Ranger, sneaking through camps and silently slitting Orcish throats in the night. By the end of the game you're boldly strolling through those same camps, as terrified uruks whisper tales of the Ranger-turned-Gravewalker over fortifying gulps of grog."
2014,Middle Earth,These theoretical games are why it can feel like Shadow of Mordor is not ¡§a good Lord of the Rings game¡¨ but simply a good game. But the truth is that it is a good game in spite of the fact that it has bones that threaten to burst from the fantasy skin laid overtop; that it is yearning to mutate out of this Lord of the Rings form and into something truly revolutionary.
2014,Middle Earth,"Batman¡¦s Creed: Shadow of Mordor ¡V Monolith¡¦s inspirations are so obvious that you could call their game a rip-off. Its greatest sin though is the fact that it fails to vary gameplay the way Assassin¡¦s Creed or Batman do and offers almost nothing apart from killing stuff and playing with the Nemesis system (which, I admit, has its moments). I got so tired with its repetitiveness that I wouldn¡¦t have finished the game if I didn¡¦t have to. [Dec 2014, p.48]"
2014,Middle Earth,"It's a shame that the terrain you wander through as you do all this is so visually substandard. [Dec 2014, p.116]"
2014,Middle Earth,"Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor emerges as a highly entertaining proposal and is able to entertain for hours on end, unless you have an ethical problem with killing Uruks."
2014,Middle Earth,"Although Shadow of Mordor's world never feels as alive as the ones from Skyrim or Fallout, the new Nemesis system is a great idea that makes normal battles something much more interesting."
2014,Middle Earth,"With the Nemesis system, Monolith Productions has created a living, breathing power struggle in an otherwise disappointingly empty world. It alone makes the game worth playing."
2014,Middle Earth,"But this invigorating combat and intriguing enemy hierarchy system exist in an empty-feeling world, and not even the lovingly written lore in the game¡¦s appendices can inject much personality into Mordor."
2014,Middle Earth,"Shadow of Mordor is really cool to play and introduce an interesting Nemesis System mechanic, but at some point it becomes a little bit too repetitive."
2014,Middle Earth,"This carefully designed, constantly evolving, and weirdly dynamic army of Orcs ¡V especially those strong enough to repeatedly defeat me (more on that in a bit) ¡X is what made me keep playing Shadow of Mordor through to the end, even as I felt growing dissatisfaction with the game¡¦s stillborn and often threadbare narrative."
2014,Middle Earth,"Ultimately, like many ambitious projects, Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor doesn't deliver on everything it sets out to do."
