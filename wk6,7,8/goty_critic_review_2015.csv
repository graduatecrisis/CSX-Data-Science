2015,Bloodborne,Bloodborne takes the best of Dark Souls and builds the unrelenting gaming challenge on a prefect foundation - it will test your abilities to the max. The first true must-have exclusive for PS4 is here. [Issue#252]
2015,Bloodborne,"Brutal, Repulsive, Revolting and Irresistible. Could be an acrostic like BRRI but it ain¡¦t. It¡¦s Bloodborne."
2015,Bloodborne,"A dazzling work of dank, abject horror that cements Miyazaki as one of the all-time greats. Sixteen months after PS4's launch, the new generation has finally begun. [May 2015, p.112]"
2015,Bloodborne,"Whereas Dark Souls 2 felt to me as if it was laboring under the weight of its forebears, Bloodborne feels like the swaggering culmination of them. From Software has, in the best possible way, brought the evil back."
2015,Bloodborne,"Bloodborne is intricate, deep, rewarding and terrifying all at the same time."
2015,Bloodborne,"There¡¦ll be times when you feel genuinely lost, frustrated and unsure of your next step. But you will carry on, you will beat it, and when you do, there¡¦s no other game that can make you feel more elated about doing so."
2015,Bloodborne,The sum of its features produces a complex yet accessible gameplay experience that is amazing pretty much in every aspect.
2015,Bloodborne,"Combat aside, Bloodborne is a visionary work by a visionary artist. Intense in both theme and application, it's a gory concession to the tastes of the modern mainstream player, while maintaining the spirit and uncompromising narrative that was the hallmark of the Souls games at their finest. But this is far more consistent in that application than those games, making it From Software's finest work to date."
2015,Bloodborne,"It¡¦s the perfect marriage, blending mechanics that seem easy to learn with gameplay and challenge that demands mastery and ingenuity. It¡¦s a creative and technical masterpiece, rife with ability and potency."
2015,Bloodborne,"Its elegance, precision, humour, and challenge make Bloodborne irresistible. Ultimately, the horror is secondary; wonder is the true transfusion on offer here."
2015,Bloodborne,"Bloodborne is one of those experiences that totally consumes you when you're involved in it and working to see all that it has to offer. In that sense it's the digital edition of a round-the-world trip to foreign continents, each turning of a corner providing equal helpings of excitement and trepidation. That recipe brings it own rewards by simply being a part of it, the seemingly effortless delivery indicative of a design team and philosophy that is only getting sharper."
2015,Bloodborne,"Bloodborne is an immensely intricate and tightly-designed game that arguably surpasses what From have produced before, thanks to a handful of new ideas and tweaked mechanics. A system that promotes repetition to refill your consumables, and a difficulty that encourages level grinding in the opening few areas and at various intervals throughout feel like minor missteps, but they¡¦re tiny ones at that. Despite a few minor performance issues, Bloodborne is an epic, compelling, heart-pounding triumph."
2015,Bloodborne,"I want to keep playing, I want to discover its secrets, I want to fight every monster, try every weapon, discuss theories and explore as many of the community dungeons as possible. To put it bluntly, I want to bleed the game dry."
2015,Bloodborne,"It is true that some players may feel that making any progress is far too difficult, I felt the same way when I began playing, but trust me this is not a game you want to skip. Don't be scared to try it, Bloodborne is a wonderful addition to the PS4 library and I cannot recommend it enough."
2015,Bloodborne,"Bloodborne is something truly special ¡V a barbaric horror RPG that will giveth and taketh away in perfect measure, wrapped up in a perverse world that will refuse to let you go."
2015,Bloodborne,"Bloodborne succeeds through sparse storytelling, lush atmospheres (conjuring up notions of the best of Lovecraft¡¦s work), and tight combat that forces you to be aggressive. While this new IP doesn¡¦t stray far from the established Souls franchise, it is a magical, wondrous work that admirably instills both terror and triumph in those brave enough to delve into it."
2015,Bloodborne,"Between the expansive story, PvP, Chalice Dungeons, the significantly harder new game plus mode, and the countless number of secrets, Bloodborne seems almost limitless. Yet breadth wouldn¡¦t matter if the game wasn¡¦t so captivating. Several moments had us in awe, making us feel things we haven¡¦t felt since the original Dark Souls. Whatever it takes, find a way to join the ranks of the hunters."
2015,Bloodborne,A new masterpiece on PlayStation 4.
2015,Bloodborne,"If you take the time to really get lost in the game, you¡¦ll feel the pride and love that From Software has poured into it - and maybe at the end of it all, you¡¦ll end up loving it too"
2015,Bloodborne,"Sometimes things will be tough; you may even swear you're done getting stomped by a cruel and uncaring game, yet you'll inevitably find yourself picking up that controller again, steeling your resolve, swearing to push through the pain to snatch that next triumphant moment of victory from the slobbering jaws of the dark beast we call Bloodborne."
2015,Bloodborne,"From Software did it again - they have created a demanding, satisfying and superbly designed game. Some ideas are well known but the whole package feels original and unique. There are some minor issues here and there and still they don't bother the player. Bloodborne's world pulls you in with blood, new technology and a great artistic vision. A truly excellent game."
2015,Bloodborne,"From Software reinvents the gameplay we love from Dark Souls with Bloodborne, and delivers the best game on the PlayStation 4 yet. Except for the loading times there is no reason not to give this amazing game a try."
2015,Bloodborne,"Bloodborne allows us to experience the gravity of a world in decay, without losing the goofiness of ragdoll physics and pulling a whole arsenal out of our pockets. Just the impeccable gameplay and the excellent art direction makes this game one of the best in this decade."
2015,Bloodborne,"PS4 gets a must-have with Bloodbore. Not technically brilliant, nor seamless when it comes to frame rate. However, there isn't another game as astonishing in its artistic work, as well as making us feel things like fear, being powerful, getting frustrated, aware of dangers and, finally, achieving the ultimate satisfaction. Bloodborne means all that... and much more."
2015,Bloodborne,"FromSoftware has a unique style when creating incredibly well-designed worlds. The new offensive combat system gives a fresh start to the series, and while it is more direct in its conception, it doesn¡¦t lose an ounce of depth."
2015,Bloodborne,"Bloodborne is easily an early contender for game of the year, and it's the best PS4 exclusive to date."
2015,Bloodborne,"Do you miss From Software? If your answer is ""yes"", they come back with a classic. A perfect gameplay experience, gothic/crazy art design and satisfying difficulty level... Miyazaki did it again."
2015,Bloodborne,"Bloodborne takes what made Souls amazing in the past, and infuses it with speed, risk-reward play, and a haunting atmosphere. Only a few technical hiccups hold back a masterpiece from Miyazaki and From Software. This is a must-play game for any PS4 owner with a masochistic side."
2015,Bloodborne,"I started Bloodborne scared and unsure, quaking in my boots every time a new enemy showed its ugly face. I was horrified, timid and alone. But now, I have a confidence and strong sense of self. I am a hunter in Yharnam. I'm confident in my abilities, I know my weaknesses, and I trust my instincts. There's a real bloodlust that builds up in you once things start to click. You'll want to hunt, you'll want to kill, and you'll thirst for blood to make you more powerful. I find Bloodborne intoxicating, and I trust you'll find the same should you let it get into your system."
2015,Bloodborne,"Though built on the same core as the Souls games, Bloodborne marks the largest departure from the status quo to date. The numerous changes, many in service of a faster and more aggressive playstyle, might not be for everyone, but if you embrace that shift, you might well have a new favorite in the From Software canon."
2015,Bloodborne,Bloodborne is an undisputed revelation.
2015,Bloodborne,"The game is exactly what Souls fans have been hoping for in this new generation of consoles. It¡¦s gorgeous, terrifying, relentless and highly addictive. There¡¦s so much depth to this game that it¡¦s impossible to go over everything, and there will be many surprises in store over the next few months as swarms of Hunters descend on Yarnham and explore its twisted alleyways and endless secrets."
2015,Bloodborne,It may seem impenetrable at the beginning but Bloodborne rewards perseverance and dedication.
2015,Bloodborne,"With aggression as its invitation, Bloodborne invokes a calculated shift in Souls parlance. Its aim isn't necessarily a course correction, but rather a Y-axis slant into an alternative series of objectives. Sacrificed are a few degrees of personal customization, only to be replaced by a renewed sense of distress and wonder. Bloodborne¡¦s demanding novelty, even with its unrepentant focus, feels built to last."
2015,Bloodborne,"Challenging, beautiful and deep, Bloodborne delivers a great experience that, even though reminding of other games made by From Software, is also unique in its own right. Bloodborne is like a wonderful nightmare you won't want to wake up from."
2015,Bloodborne,"Bloodborne is a fascinating journey that is poetic, disturbed and potentially infinite."
2015,Bloodborne,"Bloodborne has a lot of similarities with Dark Souls, but it will surprise you as you will need to make changes to survive Yharnam. Without losing depth, this game offers a high gameplay speed. We enjoy the great level design, the subtle story and the city. The only issue we have encountered were frame rate drops and long loading times."
2015,Bloodborne,"Bloodborne tests your patience, your frustration and even your sanity while you play it, but it gives you so many things in exchange that it's always a pleasant experience. Add some of the best art direction and level design that you have ever seen and you've got the first must-need exclusive for PS4."
2015,Bloodborne,Bloodborne is a true sight to be seen and a real joy to play. It isn¡¦t as comprehensive as its predecessors but it¡¦s still an easy recommendation to anyone that¡¦s ever enjoyed a Souls games.
2015,Bloodborne,"Forget the excruciating loading times and the grumpy framerate: Bloodborne is a wonderful game. Period. Every PS4 owner should go and buy it, no question asked. It requires an utter devotion to the cause, but it repays the player like no other game does. As they say, blood will out."
2015,Bloodborne,"Bloodborne offers a new point of view in the Souls franchise with a great offensive combat system, polished gameplay and full of frantic moments. Great level design, good visuals and brilliant OST for the first big PS4 exclusive."
2015,Bloodborne,"The hype is real - From Software did not disappoint. Bloodborne is amazing, and easily the best triple-A exclusive on PS4 so far. Come have a horrible time in Yharnam with us. [Issue#256, p.65]"
2015,Bloodborne,"Veterans of From Software games may find Bloodborne a tad too easy, as it lacks input hiccups, weird hitboxes and other oddities that noticeably raised the difficulty in Souls-series games. [May 2015, p.62]"
2015,Bloodborne,"There¡¦s an incredible power to unlocking its mysteries, and in succeeding, despite its demand for a pound of your flesh."
2015,Bloodborne,"Visually striking, nerve-shredding and a fascinating streamlining of the Souls formula. Bloodborne is an exclusive jewel in the PS4 crown and you need to own it. [June 2015, p71]"
2015,Bloodborne,"What a world. What a combat system. What a game. You don't want to miss this. [June 2015, p.56]"
2015,Bloodborne,"It offers unparalleled player agency when dealing with From's wonderful third-person combat. [May 2015, p.79]"
2015,Bloodborne,Quotation forthcoming.
2015,Bloodborne,"Bloodborne is complete, distinct, and excellent."
2015,Bloodborne,It is still enriched with the uniquely mysterious touch of Miyazaki and From Software and that is all that it really needs to be.
2015,Bloodborne,"Bloodborne is an incredible game; tight in its mechanics, logical in its systems, rewarding, intense, gloriously frustrating and exciting in equal measure. The PS4 has its first absolutely essential game. As if there was ever any doubt."
2015,Bloodborne,"Bloodborne is a sterling example of what can be achieved with the latest technology while also recalling an older, simpler time, where a game¡¦s actual structure, gameplay, and content took precedence over its potential profitability."
2015,Bloodborne,"Killing a boss is more rewarding than in other games out there, because you know how much practice went into that effort. I enjoyed Bloodborne as much as I have enjoyed the Dark Souls games. That means it kicks ass."
2015,Bloodborne,"It's knuckle-gnawingly difficult at times and would rather spit in your eye than point anything out for you. But fending for yourself in the incredibly well-designed environments is a rewarding, empowering and yet humbling experience that gamers will talk about for years to come."
2015,Bloodborne,"Bloodborne is both perplexing and awe-inspiring, a challenging but rewarding title that will absorb or repel with equal strength."
2015,Bloodborne,"From start to finish, Bloodborne revels in its unique ¡V if somewhat masochistic ¡V approach to entertainment. There are very few games that cause you to curse their developer one minute and sing their praises the next ¡V but this is one of them. It is, quite simply, a sensationally designed and superbly refined offering."
2015,Bloodborne,Bloodborne has all the flavors and trimmings From Software fans have come to savor.
2015,Bloodborne,"Challenging, intriguing and extremely dark... Bloodborne is an experience that nobody should miss out on. A masterpiece."
2015,Bloodborne,"You¡¦re going to die a lot and become extremely frustrated more often than not. I can say Bloodborne is an experience that I will never forget as its combat mechanics, especially its transforming main weapons, helped me to adapt to the task at hand and I will gladly continue adventuring through in order to witness everything Bloodborne has to offer."
2015,Bloodborne,Bloodborne takes nearly everything that was great about the other Souls games and makes it even better.
2015,Bloodborne,If you have a PS4 you should definitely give Bloodborne a try. The game was super fun all the way through its 40+ hour campaign and I'll be playing it for quite a while longer to try to do just about everything.
2015,Bloodborne,Mijazaki¡¦s return to the Souls series is fabulously scary and challenging as usual. Horror atmosphere will haunt you pleasantly and new action concept will nail you to the screen. It¡¦s a truly unique experience given to the PS4 owners by From Software.
2015,Bloodborne,Quotation forthcoming.
2015,Bloodborne,"This nightmare is challenging, scary, and easily one of the best games I¡¦ve ever played. Both fans of From¡¦s previous work and newcomers alike should really give this a shot, and see what you¡¦re made of."
2015,Bloodborne,"The gameplay will not be for everyone, with the difficulty and repetition a potential turn off, but if you are looking for a new challenge, Bloodborne is a fantastic choice."
2015,Bloodborne,"Bloodborne is the kind of game that keeps you engaged with it long after you put it down, haunting you with a unique mix of hope and hopelessness, flaunting your own shortcomings and provoking you to overcome them through constant struggle, at the end of which awaits only more dread."
2015,Bloodborne,"Bloodborne is some of the best work From Software's ever done, a remarkable achievement and a shrewd turn from its Souls lineage."
2015,Bloodborne,"Refreshingly, Bloodborne knows what it is, and doesn't stray too far from the Souls formula¡Xbut its few alterations make for a fresh experience that will challenge even the most hardened Souls veterans. If you're looking to justify the purchase of a PS4, I can't think of a better reason."
2015,Bloodborne,"Bloodborne is built on this transcendent love. A love of the crumbling ruin, of the screeching banshee, of the shape in the shadows whose eyes catch the candlelight. A love of heaven-scratching spires, ever-descending staircases and fog-cloaked alleys. A love of all the magnificent horrors that have filled the minds of humans since they learned to light fires to stave off the dark."
2015,Bloodborne,"This act of death and rebirth is the only thing Bloodborne directly teaches users, as it's the game's main hook."
2015,Bloodborne,"Whether it's an accomplished dream or a recurring nightmare, spending a bloody night will never have the same meaning, particularly for mere mortals."
2015,Bloodborne,"With a nearly perfect combination of level design, gameplay, storytelling and a challenging experience, studio From Software delivers a package deal. This game might not be successful for Souls-fans due to its scale and limited gameplay options."
2015,Bloodborne,"With Bloodborne, From Software creates a masterpiece that will make it into the PS4's hall of fame. This new RPG is simply one of the best games we've ever came across thanks to a great gameplay, a vicious difficulty and a great artistic sense."
2015,Bloodborne,"Bloodborne is exactly what we where expecting. Hard, with a perfect atmosphere and as challenging as few other games in the market. You'll need to want to love him, but in return your love will be eternal and immortal."
2015,Bloodborne,"A dark and engaging adventure, with an excellent combat system, an ideal dose of innovation and fascinating exploration."
2015,Bloodborne,"Bloodborne offers countless hours of entertainment, and comes with an even darker tone than the Souls series. It may take some time to get used to, but in the end this is one of the best Playstation 4 games so far and a milestone for the action genre."
2015,Bloodborne,"One of the best action games of the generation and a stunning achievement in terms of gameplay, art design, and encouraging players to push themselves beyond their limits."
2015,Bloodborne,"The one blemish are the abhorrent loading times, which is a shame as they¡¦re simply an optimization issue rather than a design one. Expertly crafted on practically every level, Bloodborne is a deviously delicious experience that deserves to be experienced by anybody valiant enough to conquer it."
2015,Bloodborne,"Bloodborne is a conglomeration of hallucinations, violence and anguish, which has the courage to break away from the series that gave it birth to give players an experience as sick as exciting, challenging and rewarding."
2015,Bloodborne,"It's exactly what Miyazaki and the rest of his team promised. A dark, sick universe where you'll be constantly spiraling. It has courage, as it takes the legacy of the Souls saga in a new direction, it has an unique Victorian style, and it has one of the most impressive settings ever, as Yharnam will really stick with you. It isn't perfect, maybe rough around some technical and online edges, but it's still the quintessential action RPG of the modern age."
2015,Bloodborne,"Despite the manner in which it will punish and abuse you, Bloodborne will have you crawling back to it and saying,""Thank you, sir, may I please have another."" It's a gorgeous and dreadful world that sucks you in, and then kills you. Beautiful in every single aspect of the game and sense of the word, this progression of the Souls franchise is more accessible and addicting than ever."
2015,Bloodborne,"While the load times are a pretty big bummer, it doesn't change the fact that Bloodborne's combat is sublime, its challenge is second to none, and its world is unforgettable."
2015,Bloodborne,"An invigorated spirit occupying a reassuringly recognisable body, Dark Souls¡¦ life force flows through Bloodborne¡¦s revitalised veins. Intelligent and intense, it's simply PS4¡¦s best exclusive game."
2015,Bloodborne,"Give it a chance ¡V not just a couple of hours, mind, but five or ten; enough to let its claws sink in nice and deep ¡V and you¡¦ll probably find Bloodborne an intoxicating dose of pure masochistic pleasure."
2015,Bloodborne,The PlayStation 4 finally has its exclusive killer RPG.
2015,Bloodborne,"Those that are up for the challenge of Bloodborne are going to find a game that plays better, looks better, and has more to keep you occupied than any of the Souls games had."
2015,Bloodborne,"Bloodborne is an interesting mix of everything From Software has learned throughout its storied developmental career. Not everything will gel with fans old and new, but for the most part, the shift towards a combat-oriented game is a net positive. From Software is still one of the only developers left that makes you work for your satisfaction, and Bloodborne is damn satisfying."
2015,Bloodborne,"Only Bloodborne would be so bold as to bury an entire factional player-versus-player mechanic within an optional region, which is in turn buried within a series of oblique steps you might miss if you aren't exploring every nook and cranny, or ignore the game's enigmatic hints. I finished Bloodborne in less time than I did Dark Souls II, yet I treasure it more in spite of its few missteps."
2015,Bloodborne,"It¡¦s one of the best action RPGs I¡¦ve ever played. It¡¦s brutally difficult, but never cheap, and it¡¦s one of the most atmospheric games in recent years. If you fancy hard games, if you love a good deep RPG that doesn¡¦t hold your hand, then you owe it to yourself to play this one. It¡¦s a shame it¡¦s only on the PS4, but frankly, Bloodborne is worth buying the system to play."
2015,Bloodborne,"Bloodborne lends heavily from its forebears, but transforms the combat into a fast-paced dance of death. It rewards aggression rather than hanging back and waiting for opportunities to present themselves. While some technical, design, and pacing issues mar parts of the experience, Bloodborne is the freshest playing entry in a genre that has very narrow gameplay constraints."
2015,Bloodborne,Bloodborne is the system seller for all dedicated gamers that don¡¦t already own a PS4.
2015,Bloodborne,"It knows precisely what it is and strives to excel in every possible way. And in fact, Bloodborne does indeed excel in almost every conceivable category."
2015,Bloodborne,"A ferocious, fast and solid dungeon crawler, Bloodborne is a title of great quality and deep atmosphere, albeit limited by its lack of variety in terms of enemies, weapons and environments, frame rate drops and exhaustive loading times."
2015,Bloodborne,"A very good action game, but a weak Souls game ¡V and even From Software and Sony were referring to Bloodborne as a Souls game. It¡¦s got a solid basis ¡V mixing Dark Souls¡¦ it¡¦s-gonna-be-hard-but-it¡¦s-worth-the-pain character with faster pace ¡V but it¡¦s dragged down by some technical issues (e.g. loading times and framerate instability) and dubious gameplay design choices. [05/2015, p.60]"
2015,Bloodborne,"Bloodborne is, overall, one of the best games I've ever played. There's no small amount of genius involved in taking a winning formula and skewing it into something which is similar but distinct in a way which forces players to relearn a game system they already fundamentally understand."
2015,Bloodborne,"Bloodborne is a significant evolution of the Souls series, but it comes with some new problems too."
2015,Bloodborne,"Bloodborne is the next step in the Souls series, and the new, faster combat system opens up some new ideas and scenarios. For those that never could grasp the series, this new entry is not going to change your mind."
2015,Bloodborne,"This is probably my new favorite title of next-gen consoles, but then again I could have just become assimilated to enjoy the pain. Now I just have to figure out if I should say thank you or just sit quietly until my next punishment."
2015,Bloodborne,"Though not as refined and freeform as some of its predecessors, it continues in the longstanding Souls tradition of lending credence to challenging games and making the seemingly Sisphyean task of conquering ruthless, malformed monstrosities possible and downright commendable."
2015,Bloodborne,"In its current state, it feels like it caters too much to the twitch experts, and doesn't bend for the rest of us. A challenge that feels like a learning experience is welcome, but Bloodborne too often felt like it was kicking me in the balls and leaving me helpless to do anything about it."
2015,Fallout 4,"If traveling through Bethesda's version of Boston for 60 hours has taught me anything, it's that the little things are what matter."
2015,Fallout 4,"If you¡¦ve been waiting for Fallout 4, it will simultaneously meet your expectations and exceed them in others. Who would have thought a Fallout game would convince us of Bethesda¡¦s storytelling and shooter credentials? In a year full of brilliant open-world games like The Witcher 3, it manages to stand apart from the crowd and deliver something that feels fresh, despite its familiar foundations."
2015,Fallout 4,"Graphical niggles aside, Fallout 4 feels like a culmination of the fantastic work Bethesda did on Fallout 3, New Vegas and Skyrim, surpassing them all in terms of scope and scale."
2015,Fallout 4,"With those issues and caveat, Fallout 4 has to be the most addicting and content heavy-game we¡¦ve played on the Playstation 4. Looking forward to spending many more countless hours exploring every nook and cranny of the Commonwealth."
2015,Fallout 4,"A huge game that's anything you want it to be. An immense RPG, shooter, and world to explore that is only constrained by your imagination and desire to explore."
2015,Fallout 4,"Fallout 3 was seven years ago. Fallout 4 is one you can play, off and on, for the next seven. Congratulations, Bethesda: You¡¦ve outdone yourselves again. You¡¦ve made the Wasteland more beautiful, ugly, open ended, funneled down, thoughtful, and frantic than ever."
2015,Fallout 4,"Fallout 4 is another amazing achievement from Bethesda Studios. It encompasses the beauty of its brethren, while introducing a bigger, better world for gamers to explore and reside in. It¡¦s everything people were expecting, possibly a bit more."
2015,Fallout 4,"With its vast open world and its endless possibilities, Fallout 4 is a must have for RPG fans."
2015,Fallout 4,"Bethesda brings us one of the best games of 2015. It will be the game of the year for many people, for sure. It offers an incredible amount of game options, length, fun and gameplay possibilities but, most of all, it offers a ""real"" world to live in for the coming months."
2015,Fallout 4,"What I can say is that Fallout 4 is a wild ride that gets its hooks in you deep, with a number of welcome improvements and a settlement management system that could be its own entirely separate game. All that, and not a single microtransaction in sight, despite the game being easily structured for such a horrible business practice to slide right in. That is impressive."
2015,Fallout 4,"Fallout 4 captivates with a hauntingly beautiful apocalypse and refuses to let go. Exceptional gameplay is marred by a few flaws, but the Wasteland¡¦s flaws have never been fewer."
2015,Fallout 4,"Great new reasons to obsessively gather and hoard relics of happier times, strong companions, and sympathetic villains driving tough decisions make it an adventure I¡¦ll definitely replay and revisit. Even the technical shakiness that crops up here and there can¡¦t even begin to slow down its momentum."
2015,Fallout 4,"Fallout 4 is the game you've been waiting for months (maybe years?), and it will provide you fun for weeks."
2015,Fallout 4,Fallout 4 is a marvelous post-atomic RPG with a lot of content and a perfect setting. It's sad that from a technical aspect it's extremely short of our expectations and it has a simple storyline.
2015,Fallout 4,Fallout 4 makes you say goodbye to the rest of the world and immerse yourself in its universe for hours and hours. Its powerful virtues compensate for its obvious shortcomings.
2015,Fallout 4,"Just like meeting an old friend. Like coming home after a long time away. That is Fallout 4. The best of the franchise comes back, as good as always, but with many interactive options. If you're looking for a game with the potential of lasting several hundred hours of pure amusement, Fallout 4 is your game."
2015,Fallout 4,"Feral Ghoul ugly in many ways, but beneath its iffy exterior beats the heart of one helluva great RPG. Get past the graphics deficiency, and the sheer thrill of Fallout 4¡¦s combat, crafting options, and exploring will hold your attention for months. [January 2015, p64]"
2015,Fallout 4,"While there may be bugs everywhere, it¡¦s hard not to be in awe of the extensive open world Bethesda have created with the Commonwealth. Streamlined progression, an improved narrative, and extensive customisation make Fallout 4 a serious contender to the RPG throne."
2015,Fallout 4,"Fallout 4 is a masterful production that features a wildly ambitious and nigh-on unparalleled scope. There¡¦s just so much to do that it often feels overwhelming, but this isn¡¦t going to stop the franchise faithful. In fact, I¡¦m sure they¡¦ll welcome the deluge of options, content, and endless exploration."
2015,Fallout 4,"Fallout 4 has its flaws, such as weak AI, a few annoying bugs, stiff facial animations and the occasional control problem. But it more than makes up for them with a beautiful post-apocalyptic world filled with well-constructed quests, interesting characters and mesmerizing locations. Fallout 4 tells loads of big and small bizarre, tragic and touching stories that stay in your memory and create a maelstrom dragging you in deeper and deeper."
2015,Fallout 4,"Complex, full of depth and infinitely customizable, Fallout 4 manages to stand above its glitches and odd subpar animations to be an experience well worth having."
2015,Fallout 4,The same loveable Fallout formula far outweighs bugs and directionless new systems.
2015,Fallout 4,"Fallout 4 may be an iterative step forward for the series, but it is every bit what RPG fans know, love, and expect."
2015,Fallout 4,"Fallout 4 contains a huge amount of content, with stand-outs as an interesting story, the renewed VATS-system and the ability to build settlements. Some graphical bugs, AI issues and long loading times keep it from reaching the top mark."
2015,Fallout 4,"The ambient soundtrack is stirring, well produced and adds to the overall experience."
2015,Fallout 4,"Fallout 4 has some flaws. But it gives to fans of the series and of Bethesda's RPG exactly what they want and need: an overwhelming open world in an outstanding universe, with great tools to progress and great freedom of choice. Very pleasant, very difficult to resist and very very time-consuming."
2015,Fallout 4,"For the last decade, Bethesda games have had similar issues, and it¡¦s getting harder to forgive. Somehow, in spite of everything, Fallout 4 consumed us. When we¡¦re not wandering the wastes, it overwhelms our thoughts as we ponder where to go, which faction to pursue, and what weapon to try next. Fallout 4 is flawed in very serious ways, but it¡¦s also the only thing we want to do."
2015,Fallout 4,"Even with its issues, Fallout 4 never fails to impress. It took the dead expanse of previous iterations and breathed a type of life that takes good care not to betray the experience fans have come to know and love."
2015,Fallout 4,"Whether or not players find other changes displeasing, such as the new dialogue system and its limitations, is likely going to depend on their personal relationship with the Fallout series. Newer players will probably never know what they're missing and are likely to have a fantastic time, while fans who have stuck around may be disappointed with the direction Fallout 4 takes."
2015,Fallout 4,Fallout 4 is a roaring response to criticism that the series has ignored its qualities as a shooter in favor of its deeper and stronger RPG roots. Nearly every design change in Fallout 4 poises the game as a more streamlined modern shooter with high production value across the truly open-world Commonwealth wasteland.
2015,Fallout 4,"Bethesda plays it surprisingly safe with the formula, but they also do a much better job with the story this time around, serving to elevate the game as a whole. While there's no denying that it can be a bit ridiculous at times, its sheer scope speaks for itself. Bethesda has succeeded in crafting yet another fascinating open-world RPG."
2015,Fallout 4,"The fact of the matter is, though, that this is more of the same, even if that 'same' has been pushed to new heights. If you hated Fallout 3, then there's not much to get you onside here. If you loved it, then you'll love this all the more, because of its differences as well as its similarities."
2015,Fallout 4,"Fallout 4 is a masterclass in open world design. Consistently engrossing and absolutely stuffed with intricacies, it's a title that'll keep you enthralled for hours at a time as you gradually unravel its desolate yet hopeful post-apocalyptic portrayal of Boston. Although it's let down by some disappointing frame rate issues, it's not enough to detract from what's otherwise one of the most atmospheric and beautifully brutal games on the PS4."
2015,Fallout 4,"Fallout 4 is an engrossing game that lures you in with mystery and the promise of adventure. Its wretched wasteland can be captivating, and you never know what odd person or settlement lies around the next bend."
2015,Fallout 4,"The look is not up to what is expected from a 2015 top production, but looking past it you can find a really addictive Open World RPG. Fallout 4 is as good as its predecessor, or even more: a must buy for every fan of the saga out there."
2015,Fallout 4,"Fallout 4 carries over a number of problems from the past, and some of the more streamlined changes end up hampering the experience - but despite all of that, it¡¦s a fantastic game that delivers one of the most compelling and addictive worlds this year."
2015,Fallout 4,"A thrilling, engaging, post-apocalyptic Boston awaits. Dark humor combines with a serious narrative that makes us think about the value of human life in this huge glitchy world that is barely contained within a game disc."
2015,Fallout 4,"Fallout 4 isn't just a sandbox game, it's a playground. It brings such joy to discover new areas and characters, or to create your own weapons."
2015,Fallout 4,"It's more Fallout. If you liked Fallout 3, you'll probably like this."
2015,Fallout 4,"There¡¦s a ton of things to do and remember in this game, and while I enjoy what it does, it never really explains much of it. It took me way longer than I wanted to actually learn how to build and maintain my bases, and the tutorial is minimal at best."
2015,Fallout 4,"Fallout 4¡¦s greatest triumph, and its one major point of evolution is in its storytelling, crafting a lengthy, unexpected ending and resolution that I will remember for years to come. It also remains one of the best games in existence for those who simply like to wander and explore and unearth long-buried secrets. But it struggles with archaic gameplay systems and an inflexible engine that anchor the game to the past for all the wrong reasons. Fans may enjoy more Fallout and a brand new map to explore, but this sequel will not be heralded as revolutionary or overly impressive this time around."
2015,Fallout 4,"It doesn't have the same impact that Fallout 3 had seven years ago, and there's no doubt about that. It's also less RPG and more action, especially when you look at how the combat system has changed, but that can work if you accept the evolution. Fallout 4 is a solid free roaming experience, vast and interesting to discover, but not a game that defines new standards for the genre."
2015,Fallout 4,"It's bigger and more detailed than its predecessor. The gameplay is streamlined, which largely seems to benefit the combat and exploration at a cost to the dialogue and non-combat elements. There are few things as fun as grabbing your pipe rifle and wandering into the Wasteland to find a new ruin to explore or a new settlement to create. Beyond the main plot, there are possibly hundreds of hours of things to see and do. Fallout 3 fans should find a lot to love here, and newcomers to the franchise will find a great place to start."
2015,Fallout 4,"A strong return for the franchise, boasting incredible customisation, a fascinating world and brutal yet brainy shooting, slightly tarnished by lacklustre AI and tedious inventory management. [Christmas 2015, p.88]"
2015,Fallout 4,"The Wasteland has never been this beautiful. And it's never been this muddled and flawed. And maybe that's exactly how a Wasteland is supposed to be. This is Fallout 4, arguably the most anticipated game of 2015 - and a beautiful, elegant mess."
2015,Fallout 4,"Fallout 4 still has its issues, especially around glitches. Bethesda will probably never learn there (and, given sales and hype behind the game, Bethesda knows it doesn't actually need to learn). However, the game itself works by building a closer connection between player and narrative, and a settlement system that gives players a genuine excuse simply to live within a world."
2015,Fallout 4,"It¡¦s a bit rough around the edges in some areas and could do with a dab of polish. Regardless of these small faults, the stories told and discovered are fascinating and the Commonwealth is immensely interesting to explore."
2015,Fallout 4,"Fallout 4 is exactly and precisely more Fallout. Its couple of new gameplay elements are well-executed and enrich the experience, but they don't make this feel especially different than the Wasteland we were exploring almost a decade ago. If you enter looking for a heaping helping of the Fallout action you already enjoy, and an enthralling romp through a newly realized portion of the Wasteland, this certainly fits the bill. Just don't hope for another revolution, because like war, the Wasteland apparently never changes."
2015,Fallout 4,"Its technical faults and lack of innovation are frustrating, but the game underneath is as enthralling and compulsive as anything Bethesda has ever made."
2015,Fallout 4,"Fallout 4 is a bit of a mixed bag. While it¡¦s certainly enjoyable and I highly recommend it, I¡¦m not sure if this is the revolutionary Fallout title that we¡¦ve all been waiting for. It really feels less like Fallout 4 and more like Fallout 3.75. Longtime fans will definitely find a game they love here, without question (I do too), and newcomers will find a game that¡¦s a little easier to approach and equally enjoyable to get into."
2015,Fallout 4,"Fallout 4 is a huge, charming and deep experience, but it's too similar to Fallout 3. Seven years is a long time for videogames, and we can't believe that Bethesda couldn't make more changes to the formula in this time span."
2015,Fallout 4,Bethesda¡¦s team creates maps that are a joy to explore.
2015,Fallout 4,"Fallout 4 leans to the Shooting side of things. It strips down the gameplay from the actual RPG elements and offers a meta-nuclaer shooting gallery which of course keep its charm and gameplay wealth but also feels a little too friendly for the new comers. The Base builder mode is unnecessary, boring and irritating. Unfortunately, overall, there are no steps forward for this Nuclear Holocaust Behemoth of the video games industry. Only steps sideways."
2015,Fallout 4,"I can¡¦t shake the feeling I¡¦m really playing Fallout 3 season two. I guess it¡¦s time to acknowledge the elephant in the room: CD Projekt Red¡¦s masterful The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt this spring completely reset my expectation levels for storytelling, voice acting, pacing and congruous world design...There¡¦s nothing Fallout 4 does worse than Fallout 3, that much you can depend on."
2015,Fallout 4,My hype to see how Bethesda would interpret all these innovations and incorporate them into the Fallout setting turned to disappointment when I stumbled through a game that features the same poorly-implemented combat and all the same old Gamebryo engine annoyances and glitches we've been dealing with for years.
2015,Fallout 4,"There's a great game in Fallout 4, but how much of that greatness gets through to you is largely dependent on your own tolerance levels for those glitches and how willing you are to play another game from the same template as Skyrim, Fallout: New Vegas, Fallout 3, and Oblivion."
2015,Fallout 4,"Fallout 4, then, is a paradox, delivering in many of the areas that matter most but undermined throughout by poor combat, technical problems, and what feels like a lack of focus. So here we go again. It¡¦s not war, but Bethesda that never changes."
2015,Fallout 4,"The problem comes from the fact that this feels like more of the same, not a step forward. Fallout 4 doesn't break the same new ground Fallout 3 did with its jump to 3D, and its storytelling and intricacy of choice falls short of what New Vegas offered...Fallout 4 just feels safe, even when trying new things."

Super Mario Maker is thegame that the Wii U should have launched together with."

2015,Super Mario Maker,"Super Mario Maker is obviously the series' most creative experience, its limitations ensuring the fluidity of the process without hindering inventiveness, constantly stimulated by the community's sharings and competition. On top of being a pop icon, Mario therefore asserts the architectural influence of his universe on level design."

2015,Super Mario Maker,"It¡¦s Nintendo¡¦s love letter to the fans, not just giving them the tools to create and share Mario courses, but wrapping it up in a wonderfully presented package and teaching them everything they could possibly want to know.

2015,Super Mario Maker,"If Super Mario Maker was published between 2006 and 2008, it would have been revolutionary: now, with Little Big Planet and Super Meat Boy out there, it can't be innovative.

2015,Super Mario Maker,"Super Mario Maker makes it easy to create and easy to share your own 2D Mario levels. User created content is wild, uneven in quality and in best cases inspiring. [Oct 2015]"

2015,Super Mario Maker,"Super Mario Maker is a successful experiment that combines a great level editor with an endless stream of new content from the community. It turns out that the Princess is always in another castle, and the players will have to crawl through few million worlds to find her. Mamma Mia!"

2015,Super Mario Maker,"Super Mario Maker already has so much potential, but its true brilliance will only be apparent once it's out and it starts to create prodigies.

2015,Super Mario Maker,"Super Mario Maker makes creating levels an easy, effortless exercise ¡V letting true design shine through rather than hindering ideas by muddling with software. It¡¦s just a pity that it takes too long to truly wrestle that power from Nintendo¡¦s strict hand-holding."

2015,Super Mario Maker,"Trusting other players for quality levels is risky business, but making your own is creative heaven."
2015,Super Mario Maker,"For all its drawbacks in terms of relying on the gamer to actually put in the effort to enjoy the experience, Super Mario Maker is a fresh approach to the old 'RPG Maker' mould, taking the key elements that any 'build-a-game' title requires and then making sure that there are sufficient in-built goodies to give those less inclined to while away the hours making new content a sense of value for money."

2015,Super Mario Maker,Super Mario Maker is primarily an engine for circulating bad ideas and broken gimmicks as if there weren¡¦t already an overabundance of them.
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"The holy grail of world-building games, it¡¦s argued, is a black box that lets players do as they like with minimal handholding. Pliability with just the right measure of accountability. Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, a tactical stealth simulation wrapped in a colossal resource management puzzle inside a love letter to theatrical inscrutability, comes the closest of any game I¡¦ve yet played to realizing that ideal."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"Gorgeous. Massively replayable. Packed with an addictive Mother Base meta game. Even if you aren¡¦t a legacy fan, you¡¦ll enjoy this spectacular send off to the series. [December 2015, p64]"

I shake my head in disbelief that Kojima was able to top himself again and surprisingly brought a game of the year players will talk about for a long, long time. [Issue#256]"
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"A new standard for open-world interaction, and an incredible sign-off to a spectacular, often infuriating, series. This is one of the most ingenious, lovingly crafted games of all time."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,What you are getting with Metal Gear Solid V is hours upon hours of the vision of one of the most creative and artistic directors in video game history.
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"Hideo Kojima says goodbye to almost thirty years of work on his series in the best possible way. Phantom Pain surprises and tightens, impresses and even torments, but primarily entertains beyond all expectations. It is everything that the stealth game in an open world can be and demands the maximum effort and participation from the players."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"Maybe the most impressive thing about this already very impressive game is just how damn weird it is. MGSV is bursting with the kinds of bizarre little touches this series is known for but which you never see in the biggest games that cost tens of millions and take years to create, especially the ones in this genre."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"Though diehard fans intent on playing the same old Metal Gear may be upset with a few of the changes here, Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain stands as a crowning achievement for Kojima and one of this console generation's best games."

2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"I don't know if MGSVTPP is the best game ever, but it's certainly the greatest. It's too large in scope and design to inspire anything other than awe -- even Metal Gear haters can surely appreciate the majesty of the game."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain is the apex of the series and a fitting way for Kojima et al to bow out: as one, as best, as Big Boss."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"Massive, complex, challenging, deep, ambitious and innovative, Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is more than a mere video game, it's a life devoted to the medium. A game for the ages."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"Dear Kojima, thanks for giving us this sophisticated engineering machinery. Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is simply a revolutionary product and probably the best stealth game in recent years. It's not afraid of the sandbox genre, it draws a vast and open field full of hours of gameplay, freedom, unlimited fun and a constant desire to know what will happen next. Kojima, you are the real Big Boss."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"It¡¦s a shame that this will be Kojima¡¦s last MGS game, but for what it¡¦s worth he set aside whatever ill feelings he might have against Konami to create one of his most ambitious games yet. Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is the best entry in the franchise."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"Great, ambitious, funny and spontaneous, Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain will surely teach a thing or two to every developer in modern gaming."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"Incredibly, unbelievably, what we have here is a nearly perfect finale to the Metal Gear franchise. I truly believe that The Phantom Pain is where Kojima always envisioned he would take the franchise. This is personalized, open-world infiltration at its finest."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"Metal Gear Solid V will transcend videogame history as the best episode in the series; packed with tons of contents, a mature and dark tone, memorable characters, villains and final bosses, intense missions and packed with surprises. The Phantom Pain is Hideo Kojima's ultimate tribute to Metal Gear. A Hideo Kojima Game."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is not a game like any other. The kind of game that respects the intelligence of players, with almost complete freedom, without visible guide. Both giddy and capricious, he carried on his shoulders the heavy responsibility to end the saga. In addition to profoundly redefining the infiltration genre and changing its type of narration, it offers the best gameplay in the saga. At the time of the conclusion, more subtle and direct as usual, Hideo Kojima was able to speak to the players, and most importantly leave a unique legacy in the history of gaming. The kind of eternal diamond that will accompany you throughout your life as a gamer. Big Boss, thank you for this last trip."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"Perhaps MGSV¡¦s best quality is how in pulling gameplay to the foreground and letting much of the exposition remain optional, it opens it up to be enjoyed by people who have in the past been put off by its weirdness, serving as both the perfect entry point and a satisfying conclusion. MGSV takes the best of a great series and creates a series¡¦ best in the process."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"This isn¡¦t just the best Metal Gear game, nor is it just the best stealth game, it is one of the best games ever made."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"Kojima redefines the stealth-action genre showing a V for Victory. Good decisions, clear direction, deep gameplay, extremely polished... MGSV writes one of the most important chapters in the Metal Gear franchise."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"There has never been a game in the series with such depth to its gameplay, or so much volume in content. The best elements from the past games are here, and the new open-world gameplay adds more to love on top. When it comes to storytelling, there has never been a Metal Gear game that's so consistent in tone, daring in subject matter, and so captivating in presentation. The Phantom Pain may be a contender for one of the best action games ever made, but is undoubtedly the best Metal Gear game there is."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"There have certainly been sandbox action games that have given me a bigger world to roam, or more little icons to chase on my minimap, but none have pushed me to plan, adapt, and improvise the way this one does. Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain doesn¡¦t just respect my intelligence as a player, it expects it of me, putting it in league that few others occupy."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"MGS V: TPP is one of the best games we've ever played. No matter how high you're expectations are, it will go way beyond them. This is Kojima's masterpiece, and the worst thing about it is that it might be the last MGS with Kojima."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,Kojima's last addition to his legendary Metal Gear franchise is the greatest game he's ever produced. An undeniable pinnacle of the franchise and for video games in general.
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"The Phantom Pain is an incredibly polished and powerful experience. Kojima has gone 'all in' in the last chapter of his saga, and it paid off."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"The Phantom Pain is the Divine Comedy of videogames, the best stealth adventure to date and the GOTY 2015. A true masterpiece and a perfect farewell for the man who sold the world: Hideo Kojima."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"Metal Gear Solid V is the perfect evolution of the Metal Gear Solid franchise. The amount of freedom, customization and the FOX Engine are close to perfection. One of the best stealth games ever made."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,Is this truly Hideo Kojima's last game in the legendary MGS franchise? If so he will be sorely missed because this epic conclusion to the Metal Gear saga is a true video gaming masterpiece.
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"This. This is how you make sure the final chapter of a franchise delivers. A truly epic masterpiece, Metal Gear Solid V is Hideo Kojima signing off the only way he knows how: in style."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"The real story is the one you make yourself as you play through each mission, making new decisions each time and writing an action thriller of your own making. That¡¦s what makes Metal Gear Solid V brilliant, and that¡¦s why people will still be talking about it years from now."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"The Phantom Pain strays from the formula to perfect a new one, offering the best in open-world emergent gameplay we¡¦ve seen this generation. While the story sometimes falters under expectations, the characters, aesthetic, and polish of this game set it apart as one of the year¡¦s best."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"Phantom Pain is a game you can sink over 100 hours into and still come back for more. Even if you haven¡¦t played past Metal Gear games, Phantom Pain is a great place to start."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain might not be the perfect game, but it's as close as any title has ever gotten."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"Storywise we are not loving Metal Gear Solid 5, but we tend to forget about it when we play through tens of hours of challenging gameplay. This legend ends with a bang; Snake has never had so much freedom in such an immense world that keeps on surprising."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"A punch in the face, a huge gaming experience, a title with a nearly perfect gameplay and an adapted story-telling, eye candy and above all a wonderful Metal Gear: this fifth installment is a little bit of all that."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"A compelling, sprawling and often jaw-dropping experience that truly brings the franchise into the open-world setting for the first time."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"The most complete chapter on the Metal Gear Solid franchise. A deep and complete experience capable of providing a ton of hours of joy. Maybe it's plot is lighter than usual for a MGS, but that's a minor flaw on a masterly sea."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"Big Boss¡¦ supposedly final outing puts players in the middle of the most ambitious entry in the series yet, and it delivers on almost everything it promises. If this is Hideo Kojima¡¦s final game, then he is stepping out at the top floor of the industry."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is the masterpiece we all hoped it¡¦d be. It¡¦s undoubtedly the best game of 2015 and the generation so far and further solidifies Hideo Kojima as a master of the genre.
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"Metal Gear Solid V: Phantom Pain is a phenomenal game. It is a credit to its quality that some rather substantial flaws do little to drag down the game, and even with them, it's destined to be remembered as one of the best titles this year."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"The Phantom Pain is excellent. It expands and enriches Metal Gear Solid without compromising the qualities that make the series so beloved. Despite the huge scope, Hollywood talent, and technical flashiness, there¡¦s a subtlety to the Phantom Pain that¡¦s truly captured our hearts. Even now we¡¦re still turning its events over and over again in our minds. So rarely do game stories demand so much consideration. Decades later, it¡¦s incredible that Metal Gear can still captivate, inspire, and amaze."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"A series can¡¦t survive this long without evolving, and The Phantom Pain is a testament to the importance of taking risks. An open world, a customizable base, a variable mission structure ¡V these are not traditional aspects of Metal Gear, but they are what makes The Phantom Pain such an exceptional game."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"The Phantom Pain is an unusual Metal Gear experience, one that not everybody may enjoy if they cling to systems of old. If they¡¦re willing to adapt and accept this new way of exploring Kojima¡¦s world however, they are going to be blown away, absolutely, and one hundred percent guaranteed. This new open world is one that is begging to be played with, in whatever way a player wishes."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"There¡¦s no denying the Game of the Year potential of The Phantom Pain. The campaign is absolutely massive, it¡¦s almost too much to cope. That being said, Chapter II is a huge let-down and feels like artificial padding. Still, this is about as good as tactical espionage operations can get in a video game. [Oct 2015]"
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"Maybe not the finest Metal Gear, but certainly one of the finest games of this generation. [Oct 2015, p.60]"
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"If Kojima wanted to end his time with Metal Gear on a high note, he certainly pulled it off with Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain. Nice work indeed."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"If this is where Kojima does finally leave the series he created, it will be a bittersweet send-off, both for Big Boss and one of gaming's most intriguing auteurs."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"It's a game that subverts the basics of the Metal Gear Series. It's brilliant, unpredictable, gigantic, ambitious, awe-inspiring, vain and imperfect. This game is Kojima, basically, and it really reaches incredible heights during its first half. The second part, though, has obvious structural problems, and the narrative never really reaches the levels of the best chapter in the saga, even if the final plot twist is pretty brilliant. This Metal Gear will divide the fanbase, maybe even more than the second Metal Gear Solid, but it remains an amazing game."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"Kojima finally found the reasonable balance between gameplay and storytelling. The Phantom Pain is a game like no other and I would love to find a way to experience it for the first time again. [10/2015, p.44]"
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"By taking a step away from hours of cutscenes and codec conversation,and instead focusing on pure gameplay, Metal Gear Solid V is anunfamiliar but ultimately great and lengthy experience. It would havebeen nice with some more time spent on the characters and story, butit is a fair compromise with the new open world direction. Metal GearSolid V is a great evolution for the series and it is a shame that thenew direction will not reach its full potential due to Konami'sprobable withdrawal from the console world."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"If you compare it to the previous installments you might feel disappointed. If you compare it to the rest of the gaming industry, then you¡¦ll experience the ingenious excellence. The mixed feelings between an unfinished story and premium gameplay fail to ruin the greatness of what The Phantom Pain really is. But you won¡¦t be able to shake off the regret of great not being even greater."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"Mechanically superb, amazing to look at and offering as much MGS nonsense as players wish to indulge in. The Phantom Pain is everything we hoped it would be. [Issue#261, p.63]"
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"Still, I'm confident in calling Metal Gear Solid 5 the best game of the year, a vast undertaking where Kojima's reach hasn't exceeded his grasp, a game where a big story doesn't happen to you. Instead, you happen to it, slowly but surely. You may be surprised who you end up becoming."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"If this is indeed the final Metal Gear title from Hideo Kojima, he's gone out on an impeccably-produced high. Although the story doesn't match that of past games, The Phantom Pain's gameplay delivers in a way that only a select few open world games manage."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is the culmination of decades of an acclaimed series that repeatedly raised the bar with every entry. The storytelling may not please everyone, especially the initiated, but this is unquestionably the best gameplay in a Metal Gear game."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"Its finest tactical espionage action yet. [Oct 2015, p.104]"
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,Kojima Production¡¦s have created their magnum opus. A gem that has truly evolved the design of open world action.
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"As a game, The Phantom Pain excels. The stealth and action work beautifully in the open-world setting, and maintaining your Mother Base gives you plenty of rewards. It¡¦s long, fun, and gives players tons of variety. I just wish that the story offered more."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"In terms of its story, the fifth instalment in the series may leave some fans wanting more, but overall, the release proves to be a fitting, brutally brilliant finale to Hideo Kojima's beloved saga."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"Kojima has also done an excellent job of integrating this story into the well worn universe, wrapping up almost all of the loose ends within, as well as tying it to the events that are set to follow in a way that ought to please fans."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"You can be sad about some things in The Phantom Pain but everything becomes irrelevant in confrontation with superb gameplay and immense layers of freedom. Metal Gear Solid V is the most complex stealth game in history, one you can't ignore. What is more, the entry threshold is pretty low and MGS V should be very interesting even to those players that aren't familiar with the universe. Remember - it's a great stealth game but not a great MGS game."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain impresses at every turn. It's a vast and addictive game that manages to surprise even after many hours. Few minor bugs and repeatability are the only drawbacks. The final Metal Gear from Kojima is definitely worth recommending.
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"The game is a triumph in more ways than one, and while it¡¦s not without flaws, it¡¦s safe to say that Hideo Kojima and company have successfully adapted the core of Metal Gear Solid for an open world."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"This game is a painful goodbye for the series. In many ways this is the best Metal Gear game thus far, with unique details, multiple ways of succeeding in missions and nearly perfect stealth gameplay. But, the story is messy and it feels unfinished."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"I¡¦ve not had this much raw fun with a game in quite some time. It could have ditched the plot entirely and just thrown me into these environments with all the unique toys and I¡¦d have had a roaring good time. This is, to date, Kojima Productions¡¦ finest videogame if we¡¦re looking at it as a piece of pure, unabashed entertainment."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"To everyone who grew up with Metal Gear Solid, especially the ones who bought Zone of the Enders for the Metal Gear Solid 2 demo, Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is an experience that will never be forgotten. While it is sad that we may never see another Metal Gear with Kojima's vision, he gave us one hell of a goodbye. Thank you, Big Boss."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"It contains not only some of the best combat mechanics available, but everything you could have wanted from a Metal Gear Solid game. Plus Kiefer Sutherland."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"Metal Gear Solid 5 overstays its welcome a bit in the back half of the story, and F.O.Bs aren't much more than a fun novelty, but otherwise it's a stunningly enjoyable game that almost perfectly integrates a sizable open world environment with solid stealth fundamentals and a huge arsenal."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"The best Metal Gear Solid game ever made, as it bravely reinvents both its gameplay and its storytelling to far greater effect than ever before."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"If this is really the last Metal Gear Solid, it's an appropriate farewell. The story might be really slow to unfold, but there's a freshness in the gameplay that can appeal to newcomers as well."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"With a solid gameplay, an expanded version of the Mother Base and the powerful FOX Engine, Metal Gear Solid V delivers what it promised in a generation full of disappointing games and sequels. Despite a confusing story, The Phantom Pain is great game for everybody and a must-have for Kojima's fans."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"Despite the fact that I hit a few snags along the way, Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain feels like a simultaneous celebration of the series, and a decidedly new chapter. It's equal parts tough and flashy, and it's fitting that if this is Kojima's last Metal Gear, he goes on a high note."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"It feels like this was the game Kojima knew he should have reluctantly made from the beginning - having finally kicked the habit of falling into cinematic gluttony to tell his stories. He¡¦s made a game that utilises more fully what a game should, with all the learning curves that come with trying something new. Metal Gear Solid 5 is the best stealth game I¡¦ve ever played, it¡¦s just not the best open-world one."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"The Phantom Pain is an excellent title, albeit a little bit inconsistent. The gameplay is simply extraordinary, almost perfect, deep and bound to pave the road for the future of the stealth genre; at the same time, the plot is very powerful, but could have definitely been bolder and braver. Well, it's pretty clear that something went AWOL during the development of the game."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,Quotation forthcoming.
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is an exhilarating game to play that has massive narrative shortcomings.
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,Even after the second finale questions are left open ¡V questions that might not be answered after Hideo Kojima had to leave the franchise behind. But he also leaves an impressive piece of work as his legacy. It is not without flaws and the mission design relies a little too much on recycling. But the freedom you enjoy while on your missions is exemplary.
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"Phantom Pain is a celebration of R-rated power fantasies and even a light sprinkling of grindhouse sex and violence, not the least bit inappropriate for a game with an M-rating. Here¡¦s the only litmus test you need: if it¡¦s good enough for movies, it¡¦s good enough for videogames."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"You won't quite walk away from this Metal Gear shocked by its story in the same way as you did from, say, Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater...But the sandbox remains so addictive and complete that you never may walk away from this Metal Gear at all."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"It¡¦s a technical marvel, and is undoubtedly one of the best stealth action games ever made."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"The unfortunate truth is that its narrative fails to deliver a coherent and satisfying conclusion to the series, but as a stealth sandbox The Phantom Pain is peerless."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"It hardly matters that the game's mission objectives are redundant, given that the locations are so diverse and detailed...An impressive epic, even if it falls several steps shy of the open-world grandeur realized by The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"This kind of tortured melodrama feels like the best possible ending for Kojima¡¦s biggest failure. No matter how exciting, offensive, or incoherent some of his turns have been, there has always been something beautifully true to life in his willingness to try."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"The Phantom Pain is different. It, like its predecessors, wants to remind the player that war is, indeed, hell. But, in giving over to structural bloat it obscures the tremendous promise established in its opening hours, trading the narrative power of violent anguish for a routine, Sisyphean take on torment."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"It's kind of insane that the spiritual follow up to Peace Walker and easily the most ambitious Metal Gear title to date somehow winds up as arguably the least interesting entry overall, but there it is."
2015,Witcher 3,"The conclusion of Geralt¡¦s game saga couldn¡¦t be better. The large open world, great storytelling and dozens of hours of pure fun ¡V this game is an absolute must for every RPG fan. [Issue#253]"
2015,Witcher 3,"You¡¦ll not want it to end, just like you didn¡¦t want your very favourite RPGs of years¡¦ past to end either. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt will sit in that list now. There isn¡¦t any higher praise."
2015,Witcher 3,"Make some room on your hard drive and shelf, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt deserves a permanent spot in your gaming library."
2015,Witcher 3,"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt manages to constantly excite and amaze, with sublime storytelling and engrossing gameplay that never leaves you wanting more."
2015,Witcher 3,"Quality like this doesn't tend to arrive until way later in a generation, so we doff our caps to the team at CDPR for breaking tradition to deliver one of the best RPGs we've ever played. [Issue#247, p.60]"
2015,Witcher 3,It is a shining example of what RPGs should be: an experience that makes you believe that you¡¦re truly part of a game¡¦s world and that you have a very real stake in it. That¡¦s exactly what Wild Hunt has achieved here.
2015,Witcher 3,"The new benchmark for open-world Western RPGs on PS4. CD Projekt Red, we love the voodoo that you do in the Witcher 3. [July 2015, p70]"
2015,Witcher 3,"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is equal parts daunting, accessible, beautiful and hideous, but every aspect combines in such a remarkable way that it¡¦s nearly impossible to not give it a sweeping recommendation."
2015,Witcher 3,"Not only do you care about the characters and want to see how their stories end, but you want to scour every inch of The Witcher 3's glorious game world. It's a world you want to get lost in, a world where fast travel is an afterthought and a world you want to keep exploring in case there's something you've missed."
2015,Witcher 3,"Its shockingly cohesive world is as beautiful as it is demanding, and it's packed full of mature content that throws you from one emotional response to the next. Its storytelling is superb, its combat is grippingly refined, and its often unforgiving nature only lends itself to a brilliantly rewarding experience."
2015,Witcher 3,"The Witcher 3 is a triumph. CD Projekt has delivered a world that is epic and textured, and a narrative composed of swelling crescendos and artful asides. This is a studio at the top of its game delivering a title that¡¦s now at the top of the field. Quite simply, The Witcher 3 is unmissable."
2015,Witcher 3,"The way in which the developers manage to wrangle the various, divergent threads of your unique journey, with all of its composite choices and outcomes, while entirely concealing the seams is masterly."
2015,Witcher 3,"There is no saving the world, here, no great evil force pervading the landscape, or a doomsday clock ticking down to inevitable destruction, with only you to stand in its way. The story of Wild Hunt is a personal one, set in a huge and unrelentingly beautiful world."
2015,Witcher 3,"The Witcher 3 is a masterpiece, and in many respects simply the best and most exciting game in recent years. It captivates players with artistic vision, a huge world and an epic story. The developers were not looking for cheap applause - game design is uncompromising, consistent, thoughtful and nuanced."
2015,Witcher 3,"It¡¦s a story worthy of a place in the more accepted subculture of dark fantasy ruled across media by Game of Thrones. First-timers will easily love this facet but may also be surprised to learn that this series, and the books it¡¦s based upon, have been the at the fore of adult and mature storytelling for a long time. Wild Hunt is both at times brutal and sexy, with a juxtaposition of hard-edged steel (or silver), blood and death being met with soft, naked skin; passion, lust and even love."
2015,Witcher 3,"This game has got characters that you actually care about, a story that is very engaging from the get go and almost flawless gaming mechanics."
2015,Witcher 3,"One of the best role-playing games ever crafted, a titan among giants and the standard-setter for all such games going forward. Where the Witcher 2 sputtered to a halt, The Witcher 3 is always in a crescendo, crafting battle scenarios that constantly one-up the last, until you reach the explosive finale and recover in the glow of the game's quiet denouement."
2015,Witcher 3,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a perfect example of how studios should be developing videogames. CD Projekt Red presents us an epic adventure that works in every single way. Is hard to find the right words to do justice to this masterpiece that everyone must try.
2015,Witcher 3,"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a thoughtful, diverse, and frequently awe-inspiring adventure. Its stories are deep and satisfying, unafraid to touch on themes of personal character, presenting players with choices and consequences that aren¡¦t about turning into a hero or a villain. In the end, it¡¦s quite simply one of the best RPGs ever made."
2015,Witcher 3,"It stands out for its wonderful writing, variety of quests and things to do in the world, and how your choices have impact in interesting ways."
2015,Witcher 3,"The end of a fantastic journey, it_s an extremely ambitious game, a real tour de force that shows CD Projekt will continue to shine. Really big, dense, with a nice narrative pace that mixes well with the open world structure. A stunning game."

2015,Witcher 3,"The Witcher 3 presents a realistic, engaging, and dark fantasy world. With fast-paced combat, deep character customisation, and massive locations to explore, it's a game not to be missed."
2015,Witcher 3,"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is far more than a fantasy role-playing game. It¡¦s an amazingly fleshed-out world that rewards careful, thoughtful exploration. CD Projekt RED didn¡¦t just deliver on their promise to craft an open world worthy of author Andrzej Sapkowski¡¦s lore¡Xthey greatly exceeded it."
2015,Witcher 3,"A masterclass in open-world game design, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt packs every pixel of its gorgeous world with compelling fiction and believable, satisfying role-playing."
2015,Witcher 3,"An impeccable role-playing game, and one of the finest games ever created. Whether it's as large as tracking the Wild Hunt or as small as delivering a love letter, The Witcher 3 makes Geralt's actions count in the most incredible ways - creating a world begging to be explored for countless hours on end."
2015,Witcher 3,"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is almost perfect. There are a few flaws in the way and the game is not as demanding as it's predecessor, but the tsunami of content that keeps you busy is amazing. The world of the Wild Hunt is so much more than just a pretty picture."
2015,Witcher 3,"While minor design choices keep it from being absolutely perfect, The Witcher 3 will go down as one of the best games of this generation of consoles."
2015,Witcher 3,"It¡¦s simply bigger, more intense and with an amazing graphic design. The Witcher 3 is something every RPG player must play."
2015,Witcher 3,"The perfect farewell to one of the most important figures in the world of role-playing in video games, but hopefully not our last visit to this fascinating world."
2015,Witcher 3,"The Witcher 3 is a captivating game and a gorgeous title. Thanks to a very inspired artistic department, offering an even more accurate view on the gloomy world Geralt lives in, this third part proves itself as one of the most beautiful games ever made. But there is more: if CD Projekt took its game open-world, it's not simply for the sake of doing so. They handcrafted a very lively, very concrete universe in which you can enjoy your freedom to be the witcher you always wanted to be."
2015,Witcher 3,"The Witcher III: Wild Hunt is one of the best RPG games ever made. Its (main) story, excellent visuals, challenging quests and beautiful world makes this one of the best games in 2015."
2015,Witcher 3,An amazing amount of content and a great story with many possible choices and consequences work pretty well with The Witcher series¡¦ sandbox twist despite its numerous shortcomings.
2015,Witcher 3,"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is the best reason to make you buy a new console or a high-end PC. The new Geralt's adventure is huge, adult, surprising and always stunning. Everything we love about videogames."
2015,Witcher 3,"A strong contender to be called the best fantasy RPG of all time. Absolutely essential. [July 2015, p.60]"
2015,Witcher 3,"Wild Hunt feels like an old folktale. The story is beautiful, funny and creepy at the same time, dialogue and characters set a new milestone for other game writers. Witcher 3 could be one of the best games ever made: only the ending of the story and battle system could be better. [June 2015]"
2015,Witcher 3,"The Witcher 3 is an engaging, overwhelmingly lengthy gaming experience with a staggering amount of characters to meet and places to explore."
2015,Witcher 3,"No one can avoid their fate, especially if they happen to be a witcher with a very particular destiny. Of course, the end of this story depends on your choice between personal happiness and world¡¦s stability, duty and destiny, selfless love and mutual one ¡V but we all know what Sapkowski¡¦s Geralt would¡¦ve chosen. [June 2015,p.56]"
2015,Witcher 3,"RPGs have a new king with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. CD Projekt RED has turned Adrzej Sapkowski's work into an amazing interactive spectacle in terms of visuals, plot and gameplay mechanics. Every hour invested in this game will be an hour of fun. The only disappointment is the optimization of the game on PS4. Frequent frame rate drops blur the experience. An issue we expect to be solved with updates but, for now, are quite a burden while playing."
2015,Witcher 3,"The amount of content we find in The Witcher 3 is outstanding, as is its quality. It is true that there are some aspects with some room for improvement, but it delivers such a rich and unique universe that you will soon forget about them."
2015,Witcher 3,"This world doesn't need a hero, it needs games like The Wither 3. Be ready for an unforgettable experience and say Goodbye your social life."
2015,Witcher 3,"Even if the plot isn¡¦t terribly interesting, the many characters who play a part in it are, and along with the excellent combat and RPG gameplay, they elevate The Witcher 3 to a plane few other RPGs inhabit."
2015,Witcher 3,"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt isn¡¦t perfect (yet?), but it¡¦s one of the best written RPGs ever."
2015,Witcher 3,"Wild Hunt is a masterpiece of open-world design in which it feels like every last detail has had the same level of care, thought and attention paid to by the team that created the game. It is fascinating to explore, consistently rewarding, always engaging and cements CD Projekt Red¡¦s reputation as a studio to watch."
2015,Witcher 3,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is one of those rare cases of games that proves that the future of gaming lies in the past and the glory days of hardcore RPG gaming.
2015,Witcher 3,"The Witcher 3 is messy, highly emotional, and incredibly addictive. Barring any huge surprises this fall, The Witcher 3 should be a shoo-in for the game of the year ¡V it¡¦s not just one of 2015¡¦s best games, but for many players, it¡¦s the only one they¡¦ll need."
2015,Witcher 3,"Experience is earned largely through quests, not battle alone, which highlights CD Project RED's emphasis on thoughtful storytelling over mindless bloodshed."
2015,Witcher 3,"It¡¦s been a heck of a ride, with the story twisting and tearing my heart out every chance I gave it. Most of this heartbreak stems from the choices that I made, which is why I love this series so much. Even so, some of the simplified elements like potion crafting or combat left me wishing it had kept more of its legacy intact."
2015,Witcher 3,"Gigantic world, intriguing story, enjoyable combat and quest overload... that's The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. An action RPG fan's dream come true."
2015,Witcher 3,"If you're an RPG fan, you owe it to yourself to give The Witcher 3 a shot. It rivals the best that Bethesda and Bioware have to offer, and you'll be hard-pressed to find a better RPG this year."
2015,Witcher 3,"It's not the most artful, the most intelligent, or the most important, but it's certainly going to be the most spectacular. And I know for a lot of players out there, the spectacle is all that matters."
2015,Witcher 3,"The Witcher III: Wild Hunt is probably one of the most well-crafted RPG worlds yet...Is it perfect? No, the combat is rote at times and the inventory and crafting needs work, but in the end, The Witcher III is a top-notch RPG experience."
2015,Witcher 3,"Geralt is back and better than ever. A huge, beautiful world filled with adventure and improved combat mechanics makes The Witcher 3 a Game of the Year-contender."
2015,Witcher 3,"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is easily one of the most engrossing games I¡¦ve had the chance to play. The story and characters are well worth the experience alone, and the world expertly draws on the desire to explore with its massive scale."
2015,Witcher 3,"There are times when Wild Hunt just can't live up to its own development team's expectations, but for the most part, The Witcher 3 is an amazing experience."
2015,Witcher 3,"Even with these complaints, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is one of the best RPGs I have ever experienced in gaming. There¡¦s so much to this adventure, you¡¦d be missing out on a great experience if you pass it up."
2015,Witcher 3,"Every interaction is an intrigue. Not only is the dialogue superbly acted, but I can see every emotion the voice is trying to convey in each character¡¦s face."
2015,Witcher 3,"The Witcher 3 is one of the most hyped games this spring, but it's also one ofthe best. CD Project Red has managed to build a huge world that isboth interesting and entertaining to explore. Add to that a well-crafted combat system and good opportunities to customize your character."
2015,Witcher 3,"This role-playing marvel creates an impressive atmosphere in an open world, focusing on the silent moments and the exploration as much as on spectacular fighting. The quest quality is high throughout and the storytelling is out of this world ¡V not only for ten or dozens but for a hundred hours."
2015,Witcher 3,"Gorgeous, generous, incredibly well written and fun to play, The Witcher's story conclusion is far from a disappointment. It's an amazing open-world RPG, looking like Skyrim and Grand Theft Auto's child, offering so many wonderful and lively places to explore, so many tasks to accomplish, so many fantastic stories and characters, so many great battles to fight, that it will take hours to explore the entire thing. A solid masterpiece that you can't seriously miss if you like RPGs - and have plenty of time to play."
2015,Witcher 3,"A colossal achievement in technical terms, with a level of interaction with the game world and its inhabitants that is unsurpassed in modern video games."
2015,Witcher 3,"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is an awesome dark fantasy game, with perfect storytelling, a beautifully crafted world and powerful characters. Due to the open world structure and its huge dimension, this game has some technical issues, yet the final experience is still one of the best around for RPG lovers."
2015,Witcher 3,"When it comes to story, lore and characters, The Witcher 3 is simply stunning, a milestone in western RPGs. Although the gameplay is quite varied, and the offer in terms of quests and exploration rich, the combat system still lacks depth, and structure as questing never changes. As it is, it's a perfect game for whoever like to dive deep into a believable and vast imaginary world, but not for gameplay purists."
2015,Witcher 3,"Playing The Witcher 3 with an eye for grand strategy can be both a densely engrossing and mechanically frustrating, overlong adventure. When played one move at a time, however, Wild Hunt is the supreme alchemical distillation of the role-playing experience. It¡¦s a bleakly human play at the heart of a dark fantasy."
2015,Witcher 3,No other developer has brought an open world to life the way CD Projekt Red has here.
2015,Witcher 3,"If you¡¦ve ever wanted to become fully immersed in a fantastical universe with absolutely everything you could ever hope to have in an in-depth, unbelievably robust role-playing game, it¡¦s right here."
2015,Witcher 3,"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a great game, that is a fact. Its world is astonishingly huge, and it will keep everyone busy for months to come. The storytelling simply raises the bar for every other action RPG out there. Most of the flaws of the game are caused by its own ambition, and not everything can be fixed by a patch. Wonderful indeed, but not the masterpiece we were hoping for."
2015,Witcher 3,"The Witcher III has a compelling plot, combined with some old school, complex game systems that encourage exploration, crafting and experimentation. It has some rough spots, but when the plot and characters suck you in the way The Witcher III does, it¡¦s worth forgiving the unrefined aspects of the game for the expansive world and engaging, morally ambiguous storytelling."
2015,Witcher 3,"We¡¦re still left with a good RPG, but one that¡¦s held back somewhat by tedious quest design and an overreliance on sexist cliches."
2015,Witcher 3,"The Witcher 3 is much more sloppy and than expected, and the graphic quality of the Northern Kingdoms is a disappointment. However, the game is still so good that we accept these issues. This fantasy world is great, offers plenty of detail and keeps pulling you back in."
2015,Witcher 3,"Gigantic, with a majestic world, a brilliant narrative, great dialogue and characters, The Witcher 3 fails miserably when it comes to pure gameplay. Its simplistic combat system and repetitive quest structure are a monster that even Geralt cannot kill."
2015,Witcher 3,"The Witcher 3 is a game aiming for highest praise - you simply can't get enough of it. The need to see what happens next kept me glued to the console for many more hours than I had planned. Unfortunately the The Wild Hunt isn't perfect - the number of smaller and bigger issues can surprise (in a bad way, of course). It is an amazing game but right now the amount of bugs is simply too high."
2015,Witcher 3,"The Witcher 3's subject matter, its almost defiant doubling down on its treatment of women as titillating props for Geralt and the player, even as it tries to flesh out more female leads, is its most disappointing aspect. This constant presence weighs down what would otherwise be an excellent bit of closure for Geralt's video game saga ¡X which isn't helped by the control issues that often detract from sequences meant to break up open-world monotony."
2015,Witcher 3,"[CD Projekt's] reputation as a studio of remarkable technical prowess has been tarnished a little, however noble its intentions. [July 2015, p.98]"
2015,Witcher 3,"While the decidedly average combat and alarming number of technical gremlins are disappointing for a title that's been in development for so long, The Witcher III: Wild Hunt is still a must-buy title for genre fans."
2015,Witcher 3,"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a huge step up from its predecessor, mostly because it manages to tell a more compelling and personal tale. At the same time, that intimate feel is juxtaposed against a gigantic, sprawling open-world adventure that may hit some snags along the way but still comes out on top."
2015,Witcher 3,"Sloppy combat and ongoing optimisation can't quite spoil this dark fantasy adventure, set in a stunning world of blood and black magic."
2015,Witcher 3,"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a surprising failure as an open-world video game, but within its beautifully lit world of monsters lies a much more traditional story-driven RPG of immense quality."
2015,Witcher 3,"It spends a great deal of its energy trying to impress the audience with unparalleled scope. The result is an experience that succeeds in its mission of being a grand experience, but commonly missteps when it comes to fundamentals such as combat, leveling systems, and user interface design."
