Year,Game,Review
2014,Dragon Age,"I don't like this game I prefer the old days when a game was built to be a game. The whole idea behind rpgs are that they are fantasy based and you are given an opportunity to change your character into whoever you want then play through adventurous terrain. Nowadays the developers have forgotten what gameplay is and how important it is. Game studios now are as guilty as fast foodI don't like this game I prefer the old days when a game was built to be a game. The whole idea behind rpgs are that they are fantasy based and you are given an opportunity to change your character into whoever you want then play through adventurous terrain. Nowadays the developers have forgotten what gameplay is and how important it is. Game studios now are as guilty as fast food restaurants making good wholesome produces into more accessible counterparts of half the quality. Yes improvements have been made on next generation consoles to better graphics and a larger game world but the gameplay suffers from what it should be. Remember games like mass effect and the elder scrolls series? This is what people want an adventure where you can explore a world, be who you want, go where you want and do what you want and have some say how it plays out. Replayable games that make you want to try again with a new character. Next generation consoles have made great strides building better larger worlds with better hd graphics but developers have done a terrible job with gameplay and also software bugs which breaks all fantasy immersion and belittles the whole idea of rpg and fantasy.. This game is no different, nice world, nice visuals but gameplay omg boring. Somewhere some development team brought the whole idea of workplace attitude into games it shows. No longer are developers making fantasy adventures with rpg elements and building a story into that to make it that much better they are just copying every other game out there. This game is not an rpg fantasy adventure. I want to be harsh so people are clear on my complaint, this game should be called ""Dragon Age - Revenge of The Halloween Costume Party Scavenger Hunt Team"". Yes, that is how i see this game its an elaborate fetch quest not an open world rpg. This is my critique of a lot of games these days way to much focus on the world design and such a poor idea of what good gameplay is and what gamers really want. We want choices, random loot, a huge game world to explore and consequences play out differently. We want non linear areas, we want interesting lore and creatures, we want game play that will make us feel like in a fantasy world. Certainly we don't want portrayal of real life anywhere. We don't want cutscenes that make us feel we are watching some cheesy tv program nor do we want a checklist of things to look for. We want puzzles and lore to back up the puzzle. So much is missing from this game. Its a drone of every other lazy made game with nice graphics. I can't score it that high. I appreciate how much work went into filling up the software program but at the end of the day i don't see myself interested in invensting my time in a scavenger hunt i can just go to a pawn shop in real life if i want.\"

I found myself not wanting to turn the game off because i was having so much fun. When my friends get the game and we play it together we will have a blast. The single player is very well made. The graphics are really good for a game this large. There were some points during the cutscenes where the framerate dropped but it didn't bother me too much. The story is pretty interesting and has me wanting to continue getting deeper into the game. Combat is fun and the tactical element proves really useful in sticky situations. At one point I was out in the forest and had to tackle a group of enemies when we all had low health and no potions left. Had i just ran in attacking we would have died but using some tactics i was able to kill all the enemies without anyone dying. All in all this is a really solid game and if you like RPGs this is something you should really consider buying.\"
2014,Dragon Age,"Contender for game of the year. It's been a long wait, but man has it been worth it. Great battle mechanics, much to do (with purpose) and guess what? It doesn't fee grindy (say what?). This is because Bioware, does what it does well and offers solid STORIES. Not just a good main story, but hundreds of good side stories (so far). Thank you, Bioware!"
2014,Dragon Age,"So far this game is HUGE improvement over Da2 ,instead of having only one race in the last game now has gone up to 4 and instead of having a very small world like the last game this one on the other hand has a huge massive land to explore and the combat has been improved the story is also engaging so far.This is a must play for fans of rpgs and a return to glory for Bioware."
2014,Dragon Age,"1: At first I have to blow of some steam here...I own every Dragon Age and Mass Effect title with every DLC. And this game is another huge - monstrous really - letdown! I mostly play RPG\s. And Bioware know\s quit a bit about how to make a good one, or even a superb one.(granted, the ME series is more of a Shooter with an interactive Story because of the lack of complex combat1: At first I have to blow of some steam here...I own every Dragon Age and Mass Effect title with every DLC. And this game is another huge - monstrous really - letdown! I mostly play RPG\s. And Bioware know\s quit a bit about how to make a good one, or even a superb one.(granted, the ME series is more of a Shooter with an interactive Story because of the lack of complex combat options - But it is tons of fun. I enjoyed ME3's combat in particular very much. I think they nailed it in ME3\ )I became a huge Bioware fan with DA:Origins and began to question their sanity when DA:2 came out. It was the first video game which I literally threw in the bin, after playing it for about 15 hours. That thing had absolutely no resemblance to Dragon Age Origins to me. I felt used, to say the least. Back then I really thought, ""oh man, EA is doing this to them"". But after I have seen the combat system of Inquisition, I am free of that illusion\ince I enjoyed ME3 very much, I have high hopes for ME4. But since Dragon Age Inquisition, I no longer have high hopes (or any hopes for that matter) for the future of the Dragon Age series.I don\t take Bioware seriously any longer. Because I can\t!2: And I will tell this to Bioware:Guys, I still think your awesome and you have a lot of talent and passion. In the past I bought every Dragon Age and Mass Effect title with every DLC (honestly!). But, if you cut out or rather leave out complex systems, like the combat and skill mechanics of DA:Origins in future titles of the DA series - like you did here - you will have lost a paying customer forever! And don\t think for a minute, that any fan of RPG\s will take this sort of politics lightly! Complex systems, combat agency and a great freedom in character creation and party member configuration, is what lies at the heart of RPG gaming. Don\t insult us. And don\t try so hard to appeal to people who don\t play RPG\s. The only thing you really do, is making it harder for other companies to put out real RPG\s, because you water down the expectations of consumers.I guess my most diplomatic advice would be, to try and find a middle ground here. Make it possible for us to access all the skills via the radial menu and leave it optional for casual gamers to play an action game. Because this title is only partly a RPG! We want a broad variety of skills and more freedom to create. We like to create things from scratch and find our own solutions, our own approach to the game - YOU KNOW THAT!YOU ARE DESTROYING THE FOUNDATIONS OF YOUR DRAGON AGE SERIES!And me, as a RPG fan, I don\t want to buy or play oversimplified action games.3: Now for the rating...My rating for Dragon Age Inquisition goes about like this:A RPG really has two components:1. The story and the dialogue or social interactions.2. The combatFor each part I have 5 stars to give at maximum. Because they both are equally important in my mind.In DA:I I would give 4 of 5 for the story part. 1 of 5 for the combat.I feel the need to point out, that I really want to give them an extra star for producing wonderful games and for pushing hard and so on. But since the skill system and combat system is even more dumbed down then DA:2 - I clearly cannot. They just took a pair of scissors and cut out every bit of complexity they could find. Well thanks for that, Bioware!4: For my future considerations on buying a Dragon Age Game\(This is not effecting the Mass Effect series - so far...)First - It is very unlikely that I will trust Bioware ever again!Secondly - If Bioware does not put back in a complex combat system like DA:Origins had, in the next title - this series is nothing but a very poor memory of a typical consumer sin to me. That\s really all it will be. The reason I am so fed up with Bioware is, I have no real reason to even hope, that Bioware wants to fix these things. Even so they keep telling us. Which I take as a clear lie from them, at this point! I got lied to\ thats all! How stupid of me\¦Hope you enjoyed reading this review,a Bioware-Critic(I am a German living in Vienna Austria)\"
2014,Dragon Age,Great. Fluid. Combat.  Easily the best game on PS4 right now.  I plan on completing the game on nightmare and so far so good.  The prologue was great and I can't wait to see what comes next!
2014,Dragon Age,"This game is just awesome. Massive and complex story, amazing characters, a vast world to explore and that special ingredient that is present in all bioware games: The ability to induce strong emotions in the player."
2014,Dragon Age,"My first impression is just: WOW!!After all those Shooters and Sportsgames there finally is a decent RPG on the PS4 and a really, really good one...The graphics are awesome, character customization options are plenty, combat mode different of what you are known from other RPGs, but really really great and the Story seems to be pretty decent as well (at least the part that i  haveMy first impression is just: WOW!!After all those Shooters and Sportsgames there finally is a decent RPG on the PS4 and a really, really good one...The graphics are awesome, character customization options are plenty, combat mode different of what you are known from other RPGs, but really really great and the Story seems to be pretty decent as well (at least the part that i  have played so far).A must have for all the RPG Fans out there!\"
2014,Dragon Age,"I don't really understand all the negative about this game, i've put around 40 hours into Dragon age so far and I'm really loving this game, its honestly the best Rpg I have played since Skyrim. Maybe its just EA haters or something but its really a great and beautiful game well worth the 60 dollar purchase. IMO."
2014,Dragon Age,"I dont really think this game is that great. It really reminds me of Twilight Princess on the Wii.

Its a trivial time waster thats it. Like Twilight Princess the game looks fabulous and sounds fabulous but in my opinion the gameplay is rather boring and too much like going to work or being a systematic drone (game zombie). When I play a fantasy based rpg i expect to get lost in a world and have strange obstacles to overcome. My expectations are not to be given a list of things to do as if im at work and my employer wants me to get stuff done. To me that is not a game it is a checklist to occupy your time. This game is expansive and deserves a lot of credit for beautiful art and sound and a nifty inventory of stuff but the characters and how you occupy your time are not that great or interesting. This is my opinion you don't have to agree but I'd rather have a rpg fantasy actually be an rpg fantasy and this game is not that its stunning visuals and a list of things to do and after 100 hrs yeah you will probably be at the end of the discs software.\"
2014,Dragon Age,"Look at some of the reasons for the 0 and 1 scores. Hilariously childish.This game is amazing. A solid 9 without pause. The graphics (at least on the PS4 to a 50"" Plasma) are stunning, gameplay is fluid, fighting is however you want it (smash-mouth, or stop and plan every move), the voice acting is superb (stick with the English male, however) and RPG elements are everywhere.All ILook at some of the reasons for the 0 and 1 scores.

2014,Dragon Age,"One of the best RPG'S ever made. Gives Skyrim a run for it's money for sure. Amazing graphics, amazing story, and for the most part the game is extremely polished on the PS4 considering how massive this game is in size. Incredible! Well done Bioware!"
2014,Dragon Age,"Anyone who gives it a 0 or 1 is a troll. This game is incredibly detailed. Graphics look great. Controls take a bit to get used to, but work plenty fine. A ton of customization, lots of choices. In 4 hours of playing, I have already seen my choices make an impact on the game. I would say this is game of the year. Awesome game, have loved playing it."
2014,Dragon Age,"I haven't yet finished this game but I have a feeling a lot of the people giving reviews here haven't either. With that said I believe a lot of the people here complaining are either trolls or have been playing on the awkward controls that is keyboard and mouse.I ordered this game on Origin this morning and thought I'd give it a try since they offer a nice refund policy. After 27GB ofI haven't yet finished this game but I have a feeling a lot of the people giving reviews here haven't either. With that said I believe a lot of the people here complaining are either trolls or have been playing on the awkward controls that is keyboard and mouse.I ordered this game on Origin this morning and thought I'd give it a try since they offer a nice refund policy. After 27GB of download later I found myself quite disappointed with the results. My system met the recommended system requirements yet there were still quite a lot of stutters with framerates. I'm not particularly picky about graphics when it comes to these games especially when it offers a huge amount of content so lowering the settings to minimal helped a bit with that problem. However, there's also this problem with the controls on the keyboard and mouse that I have a major issue with. It made the game feel really cheaply made like a typical MMO with clunky WASD controls. Movement feels weightless and the controls for camera, aiming, and skills just don't seem solid enough.  Also the tactical view is so disconnected from the game that it's like the game is constantly pushing you to play the third person mode instead. The camera work on tactical mode is just as bad sadly. I was hoping to get the sort of controls that was in dragon age where everything felt familiar and you have really solid control over the camera angles over fights.I suppose majority of the work went into the gamepad because after 30 mins I could not bare to play with the keyboard and mouse. I immediately plugged in my ds4 controller and my goodness, the controls were smooth and felt real really great. It was so good on the controller that it was like playing a whole different game. So right after that I decided to get a refund on origin and grabbed myself a ps4 copy and after a couple hours on the game, I must say, everything I read in the reviews are just spot on. This game could end up as one of my favourite games of all time and has a really good spot right beside skyrim.Moral of the story, do not play with keyboard and mouse, it's a nightmare!\"
2014,Dragon Age,"Lol at the people who are giving this a 0, I literally saw one guy write ""I'm giving this a zero to balance it out"" it's like, do you have a life at all bro? Hahaha, anyway, this game is amazing, totally makes up for da2, Roy elements we've been waiting for since dao. graphics are awesome and dragon fights are solid."
2014,Dragon Age,"Awesome game, great story and that graphics! First real ""next-gen"" game. 80-120 hours here I come! Great controls, however the control of the AI team members could be better. Therefore I give it a 9/10"
2014,Dragon Age,This is one of the best games ive ever played simply class for starters the plot is fantastic the graphics really gets u into the game .The characters are unique
2014,Dragon Age,"First off, you'll need to be able to connect to the EA servers to activate this game to play it.Now, if you were hoping for the sequel to Dragon Age : Origins, give it up.

In fact, they handled the situation so poorly with The Warden's absence (sorry, yes everything I hold dear is dying, but  I'm not interested, here's a worthless belt you can sell for 18 gold) and Morrigan's presence during this huge threat, that it'll disappoint you (if you chose the Dark Ritual in Origins you're really going to be angry). Overall, I played the game for 121 hours and I found the whole Inquisition plot not very interesting. The power and respect you're given is forced too quickly without seeming to earn it. Rulers of Orlais and Ferleden don't care if your raising an army and fighting by yourself in their territories, and concede to your will automatically. You tend to stand around more in the game listening to people talk about adventures than actually having one. Unless you count fetch quests as adventures. The plot itself isn't very big, but it meanders around causing the game to drag on for hours and you to lose focus on what is important. It's not like Origins' more intense, focus plot. Dealing with the Mage and Templars. isn't anymore fun than it was in the last game. The use of the word ""Inquisition"" doesn't make much sense considering your job is to do people favors, find things and build an army like a ruler; not torturing people to admit to and rooting out heresy. I wonder if someone was just so in love with the title that the developers were forced to keep it regardless of the storyline or gameplay. But mostly, the problem with this game is its over numerous side quests that are straight from the MMO format of checklists; find twenty of this, find forty of that, kill these, kill those. It is a lot like that game Kingdoms of Amalur: 1001 Dull Quests. I'm also disappointed that all your decisions from the previous game, when you load them up on the EA web site, really don't matter but for conversational pieces, codexes and lackluster cameos. As part of a series, it's disappointing. What started out so great with the first game and had so much potential going forward, just falls flat because there's no payoff in progression with your decisions or characters like in the Mass Effect Series. It is another stand alone version as DA2 was. You could say that this game undoes everything that happened in Origins. Which makes replaying through the series useless.There are some issues with this this games overall performance. Glitches in the ""save game"" can corrupt and freeze you out of playing any further. I recommend alternating between two save files.It certainly isn't the prettiest game that has graced my PS4. Much better graphic wise than the first two, but far shy from where graphics are today. It must have been a rush job trying to port this game from last gen to next gen because the frame rates in the cutscenes and during conflict drop. Overall, the graphics just aren't that good as some things look great, like a rolling sea in the background or dragons that'll chomp you to bits, and yet others look bland and void of texturing. You see people losing their feet through floors and ground, people walking through each other, weapons disappearing in people (and not in a good way), and disappearing/reappearing objects or people as you walk around certain areas. I guess I found the whole animation just plain ugly. Nice facial features and more detail to characters wardrobe and weapons, but overall ugly looking npcs and the bodies that look like marinates. My dwarf just looks like a walking barrel. I hope when they retool Dragon Age 4 that they decide to put their effort into art animation like they did in their other series Mass Effect. The sound is most excellent, as you can hear many noises and conversations occurring a the same time.As for Gameplay, combat is like DA2 not Origins, except you'll squeeze the trigger instead of pushing a button. There is no auto-attack where it needs one. And they're missing the Origins cool finishing moves, AGAIN. They added the ""tactical view"" but that doesn't work very well because it is way too sluggish to operate. Why didn't they take advantage of the touch pad for the PS4? What I really dislike about the combat is that enemies will respawn in certain areas like the game is an MMO. I also believe that they wasted their effort on making mounts to ride, for it is just as quick, if not simpler, to walk through the game. Leveling up has sadly changed as you can no longer put points into your attributes like strength and wisdom, but only in which type of attack you can have on your hot buttons. And it certainly has the most complicated, with the most numerous steps in craft making that I have ever played.Overall, huge effort in making this game, but lack of direction and poor choices makes a lackluster game and ruins the series.Multiplayer? Ppphhhttt\"
2014,Dragon Age,"Boring. That's the word I was looking for. Boring. I have no idea what happened to the creative minds at Bioware, but based on this game I would say they all got canned.Dragon Age series is one of those that has it's fanboys among the gaming community as well as the professional reviewers. However, only one of the groups is getting paid for their praise. As for me, I got this gameBoring. That's the word I was looking for. Boring.

However, only one of the groups is getting paid for their praise. As for me, I got this game (finally) from PSN sales as I really didn't like Dragon Age 2 enough to invest in the next incarnation. First one was brilliant, though, I have to admit that much.So what is wrong with DA:I? A lot. Being a solo RPG, the story is remarkably uninspired, which leads the player to repeatedly ask themselves ""Why am I doing this?"".Secondly, the quests, and game world for that matter, are designed to emulate and MMORPG, namely vanilla WoW. That is, Step1: Get quest, Step2: Collect materials, Step3: ???, Step4: (Don't) Profit. This leads the player to repeatedly ask themselves ""Why am I doing this?"".Thirdly, the battle system is, for the lack of a better adjective, broken. You can basically cruise through the whole game by pressing R2. What makes it further infuriating is that the tactical view is just absolutely useless. If you loved the battle in the first Dragon Age, don't get your hopes up. The battle system in DA:I leads the player to repeatedly ask themselves ""Why am I doing this?"".Fourthly, have the times in RPG gaming really changed so much that character development is equal to ordering large fries with a happy meal? You cannot distribute any attribute points, and the only thing that ""improves"" the characters are better weapons and armor, as skill points are only spent on new combat abilities. As seen above, you only need one button in any battle,  which leads the player to repeatedly ask themselves ""Why am I doing this?"".Final verdict: This game is a sandbox for killing time. It's an MMO that tries to be an RPG or vice versa, while failing to be either.Can we just pull the plug on Bioware already and let Player 2 take a shot at using the jaws of life on the dead RPG scene in next-gen gaming?\"

2014,Dragon Age,"Zzzzzz. That's my review.I really thought, based on the way people talk about Dragon Age, that this game would be a lot deeper. It feels like Diablo but with a different visual viewpoint and with a party rather than solo. There's lots of dialogue but none of the quests or drama feels like it means anything at all. And the combat is not about much more than clicking X. In fact, justZzzzzz. That's my review.I really thought, based on the way people talk about Dragon Age, that this game would be a lot deeper. It feels like Diablo but with a different visual viewpoint and with a party rather than solo. There's lots of dialogue but none of the quests or drama feels like it means anything at all. And the combat is not about much more than clicking X. In fact, just about every action is not about anything other than clicking X. YES I KNOW you CAN press other buttons, to execute alternate attacks based on skills you gain as you play, but you don't have to in order to win. That's the problem. All those extra attacks and spells are no more useful than a new pretty outfit in an MMO. They are unnecessary. No strategy required. Hold down X during a battle and run all around the battle zone. You might die a couple of times, but it won't take very long to win. In Skyrim I felt more like I was the character and that I was a part of the events happening around me. Discovery felt like discovery. Dragon Age; Inquisition feels extremely artificial. I can't even swim. Try to swim in the ocean and you hear a screaming sound (it's supposed to be your character; why would she scream in the water?) and then the game resets with you just next to the shore again. There are slopes that are not very challenging but for some reason you can't climb them. Small walls you inexplicably cannot climb over, even though any 7 year old in the real world could. So, basically, beautiful visuals, but the environments don't feel open world-ish. Instead I feel somewhat channeled artificially. There are tons of barrels and other things that you cannot open. They are just decoration. You can only open select ones. You cannot loot everyone you vanquish. Nonsensically their weapons and armor are not available to loot unless the game decides to give you something, and what it gives you is not really related to the animal or bandit you killed.Ultimately, the game is fun in a mindless sort of way, kind of like a very elaborate Tetris. For a much more involving RPG try Skryim, Oblivion, Morrowind, Daggerfall, and Arena. The combat in Arena and Daggerfall is more interesting because as you wave your mouse around, your character waves his/her weapon, so you feel connected to the combat - no just hitting a single key. Arena is very old and has crappy graphics by today's standards, but it is gripping. I think it's free now and legally; just google it.\"
2014,Dragon Age,"This is my second review of the game. I previously gave it a 6. After making it to the final mission I am downgrading my score to 1. In a nutshell, if you are someone who enjoyed DAO, if yo have played classics like BG2 and KOTOR and you are expecting something that preserves the spirit of these games while bringing them into the current generation then you simply need to avoid this gameThis is my second review of the game. I previously gave it a 6. After making it to the final mission I am downgrading my score to 1. In a nutshell, if you are someone who enjoyed DAO, if yo have played classics like BG2 and KOTOR and you are expecting something that preserves the spirit of these games while bringing them into the current generation then you simply need to avoid this game because it is an utter sacrilege of the RPG genre. No, there was no innovation here, no improvement, just poor judgment, bad execution and a misguided tampering and wholesale destruction of what makes a good RPG. I will be damned before I ever buy another EA/Bioware title. These people are in the game destruction business, not the game making business. DAI doesn't feel anything like DAO. The whole atmosphere and vibe of that game is gone. Just the hollow names of things, people and places have survived but they bare no resemblance with the originals.After about 75 hours of gameplay and killing 2 dragons with my eyes closed and finger on R2 while occasionally using the blizzard spell (i kid you not, this is the FULL extent of the combat in this game, and I was playing on hard) I found myself not having the motivation to complete the final mission or see the ending since I simply couldn't care less about the stereotypical paper-thin bland story. The story telling, dialogue and overall writing in this game is absolutely horrendous. The story is just ""there's a bad guy who wants to take over the world by harnessing the power of evil. Gather a team and stop him"". That's it. It's pretty much Mass Effect 3 with dragons and armor. In ME3 you also have to recruit a team to go fight the bad guys. The result of this now familiar EA/Bioware approach is that they can entirely skip writing an actually decent story and instead tie a bunch on separate, disconnected bland mini missions and maps into a game. the result is something that doesn't grab you, doesn't draw you in and doesn't make you care about anything happening in the static game world. There are barely any towns in AOI. All characters including your own team members might as well be cardboard cutouts on wheels. The NPC in towns and camps just stand there, not reacting to anything and simply start muttering random BS when you walk next to them to give you the impression that they are actually alive and not sacks of potatoes with faces drawn on them. The accents in the game are all contrived and terrible. Who's idea was it to bring caricatured french, italian and spanish accents to a fantasy world in an alternate universe. The voice actors in this game are so busy feigning their butchered french and latin accents that they forget to actually include humour, wit and feeling into their lines. Probably the same douche who's idea it was to use French and Italian names to name things and places. It shows the total lack of creativity when you have to rip off european landmarks like Venice and Versailles to create your fantasy world. Then when the characters in those setting speak with ridiculous bad french accents it just completely destroys immersion. No words can describe how bad this is.The game seems promising in the first few hours, but after a while you realize how boring and repetitive it is and you lose all interest in playing. I kept hoping for more to come but I finally made it to the final mission and I realized there was nothing to come. I had already seen it all. Finally I will just mention that this game is 95% MMO style filler content of collecting crap, and being an errand boy for badly voice 2 dimensional static game world inhabitants who want you to be their messenger boy.So to sum up: boring story, lame dialogue, overall bad writing, no immersion, no tension, no suspense, boring non-vscieral combat, no strategy, dumbed down levelling up, bad ugly facial animations, lazy cutscenes. This game is basically a scam. A terrible product aimed at appealing to the lowest common denominator. Something that in trying to please everyone, alienates the fans of the genre, pleases those who don't know better and makes money for EA/Bioware. The big losers are those who wanted a quality game to truly enjoy.As soon as I finish writing this review I am heading out to go sell my copy of DAI. I don't want this piece of trash game taking up space in my drawer.The final thing I will mention is that this game does't deserve any of the praise it got. Most reviews have obviously been bought by EA or these sites have moron reviewers who can't tell the difference between a good game and a bad game. Only a handful of sites gave the game the score it deserves. One of them is the german site ""4Players.de"" which I have started using through google translate. the translation isn't prefect, but I feel I can trust them. Other sites that seem trustworthy are edge-online, incgamers, gamecritics and gaming age. The rest are simply tools and a waste of time.\"
2014,Dragon Age,"Boring time waster.  That is all this game is to me.  Good graphics.  No story to keep me going.  Boring button mashing MMO style combat.  Can't seem to turn it on to play these days.  Very mediocre.  All it needed was an interesting story with a little mystery.  Quests are kill monsters, close gates, collect resources, rescue people.  Very boring!  It's not terrible.  Just not very fun.Boring time waster.  That is all this game is to me.  Good graphics.  No story to keep me going.  Boring button mashing MMO style combat.

Very boring!  It's not terrible.  Just not very fun.  That said, I lose interest in most open world games and MMOs because of the quest quality and tedium.  I like a little more progress made when I play for 2 hours and I don't need another job (have one job, don't want another).  I need some adventure and a reason to continue button mashing and leveling.  Same reason I didn't like Destiny.  Big does not equal better in games to me.  Lets hope the Witcher 3 keeps its interesting quest/story design that it succeeded with in the last entry and doesn't fall prey to these same problems.\"
2014,Dragon Age,"I'll make this short and simple, Game of the year contender. Dragon age inquisition is one of the best rpg's I've played in a long time. Fun world, good characters and so many things to do.  Between all the crafting and quests, it's easy to see 100's of hours spent playing this great game. Great job Bioware , thanks for making another great game."
2014,Dragon Age,"I was fully expecting this game to be terrible. I am pleasantly surprised by pretty much every aspect of the game. I am by no means close to finishing the game, but it is absolutely massive. I feel one of the most important things to an RPG is exploration and this game has it in spades. This will be in my top 5 games this year no doubt. I can't wait to play this through the rest of the winter."

AMD cards and DX11 in this game don't like each other as much.* The best music I have ever heard in a game, and I'm only 10 hours in.. it's just...... spectacular.* The Storytelling, so far, is amazing... only bested by the superb atmosphere and character interactions.* GOTY shoe in from what I've played.. it's the Dragon Age game you have been waiting for since finishing Origins, believe the hype.\"
2014,Dragon Age,"I agree with Ace99.  This game is very disappointing and is not Dragon Age.  It's more like a LOTR, Skyrim and Diablo 3 mutation.

The story is boring, the quests are redundant, the companions have no personality except for maybe Dorian, Sera and Iron bull but you really don't care about any of them like you did in DA:O.  I'm playing on a PS3 and the graphics are horrible.  The characters all look too shiny.  Controls go wonky at times like you hit one button for a spell and the map comes up.  I've had the game crash about 3 times.  There's something wrong with the sound as well, voices are speaking when the NPC is dead, music plays then stops, etc.   I've also just killed a deer and he amazingly rose from the dead and is standing in a forest all frozen!  The crafting system is tedious and too big, the character creation process is tedious and too big as well plus the hairstyles are horrible - how many bald headed and short-short haircuts do we have to have?? There's about 5 or so.  Tactics system is gone and the new tactics camera is ridiculous.  I do not want to have to micromanage every fight I have.  There are no dwarves to speak of, no children, no funny townspeople, and even my hero is boring.  I'm playing a mage and the way the camera angle is I can't even see what my companions are doing because I'm so far away.  I can't even tell if my spells are hitting.  If I get closer the enemies all come after me.  The AI is inconsistent - I'll wipe out one group with ease then get killed with one-hit by an archer in the next!  Very frustrating.  The spells are weak, there are no healing spells, and potions can only be gotten in camps.  You also have to run all over the place to find your companions in a town - not like Origins where they were all in your camp.  This game is a perfect example of bigger is not always better.\"
2014,Dragon Age,"Dragon Age Inquisition takes the greatest aspects of a classic Bioware RPG and combines them with stunning visuals and an exploration system that is one of the best to date. Take all this and add a deep, emotional Bioware style story, and you have one of the best RPG's to date."

(dunno what difficulty lvl he was playing at)- party member deaths are not a problem at all as long as at least one party member survives, they just play dead, you know, after all this is an RPG *larpedylarp*- strategic map nearly without meaningful decisions, just another huge grind- the wilderness/rural areas are full of MMO fetch quests and retarded treasure hunts (press button to follow marker or sth like that), side quests in general are subpar (he didn't mention the stronghold and companion quests, maybe they are an exception?)- lore is presented in a very unimmersive way through sterile codex menus (I remember that being a problem in DA:O too)- game doesn't reward exploration because you just have to get near something interesting to get codex entries and quest triggers fired, after a while you just ignore the noise- side content dialogues are often badly written (sometimes too silly or just uninteresting)- the removal of a healing skill tree for mages really kills combat tactics, kind of moot since the game is incredibly easy even on the hardest of difficulty settings- Underpinnings of new world engine still have signs of classic Bioware flaws ... you can jump up mountains in the Hinterlands, but in town .. you have to FAST TRAVEL IN THE SAME ZONE TO GO UP A FLIGHT OF STAIRS\"

If i listed all my complaints I would need more than 5000 words and no one wants to read all that, so here are the main reasons why you should wait to play this game, if you ever decide to play1) Looting is a struggle because you have to stand right over bodies to loot and you have to use right click for the use key... which is difficult and frustrating key for that2) The graphics are seriously lacking for a game of its time... maybe if this was 2005 I wouldnt notice the glaring amounts of sheen on characters hair and the lack of finese.3) The combat... similar to the story line... is on a track. You just spam skills and left click (left click to attack is also really obnoxious) and you'll win. I was on normal so if you really want it to be hard you can kite around on harder settings and enjoy the auto-lock combat style.4) This IS NOT A FREE ROAM GAME... Contrary to what was advertised this game is very much so on a track and you play through it quest by quest... exploring has no real purpose and there's nothing pretty to go see because the graphics kind of blow.5) Your character responds when you don't want him to and will say too much or not enough, you aren't even in control for the dialog at all times,6) I was going to stop at five but this really is an obnoxious quality that I cant leave out: the music is terrible. I have only heard one combat song so far and it plays outside of combat too! The undertone is too loud and it drowns out the rest of the sounds. There is no stable equalization! Its so frustrating to listen to this game.Bonus: you are always running... shift is too hard to program as a run feature now and they already gave you jump so what more do you need.Okay so here's the only reason I played it as long as I did: no invisible walls. That right there is amazing. If my character could feasibly do something with jump i was able to get there. Which was awesome! I feel like if they put that much thought into the rest of the games design we would be experiencing next gen. **** here fellas.\"

Before that it had been Knights of the Old Republic 2 that left me yearning for years. Don't get me wrong, there are a ton of high quality RPG's out there. The Mass Effect Series and Deus Ex Human Revolution were outstanding, but neither had the same party style gameplay that the fantasy counterparts in the RPG world have and the Elder Scroll series is just a different style of RPG. Dragon Age Inquisition skipped over the hack and slash style of Dragon Age 2 to return to a level, not quite as high as Dragon Age Origins at its time, that is enthralling with good longevity.The game follows a mighty hero that falls haphazardly into the middle of an apocalyptic event. It's the fairly standard fare of ""I'm a nobody, who happens to be amazing, and falls backward into being a hero.""

There are quite a few religious overtones to the game that can go either way depending on how you want to interact with the world. Being someone who is, myself, religious I found quite a few thoughtful encounters, but they could easily be played the exact opposite for someone who is not, or fairly agnosticly.The world is beautiful and varied. The ten main areas are fairly diverse, though there are three areas that are essentially slight variations on desert. The game is a bit deceiving as the first area, the Hinterlands, is by far the largest and most densely packed area and the other areas are either much smaller or slightly smaller and much less densely populated. Groups in the different areas are mostly interesting and the cultures are widely varied.Combat is fun, though there are no healing spells in the game, which is my main complaint. With limited potions available for healing it felt like they were trying to mimic the healing effects in Dark Souls (Dark Souls does having healing spells, but their effectiveness while in combat isn't very good). The problem with this in Dragon Age is that Dark Souls is rarely about fighting hordes of enemies and only have to worry about keeping yourself alive instead of managing multiple characters. Dragon fights are epic and provide a good challenge and a great sense of reward once they are defeated. I will sayI played through the game on nightmare (for the trophy) which was tough and intense, before switching to normal after I beat the game. Playing on nightmare was enjoyable, but once I was on normal the combat became dull as it required little effort. Even for enemies about the same level as my character I rarely had to do much more than just hold down the attack button.The party members feel alive with their own motivations and takes on the world. There was only one party member I flatly disliked having in my party because of their personality. It wasn't the best cast of characters I've ever had in an RPG, but the main party members along with the other recurring characters made the game more enjoyable and made me feel invested in what happens.A lot of what Dragon Age Inquisition does best is having a lot of content on the side. There is a war room where you can send agents out into the world to complete quests on their own and gain rewards and power for you. You can sit in judgment of those who have opposed you. There is a keep to upgrade called Skyhold which you eventually make your way to after the first part of the game being spent at Haven. There is a detailed crafting system, and a gathering system, that allows you to create armor, weapons, upgrade spells and craft extra components to go on weapons as well as runes to enchant them. The armor and weapons I was able to craft were never as good as what I was able to find in the world, and by the end of the game I was bogged down with good epic gear (and an inordinate amount of epic two handed melee weapons). The runes are powerful and useful, though be careful as they are consumed on use and can't be reused, and useful runes are rare and the materials to craft them aren't very common either.Dragon Age Inquisition is a great game that does a lot of extra things not seen normally in RPG's. Despite my few gripes (lack of healing spells, crafting recipes that aren't actually helpful) there is a ton of content to the game that stays interesting. I've logged eighty hours in the game and still enjoy it. There is a multiplayer component similar to Mass Effect 3's, but I doubt anybody would be buying the game for that. It's fine, but the main draw is the extensive and enjoyable single player. I would highly recommend this as a buy.\"

It helps enormously if you've played DAO and DA2 cause the game does not try to introduce the world in any decent way to new players. The entire beginning of the game is bad: beside a 1 second explosion in the menu (yes, the MENU!) there is no good build-up to the genesis of the Inquisition. It feels like in the time one would go to the toilet the entire inquisition is all of a sudden an organisation known to all, even though it didn't even exist in the introductionary phase. It took me 17 hours (according to the time shown in save game) to get any real feeling into the DA:I world, opposed to the instant immersion DAO offered. I'm still in my time for a refund and that is what I will do. It's not a bad game but wait untill the price drops below 30 euros.\"

The companions (and advisors) are my favourite team across all Bioware games, they are funny, interesting, have heart wrenching plots and whether you befriend them or have... antagonistic relationships with them... the relationships and character growth feels real and personal.Plot wise the game is solid, and for the first time in the Dragon Age series I feel as though I don't want to move onto a new protagonist next game. The Inquisition is far reaching across Thedas, and I feel committed to my Inquisitor and my companions to follow them through to whatever comes next.I used to say ""No one plays Dragon Age for the combat""... and I was right. Until now. Combining tactical and real time combat on PS4 is a triumph, and the game is perfect to 'play it your way'. I've played through all in real time, on casual/normal settings, and I've played through on Nightmare twice, once with lots of tactical camera, and once without, but with paying lots of attention to finding and crafting gear, and creating the best builds for everyone. All these play styles have felt fun and fulfilling, and despite being a 80- 150 hour game each time, has never become boring!Similarly there is lots of side content, which is there if you want it, either for lore and story and character purposes, or simply for experience, but you're never forced to endlessly grind minor fetch quests. The thing about this game, is that it is wonderfully designed and balanced for you to play it the way you want. If something isn't fun for you, don't bother with it anymore- turn down the combat (or turn it up!), stop questing in the hinterlands (or do more!), whatever you want!The multiplayer part of the game, while not quite as fun and fast paced as ME3MP, was still surprisingly fun, especially with friends, and well supported. I play it frequently, at weekends to do the challenges, and when I don't have much time but my fingers are itching for some dragon age!Also you can smooch and cuddle with some real cuties, or get down to sexy business with them, in the best romance content bioware has ever produced. And we all know Bioware games are just overly complicated dating sims :P\"

And the landscapes are beautiful.The Teams you get and pick are great too, not as interesting as previous Dragon age, but they hold their own.Lots of skillsThis game has some major good points, but also a few nasty bits:-GoodThe size of the game is amazing, with so much choice about where to go and what missions to work on, that you can get a little lost, which is not a bad thing. And the landscapes are beautiful.The Teams you get and pick are great too, not as interesting as previous Dragon age, but they hold their own.Lots of skills to play with.Combat can be as easy or hard as you want. If you play a really tactical game, and take the right skills, you can down a boss in a matter of seconds. or you can let the AI take over and fight it out in an old fashioned kind of way. It's your call.Loads of story and lore if you are a fan of that kind of thingBadIf you like good stories then you really need ti understand about previous DA games. I've played them all, but even I had trouble remembering some of the details. However, in order to understand the stories, you need to know about things like Grey Wardens etc as this game does not explain them to a newcomer.Customization - Physical -I'm no artist, and no matter how long I spent in the character creation screen, I never managed to get a good looking character, and even the in game created characters aren't much better. Not a major issue, but with the amount of cut scenes in game, it would be nice to know my char didn't look like they were in the middle of a sex change operation, or had been in a horrific car accident. Romance is quite a big thing in this, and the only one I even came close to fancying was Leilana, and you can't romance her. Again a minor issue, but as romance is always part of DA, it would be nice to have pretty people doing it. Remember Morrigan :)No customization of stats. I can choose the abilities I have but STR, DEX, etc are all decided by the game.Landscapes - My biggest issue with this game! BW have made the game so rich in environments that you need a ping to highlight where loot/interactables are. This is a v good thing. For most missions, you are also told where to go so you don't need to be aimlessly wondering around, but the issue is even though I know where I need to go, BW have made getting to said places so unnecessarily difficult that it drives me mad. Ledges that look like you should be able to get up them but can't, long convoluted routes to something that is only a few feet away, in some case you have to go round a ridge and just keep jumping up until you finally find the ledge that looks no different from any other but BW have decided you can climb this one. It's incredibly tedious.This is a huge game with loads to do, so we don't need annoying time sinks like this, just let the size of the game speak for itself!\"

2014,Dragon Age,"Bioware rightfully made the best fantasy game only beat by Skyrim. The real draw of this game is Character customization, choices, and discovery. I always love creating a female character and this game doesn't disappoint in that respect unlike Fallout 4 for example. Inquisition still has the best dialogue system and the most decisions out of modern games. So the only competition in that respect is between well, previous Bioware titles and Telltale Games. However, most choices don't have a big enough impact. No matter who you choose, Templars or Mages, you'll still have to defend Haven from the forgettable villain. I  understand that part is critical to the story but Bioware has given much more weight to choices in the Mass Effect series. But Skyhold really is a big improvement over the Normandy. The world is plenty big and the highlights visually are the houses in the Emerald Graves, the Eleven temple in the end, and the sand dunes of the Western Approach(beat Elder Scrolls to the punch). Due to the leveling and weapon damage system, enemies had to have large health bars to make the former mechanics work. There is no point in getting a better weapon if the Red Templars succumb to one or two hits. This makes encounters long and less fun. Dragons take so long to kill.Only at the end does the story get intriguing. This is mostly thanks to Morigan(who I kept thinking was the villain due to the reveal trailer) and the Elvin lore.Since that I was eager to make progress in the game, I skipped most of the cutscenes, dialogue, and books;something I usually don't do.It ended up cutting my playthrough in half(about 50 hours instead of the average 100+)In a world where Gods and magic exist, religion stills gets thing wrong. Something I only realized towards the end. Not that they were morally wrong(the chantry is clearly the old christian church and a lot of it draws inspiration from the real world) but that it's not certain who these gods were as Mythal turns out not to be an Elvin god but Morigan's Immortal human mother. And there isn't proof of the maker or the Old Gods existence. The only interesting part of Coryriphius (spelled wrong) was when he mentions that the thrones in the heavens were empty. That mystery definitely will be explained in future games.The end seems to point towards a Grey Warden civil war being a plot point for DAV. It really sucks that EA most likely took the real ending and released it as the Trespasser DLC only for current-gen. That will probably stop me from playing it as I played it on the 360 and will likely get a PS4.So the near future for Bioware is Andromeda. Something that is taking far too long to make. Is it going through development hell? Almost. Bioware is trying to make a far more ambitious game than Mass Effect 3. But here's the problem. This is in terms of content, not substance. Clearly the scale of this game is whats being built upon. And in my opinion thats a bad thing. Inquisition would have been significantly better in terms of story, pacing, and level design if Bioware didn't try to compete with the sheer size of Skyrim. Either way, I'm almost certain that Andromeda will be a great game:)\"

The open world is a change, a small one though since it's what every other game is basically trying to do or has done. Though, for DAI I find it really didn't do anything for the story as a whole.

Sorry for me it just doesn't stick. The companions even, except for a few are just remade older characters. I only found a few that actually stood out. It feels more like an MMO rather than an RPG. Sure you get very nice weapon customization, however the class customization is not as good at all. Hell they even took out most of the good classes that most fans enjoyed in the prior games. There is no more blood mage, for example. They condenced and tried to mix the trees into new warpped crappier versions.

I can't put enough plusses on that one. The cutscenes are just great, until now I wasn't even aware that computer games could express such a variety of expressions and emotions. Also the way the cameras are set during the cutscenes - like watching a movie, not at all like the static-expression-and-emotionless-statues you meet in Skyrim. The characters in DAI have a depth I have never encountered before. They are authentic, they have a personality and the game really makes you care about them, wanting to know more of their past, of their opinions and such. I have finished several playthroughs and each time there were new things to discover, new angles and perspectives from which the story could be seen. A character I loathed on my first playthrough really grew on me the second time as I overcame my opinion of her and actually started to learn more about her. This is just a great story, that draws you in, that captivates you and that actually has a lot of references to our modern day society. The game confronts you with religion in numerous ways, and no matter what your opinion is on that, the characters you meet will make you start to think. The parallels to the catholic church are there, and they are displayed in a well differentiated fashion. I am not a religious person, yet some talks with Mother Giselle, Cassandra or Leliana really made me question my so far rather negative view of the church. And this is just an example of how this story creates parallels to real issues without judging, but showing many perspectives on the topic and leaving it up to the player to make up his opinion. There simply is a depth and subtext to this game that goes beyond what one might expect from a video game. That's why I like this game so much. Not sooo much for the gameplay, but for the way it is an interactive story telling medium between a good novel and a good movie.++ The setting: I just love the way you build up your inquisition and get the feel of ruling a powerful organization+++ have ot mention them again: your party members - just a bunch of great non-cliche party members. From the eloquent front warrior to the witty and overconfident and gay wizard to the mysterious elf - they are all well written characters.As I said  - this is my personal view, others value a well balanced gameplay above a good story and will therefore give a different score. Speaking of the gameplay, lets get to some negative points:- the gameplay: Dragon Age Origins (not Inquisition) started out as a somewhat modern adaption of the famous baldurs gate that was known for its tactical depth. Dragon Age Inquisition has left that noble path behind and leaves me missing the tactical depth as it has more of an mediocre action oriented gameplay.- the inventory: is a mess."" I wanna switch my armor. now I have to run to the smith, dismantle the shoes and gauntlets from my armor and put them to the new one, so I can wear it."" - In other game switching equipment is just the matter of pressing a button in DAI you have fiddle through a hundred menus to get it done. Dealing with my inventory is no fun at all.- Elves look like starved, sick people you usually only see on their deathbeds, only bones and skin. I know this a harsh critic , but whenever I tried to start out as an elf and saw my inquisitor wearing robes or the (horrible) stronghold pyjama I got that image of a starved out sick person in my mind and couldn't play any more. Maybe its just me, and I know elves have to be somewhat slim, but I couldn't stand to look at an elven male inquisitor... sorry.- the big areas - yes they are seen as a big asset to the game, but really they aren't necessary for that great story they are telling, they are rather hindering. This would have been a great game, even with smaller areas.- side quests are pathetic - while the main story and the character quests are great, the side quests are useless. ""I am the mighty inquisitor, but unless I go out and collect 150 daisy flowers, three pickles and two dozen pebbles the inquisition will fall to ruin because among my entire army there is no one who could do that except me...."" less, but more meaningfull sidequests would have been the wiser choice.- the assortment of enemies is very small. There could have been more types of demons and stuffI know I stated a lot of negative points, but none of those can dampen my enthusiasm when I think of the great story this game can tell. No game is perfect, neither is this one, but for someone who loves a well written and well displayed story this is the game you wanna get\"

2014,Dragon Age,"Vast world, great combat mechanics, and great character. Main mission is a bit short but the side missions are abundant and fun. However, this game doesn't intrigue me as much as Skyrim or Witcher. The reason lies in the kind of boring combat system and not-so-fun world roaming."

First, there are a lot of options available for character design. You can choose between the different classes of characters and then adjust their face and hair, etc to exactly how you'd like it. Second, this game is about choice and you get to make a lot of choices. Role playing as The Inquisitor you can decide how many of the side quests to do, which NPCs you want to go deeper into their stories, etc. You don't have to do every side quest. You don't have to get to know every NPC, including the major ones. You get to pick. After 4 playing through 4 times I knew which NPCs I enjoyed and which ones I didn't care to follow. Not only that but in cases like Liliana, you get to help her find herself again(if you pick the right choices).So this game is for people who like to immerse themselves in a different world, for people who enjoy reading codex and getting to know NPCs. I cannot say enough good things about this game. It has high replay value. The combat is fun but also easy on Normal so if you want a challenge I'd start with a higher difficulty.If you enjoy role-playing and immersing yourself in a fantasy world you will love this game.\"

I beat the game at the 72 hour mark after doing a healthy mix of storyline quests and side missions. It is my first Dragon Age game.After reading official reviews on this game, and seeing multiple articles mentioning it as a GOTY contender I decided it was definitely worth playing. I hadn't played a fantasy RPG of this scale before, the closest to it was probably Oblivion years ago on the PC, so it seemed like it would be a fresh experience that I would enjoy investing a lot of time in to.The short of it: I enjoyed playing DA:I, but found many elements of the game weighing down on the overall experience. Bioware made a huge game, which they may have tried to throw everything and the kitchen sink in to; much of the game comes across as uninspiring, repetitive, and clunky after the time it takes to complete an average play through. After the 40 hour mark, I began feeling like the game had lasted long enough and that I just wanted it to end. There was still so much I could do, but it just didn't seem like it was really worth it.I'm left thinking, had Bioware cut down on a lot of the filler then they may have had more time to commit towards building a more engaging/fun experience (with less bugs!)7/10 - unlikely to revisit this franchise.\"

At time of typing, I have completed every trophy in the game (sans the Nightmare mode [and, by proxy, the Platinum] one; the Persuasive one is bugged although I have 15 agents) and have collected every mosaic, bottle, landmark, blah blah blah. I was at 104 hours when I finished so I really don't get why people are saying they have 150+ hours and still aren't done.I digress. I have several legitimate concerns about the way DA: I padded out content. I see a lot of people saying ""if you don't like it, don't do it!"" but the problem with that argument is the fact that the fluff-to-content ratio is extremely lopsided. When I completed the game, I still had 273 Power left and nothing to use it on. That right there tells you there is an EXCESSIVE amount of fluff that does little towards the progression of the game's story itself. Likewise, since the game opens up many of the areas early on - right after Skyhold, really - it's possible to go through and hit a wall with character progression within the first 30-ish hours of the game. By the time I went to the third major story mission (Halamshiral), I was wearing the very gear I would be wearing for the remaining 50+ hours of gameplay. This progression ceiling does not only apply to the story progression but also to the fluff as well. When I finished collecting all the shards and opened the final door in the Oasis, I was rewarded with gear that was markedly inferior to the stuff I had crafted or found 10+ hours prior. This doesn't even touch on how poor the context is behind most of these side missions. Most of it boils down to: Go do this because Inquisition.The War Table is a great example of poor design and fluff in action. Multiple 5+ hour missions that grant minimal reward. Even some 12+ hour missions! Here's a practical example: I sent Josephine off on a 15 hour mission of negotiations in northwestern Ferelden. The next day when it was complete, I got a four line paragraph explaining what happened, a whopping 106 gold and an Amulet of Power. Woooooooo. Likewise, the War Table is a poor substitute for materials gathering. If I send Cullen out to gather minerals, it takes him 15-ish minutes (give or take, depending on agents) to come back with 6-8 minerals. When I gather minerals from a node, I gather anywhere from 1-4 per click and there are almost always 2-3 nodes in close proximity. In the same 15 minutes, I can easily gather three times as much. Plus, you cannot send all three of your people to gather from the same resource or region, thus making gathering via your War Council an even bigger slog than doing it yourself.I found a lot of the character development quest lines and conversation trees banal and paper-thin, not anywhere close to the same level of character development found in other Bioware titles. The Cassandra/Varric character development seemed to the most well fleshed out while Iron Bull and Sera were the most entertaining to keep in the party for random banter. But, by the end, I felt no real attachment to any except the ones who started the quest with me (notably Cassandra and Varric) and doing the ally quests wasn't all that satisfying. If anything, it felt like an obligatory BioWare staple of throwing a whole bunch of allies at the player just because they could. Assuming the full party is acquired, did the player really need 3 warriors, 3 rogues, and 3 mages, in addition to whatever class the player character is?The main story arc was decent enough, if not slightly generic, and at least it kept me invested. In looking back, I could have finished the game around 30-40 hours and felt satisfied, perhaps even moreso.Beyond the fluff issue, gameplay is often clunky, especially if you play melee classes on harder difficulty level, and the game pushes the player into FAR TOO MANY menu screens for inventory and character management.I don't regret purchasing or playing the game and I gladly give it a 3 out of 5 (6/10) overall but I see little compelling reason to play it again. The characters hold little interest and the outcome will be mostly the same (only very small changes in the ending slide show) regardless of choices made.\"

I thought it was a real sloppy move from Bioware, which had previously done something like the Mass Effect series, without messing with the saving progression of the story. not to mention that by using the name ""Inquisition"", Bioware has raised higher expectations of its game, for the possibilities were many. However the game does not add anything new, it is more of the same. Not much in terms of originality.DA Inquisition is a game that has beautiful graphics, but its gameplay is awful. The AI acts strange, ignoring commands, moving when it is not supposed to and remaining still while being attacked. The 2 other games in the series had active battle which actually worked, which were much better implemented, and while the idea of a tactical camera is very good, in practice it is very awkward, because many times micromanaging is affected by the AI's inability to respond.In terms of story, if the game were a spin-off it would have been masterful, however it feels completely disconnected of the other 2 games, with things being ""reintroduced"" without any connection, as if to say ""Hey, you are continuing a story!"". Tthere are so many side quests, that sometimes it feels as if you're both the life-saver and the errand boy of Thedas. Not much fun in gathering herbs or finding livestock lost in the mountains. The game lacks for its excess. Some quests fell completely unrelated to the story, and they start to get boring very early in the game.Romancing was another big disappointment, considering previous games in the series, in which you could choose from psychologically different characters. the options in DA Inquisition are the least interesting in the whole series, at least for a straight male character. The most interesting characters to romance are unavailable, and that is another frustration. Just to compare, Mass Effect 1 had 2 options (for straight males), ME 2 had 4 and ME 3 had several, though not completely ""romanceable"". They were last generation games, DVD format.In terms of challenge, the game itself is not difficult, but the stupidity with which the AI acts makes it much harder indeed. Even by disabling AI I still couldn't make a character stay still, and that resulted in dozens of deaths.in relation to perks and skills, the game oversimplified the skill/perk tree, and removed the option to have a healer in your party. First RPG I ever played to do that, and I had to use potions throughout my game. Very frustrating, and again I felt cheated.  The combat skills are somehow linked with DA 2 skills, though there is a lack of variation within classes. All characters within a same category feel exactly like the others. A rogue is a rogue, and a fighter is a fighter. No point in choosing, kept the same formation all the time.While the item gathering has been increased, again it feels poorly implemented, and the inventory is so confusing that it took 20 minutes every time I wanted to rearrange/change equipment. Not to mention the similarity with Skyrim, mining for metals and crafting armor, though again without meaning or depth. the option to reset a character's skills seems valid after you reach a certain point in the game, but having that from the beginning only supports the idea of not needing to change party members. Only skills.In a nutshell, everything in the game is massive, but shallow at the same time. It is like a restaurant which sells burgers, pizza, chinese, pasta, steaks and sushi, though none with excellence. Developers should have focused on what had previously worked, improved what needed to improve, and add SOME features, not making this attempt to include everything that was ever used before.\"

More insanity, more camp, more fun; Playing this game will make you feel like you're in an ecstasy induced coma.The controls are spot on, the combos and flow of battle are still magnificent, and witch time is still the coolest thing out there in action games today. The boss fights are even more grandiose than the first game, with crumbling stages, multiple bosses at the same time, fighting while flying through the skies, etc. The scenery and assets are gorgeous (even if the texture quality sometimes leaves something to be desired due to the weak hardware of the Wii U) The best thing though about Bayonetta 2 over the first one is that Platinum removed all of the frustrating instant failure QTEs that were found in the first game. There are still button prompts during the climax scenes and the like, but none of those ""push this button in .5 seconds or you lose"" QTEs. Great choice Platinum!When I first heard that Bayonetta 2 was being revived by Nintendo I was both overjoyed and disappointed at the same time. The reason being I feared Nintendo was going to lower on the ""aesthetic"" of Bayonetta to make the game more ""kid friendly"". That isn't the case at all here, Bayonetta and her crazy antics are all still here to behold. She remains gaming's best heroine and is a true statement on what an empowering female character in a video game should be. She's pretty much the anti ""femi-nazi"" (modern feminist) and harkens back to what a real feministic character is. She's a strong cool badass, comfortable with her sexuality, and has a humanistic side that keeps her from veering too far off into the unrealistic territory (including a strong mothering instinct as seen at various points in the series).I will say though that the only real issue I have with the game (and this is more of a personal reflection) is that during the climax scenes, you don't hear anything like the cover of ""Fly Me to the Moon"" playing. I really enjoyed that in the first game and it's a shame they opted to just play the regular score instead. Perhaps this changes later in the game (I am about halfway through).Overall Bayonetta 2 is an easy choice for game of the year (and possibly of the decade). It's the sequel die hard fans of the series who will buy Wii U systems just to play this game (as I did) deserve. If you don't already own a Wii U but really want to play this game, please go out and support Nintendo for reviving the series and purchase one (as well as supporting Platinum for making such a great series).  Believe the hype, it's real.\"
2014,Bayonetta 2,"I bought this game only due to the lackluster wii U library. But WOW was i surprised, this game is a non stop action thriller that makes you file amazing for everything you do. I've not played god of war and i know there is allot similarity so i will have to check that series out as well. I haven't had this much fun in a video game since warhammer 40k space marine."

2014,Bayonetta 2,"Just an absolutely fantastic game, takes the awesome action and controls of the first and literally perfects them in every way.  The story is much better than the first, though admittedly still semi-shallow and a bit convoluted without any real deep explanation of certain elements, but doesn't detract from the gameplay at all."

It looks way better than Bayonetta 1 thanks to the artstyle and color palette change. I really can't find any cons for singleplayer. It offers a ton of replay value.

It's also nice that you get awarded for not mindless button mashing, even though it looks like just button mashing at first.To the issues about oversexualisation and objectification of women:This game is absolutely over the top with their stereotypisation - they use parodies of clichÃ©s. You get the silly, foulmouthed italian mafioso type, you get the black tough guy   la Samuel L. Jackson Tarantino-Style, the slightly narcissistic beau-good guy Luka, the Italian Womanizer stereotype. And you get the sexy vamp ""I care only about me"" nigh-immortal witch, that finds pleasure in teasing everything and everyone. And she doesn't care about men one bit.The sexualisation of Bayonetta, in that regard, fits right in with the parody cast. Do I sometimes cringe when I see crotch-shot upon crotch shot? Definitely. Do I mind it? No. It is a parody of sexualisation and objectification, and fits right in with the rest of the cast and story. I am for gender equality, and I don't like the girlyfication and objectification of women in the media, and most of all, marketing. This, to me, toys with exactly that and makes a joke out of it.Oh, and, something nobody here or in any review mentioned: did anyone notice that Jeanne is very flat chested? She does not feature huge breasts, and that is actually refreshing in a world that screams ""you have to have this big breasts to be womanly"".\"

However if they ever did make DLC it would be a nice addition as it would expand upon an already great and complete game.If you're looking for a different experience to the first Bayonetta you're out of luck because it's essentially the same gameplay as the first just with slight variations and additions, but really, why fix something when it's not broken? Well maybe the insane difficulty is a little bit more friendlier than the first even on Normal but by no means is it not challenging to your reflexes and memory as a gamer.The story and characters are over the top and simply ridiculous, but that's not a bad thing, it's a fricken awesome thing and the amount of times I laughed... I love the more vibrant colours compared to the first game too, the setting just looks a lot better in my opinion and the colours really bring out the world. And along with the new look for Bayonetta as well as all the new enemies everything looks great. Also if you're a prude you're going to hate Bayonetta's dominating sexual personality, but if you like me and don't care and think that she is just badass, then you will love her!Let's hope this gets Game of the Year and shows all the haters and especially game publishers like EA and especially Ubisoft that Nintendo is still in this fight.

This game expands on the enemy type to now also include her old demonic friends from inferno who have now become disloyal to her.ThisAh Bayonetta 2, what can i say that hasn't been said in every review already.First off it continues the story of Bayonetta, a Umbra Witch who uses her hair (yes i said her hair) as a weapon to fight off angelic foes whenever she comes across them. This game expands on the enemy type to now also include her old demonic friends from inferno who have now become disloyal to her.This game builds on the first game quite well, even if on a less powerful system then we all wished for. The environments range from the golden skies of Paradiso, to the red and black world of Inferno itself, everything looks amazing. You can really tell the amount of detail and time they took to create each individual environment. The angelic enemies look similar to the first game with the porcelain faces and headless bodies but are still a spectral to look at. The new demonic enemies all look completely unique and fresh. The variety of enemies keeps it fresh, you never seem to be fighting the same 3 enemies for a prolonged period of time before a new enemy and intro popup. The one downfall of this is just the sear amount of intros for the amount of enemies you face someone slow down the pace of combat, when you go from one room seeing a brand new intro then you walk 10 feet and you see another one. Regardless it doesn't affect the game all that much.Next the actual story. This game has had an amazing story as a selling point. Its ridiculous and over the top, but I'm okay with that as is many of the fans. The game itself is over the top, why wouldn't the story be as well? Though the story is not a selling point, it is in no way a bad story, its just goofy.As for character design, they stay true to the original game. Bayonetta loves her blacks as much as Jeane loves her reds. Enzo and Rodin look about the same but that is neither here nor there. I honestly like Bayonetta's short hair this game a bit more then her over sized bun of the first game. Everyone swears a ridiculous amount, and where it doesn't bother me, it may offend some so if that's not something you're okay with this isn't the game for you.The combat is amazing and fluent, the sheer amount of weapons you can unlock in this game is amazing. Once again you can add weapons to both your hands and feet for a endless amount of combinations (no not really endless but you have a lot of choices). This is the only game where you can wear chainsaws for ice skates that also doubles as a weapon. How can you ask for more? Nintendo did a great job adding their own touch of weapons including chomp chomp and mini Arwings. There is so much to unlock in this game that warrants multiple playthous. You can also unlock weapons from the first game in the second game as well for a even higher weapon count, so start collecting those halos!Now that we have talked about everything I find amazing about this game, ill mention the parts that could of been left out. Bayonetta is a sexy hair witch who uses sex as a weapon, and no I'm not talking like Xena from Goldeneye. She uses her hair as both a weapon and her clothes so as she uses her wicket weave, clothes will start to disappear. And at the end of the fight you will climax, summoning a giant demon to finish off your weakened foes which will leave you completely naked (censored by your own hair of course). Now people seem to think there is a problem with this, which is fine everyone has their own tastes and own opinion which they are entitled to, but the developers are not trying to belittle women by over hyper sexualizing her, but she using as a weapon and it empowers her as she does it. Now i feel there are a few shots that do degrade her, it feels like some of the cut scenes were shot by some 16 year old trying to get a peep at his attractive neighbor. These could of been left out of the game and no one would of missed them i think.Overall this is an amazing game, one of the best if not the best in the genre. The combat is both engaging and simple at the same time. You can hit buttons for easy combos and enjoy the game, or master every combo and master the infinite climate and tag climax modes. There are a few oddly placed camera angles, but don't let that take away from the game. I was a bit upset that this was a Wii U exclusive, but all i did was go out and buy a Wii U. I'm hoping that it sells well (yeah i know i have my hopes up) and we can get more out of this amazing series.\"

2014,Bayonetta 2,"Bayonetta is the same charming and chaotic game the first one was. Best game on Wii U, graphics are stunning, gameplay is perfect, no bugs or glitches. Amazing experience to be had on Wii U."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"THIS IS THE REASON TO BUY A WI U. This game is perfect in almost every aspect. Great music, exciting battles, entertaining story, and interesting characters. The game is not super long but isn't super short either. The only complaint I have is the graphics aren't the greatest, especially when looking at the cutscenes. But that really is the only complaint I have."
2014,Bayonetta 2,Bayonetta 2 is the action game Wii U owners have been waiting for! Immensely fun with more combat depth than meets the eye. Thanks Nintendo for keeping this amazing franchise alive!
2014,Bayonetta 2,"Bayonetta 2 takes what made the original amazing and improves upon that.  Platinum Games and Nintendo have put a lot of care into crafting a perfect action game.  (Also check out the phenomenal Wonderful 101, also by Platinum for the Wii U.  You won't be disappointed.)"
2014,Bayonetta 2,"IMPRESIONANTE, el juego es una OBRA DE ARTE. El sonido es fantastico, la jugabilidad es perfecta, tiene tanta cantidad y calidad de combos que no terminas mas de hacerlos a todos, nunca se vuelve repetitivo."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"One of the best games I've played in a very long time, truly a masterpiece.  This game constantly challenges you in a fun way and keeps things fresh every moment of the way, nothing in this game ever felt tedious or repetitive to me. This game is every Bayonetta fan's wet dream."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"Absolutely flawless action game!Very colorful and astonishing graphics + 60 FPS, fast and fun combat system, AWESOME soundtrack, great cut scenes and story.A must have game for a Wii U owner."
2014,Bayonetta 2,"As i was playing my first run on the hardest available difficulty, i couldn't help but feel conflicted about where this game stood compared to it's predecessor.

I hold Bayonetta 1 dear to my heart. This game felt easy in comparison because of Umbran Climax and the fact that you didn't lose magic when you got hit. I was disappointed by this, and how ""mashy"" it felt because the motion is so fluid. Initial impression of the game sat at an 8.5. HOWEVER after playing for hours in INFINITE CLIMAX lead to an enlightening moment. Everything came together and made perfect sense. The action is so speedy and really tries your reactions and ability to execute the most damage. Enemies so different from one another and having to think ""What weapons should i equip against these guys"". The amount of combos available is improved from the first game since each weapon has specific combos, along with the bread and butter combos so they can be used easily, but also leave room to become masterful with your favorite set. Accessories, Items, all come into play when you have to deal with each fight scenario in this mode. It's the kind of game that starts to reveal it's depth and you start to realize just how far you can go with it. I'm starting to feel as if i'm going to have to play the game for years to come to become satisfied with my skills. The motivation comes from how good it feels to kick ass! The art style, sound, visual effects, enemy reactions, the speed and chaos of everything happening at once! it's a very balletic advance and retreat so finely tuned that it's hard to think of a flaw. Everything that happens can be controlled and you know you messed up if you got hit, it's never the game's fault. The magic builds slowly this time around and when you finally get Umbran Climax in Infinite Climax it feels like a well deserved break where you can pummel your enemies in return and it's oh so satisfying. This thing is Masterfully executed and varied, no cut corners. You can feel the love with so much detail and content packed within. Truly an ode to the old-school gamer with a modern, unrelenting sheen. I'll be playing this game for a couple of years. If you're a hardcore, arcade0style gamer, rest assured that this is an obvious choice. If you're more casual, this game will still feel welcoming, and it might even provoke you to go deep into it's mechanics and become really skilled because it's so inspiring. PERFECT !0\"
2014,Bayonetta 2,"It's a great game, you can play it on gamepad or TV, the history is funny except the end, but when you finish the game, you can play the online mode to get halos, end buy new things or play again the history to unblock a lot of items  (depend of the dificult level)"

If you have a Wii U, or don't, and you have ANY interest in the action genre, GET THIS GAME. Platinum went far and FAR beyond what they even needed to put in this game to make it good and just made it an absolutely unforgettable experience. The gameplay is incredibly solid, expanding on EVERYTHING the first game had to offer. The amount of weapons and characters and items that spice up the gameplay is so vast and incredible. Getting bored of your current combos and setup? That's alright, just switch it up and everything is fresh again. Most weapons just feel very differently rather than reskins of eachother. The combos flow so smoothly and once again Witch Time has proved itself to be one of the best mechanics to ever grace an action game, or video game in general. The amount of trial and error involved with the bosses and enemies creates for a fun and challenging experience, learning the visual cues to enemies attacks is a core feature in this game and is actually really enjoyable considering the enemies are ALWAYS being switched up. Every chapter is filled with so much carnage that I can't specifically pick out any one that I didn't enjoy. It was a ride the whole way through. Even afterwards I cannot stop playing, with all the extra costumes, weapons, bosses, challenges, equipment to unlock and even the new online TAG CLIMAX mode, where you compete for halos and combo scores. There's so much to do that I cannot even fathom myself becoming bored with this title. The story was a HUGE improvement over the first, and was also great, even though the gameplay is the main attraction. The new characters such as Loki were very well developed. No spoilers involved but this game took a really risky plot device (Time Travel) and really actually made it work. Its a split between a sequel and a prequel, as the events do follow after bayonetta 1 but they also do a great job to explain the events that transpired in Bayonetta 1. One very minor annoyance I have is with Tag Climax's matchmaking system being slightly hard to find a partner, but I hope for them to update it in the future. It makes me sad to think that many people are not going to be able to play this game, and I encourage ANYONE to buy this game, or even a Wii U if you don't have one.\"
2014,Bayonetta 2,"I can confirm after beating the game this weekend that this is indeed a masterpiece and a true classic. The graphics, action, combos are just wonderful.

It improves upon the characters and helps us see where they came from. The sexuality has been toned down, despite what everyone is saying. Halfway through, there is basically no sexual imagery outside. I actually tested each weapon on both hands and feet and the only ones that were sexual in any way were the ice/flame throwers, Undine, equipped to the feet. The only negative review I read seemed like a review of the demo or commercial than from someone who actually played it. In the end, that is what you need to do. Play this game. If you're uncertain if you'll like it, at least rent it. If you love DMC, you owe it to yourself to own this game, especially since the original is included for free. The only people I can't recommend this to are people who know that this type of game, stylized hack and slash, isn't for them. This won't change your mind. All cut scenes are skippable and changing the costume to Link will get rid of the minor disrobing in wicked weaves. This is a must own for Wii U owners over the age of 18, but don't give this to your kids unsupervised. The major complaints about the sexuality ignore that it's rated M, so don't give them fodder by being irresponsible.\"

It's a separate problem and I hope Namco Bandai will face some  consequences of their false advertisement/bate and switch tactics.Dark Souls 2 is not a Souls game. It's as simple as that. It's missing everything that made the previous games so special. Starting with the controls, combat mechanics, loot system, game world, boss fights and ending with the difficulty level. It's all gone. Replaced with mechanics that try to ""innovate""and remain similar to the previous game at the same time.The controls feel clunky and unresponsive. The character seems ""heavy"" and the movement is sluggish. Where in previous games the overall rules applied to both the player and the enemies. In Dark Souls 2 there's a different set of rules (stamina, poise, movement etc) for the player and the monsters. Some will have infinite stamina and spam heavy attacks to no end. Other's will ""track"" your movement in the middle of their attack animation. We're talking about spinning 360 degrees while ""channeling"" their attack. Some will even go as far as to reset the attack animation and hit you when they should be recovering from their last attack.The world design is inconsistent and seems out of place. One minute you're fighting a boss in a giant mill just to take the elevator up to the iron keep. The problem is - there's no keep above the mill. Level design is poor at best and the multitude of bon fires makes little sense. In some cases you'll have 4 of them in an area the size of Undead Asylum. You'll find yourself fighting 4 of the most powerful demons in the land to overcome a bit of rubble blocking the way in the forest...Instead of creating interesting enemies From decided to toss a bunch of mobs at you to make up what they lack in design with numbers. The difficulty doesn't come from good design choices but cheap gimmicks. Enemies attacking you through doors or a gate. Bosses with adds during the fight, bosses that ""multiply"" during the fight. It's all based on cheesy gimmicks. Even the fights that suppose to resemble if not imitate boss fights from the previous game are simply boring.Deaths feel cheap. It feels like the game is trolling you by not following it's own rules. The concept of having to die in order to get loot has no place in a Souls game.Overall the game is a huge disappointment.It's got as much in common with previous Souls games as Resident Evil 6 has with the original Resident Evil ;)An average imitation at best.\"

What you're left with is a mediocre hack and slash action romp that looks at times like a PS2 game.Claims made about Dark Souls 2 being developed for the PC natively have turned out to be another marketing gimmick and a bold faced lie. Not a grain of critique was spent on the gaming press about the obvious bad keyboard and mouse controls, that on top of everything else, have almost a half a second delay on every action you take. Xbox controller icons are left in place from the Xbox, proving that the game is just another quick console port. Nowhere it is explained, that you need a controller to properly play the title on PC, which makes sense from a marketing perspective. It should be made clear, that the PC gamer will have to put another 20 euros towards the title in the form of a Xbox controller, but it isn't.Don't believe the fan-boy hype. This is not a PC game, but a bad console port of a game which is overshadowed by the brilliance of the original Dark Souls.\"

2014,Dark Souls 2,"This game would be a solid 10/10 if the PC port wasn't broken. I had to go through various forums and plenty methods to even run the game, which is unforgettable for a 50 release.

2014,Dark Souls 2,"This game is not much fun anymore. It's either input lag or the unfair packs like the Three Sentinels. I don't like to summon people to beat the game, but this one leaves me no other choice - unlike DS1. And that makes me sad and angry. The input lag is annoying as hell. You block at 100% stamina and simple enemies slay through it. The game feels stable, but the fights don't feel balanced.This game is not much fun anymore.

And that makes me sad and angry. The input lag is annoying as hell. You block at 100% stamina and simple enemies slay through it. The game feels stable, but the fights don't feel balanced. It just so frustrating. I know, the game is ment to be hard. I beat DS1 several times. But this one is has not the same feeling. I'm always feeling like being cheated by the engine.Another big issue is the bad durability of weapons. Having a favorite weapon for PvE is almost impossible, because durability is soooo low. I always find myself fighting mobs with my favorite, leveled weapon until they vanish (after 10 - 15 kills) so I can reach a boss with this weapon. And why the hell, don't enemies do damage to themself in close ranges?!!Another big issue is PvP. Too often, the lagging decides who the winner is. Lagstabs, teleports and taking damage after having dodged ten meters away becomes the norm. And you can call yourself lucky not to meet a hacker, because the PC platform is already infested with them. The game has no cheat countermeasures in place. (Why not make the client verify actions on both ends, compare them and just quit the duel when the comparison is negative?) It comes down to use a dashcam (record the PvP matches) and report the hackers to Steam along with a YouTube video.The overall map design feels less creative than in DS1. The zones are more separated so there is not that experience anymore, that you can look from one end of the world to the other. I liked that flavor of DS1 very much and it added to the atmosphere. In DS1 the zones felt like they really belong together.I hope, FromSoftware will deploy some patches to address the input lag and the PvP lagging. Right now, after 40 hours into the game, I'll take a longer break and wait for patches.\"

You can lock your target by pressing the middle mouse button, but it doesn't really make much difference.   I created a cleric and armed myself with a great big metal mace and picked a fight with a little old lady cooking a meal (I'm very brave, I know).   She beat me to death with her ladle.   Not once but many times.  So many times in fact I had to roll a new character to get past the point.In short this is not worth buying on the PC.   For the consoles maybe, but not the PC.\"

I'm still disappointed by how the game turned out and only gets one point more this time, but I want to review it once more from scratch because I want to make the review better, more comprehensible and I want to expand it a little.The game, as a sequel to Dark Souls, feels disappointing. It was stripped down of everything that made Dark Souls 1 good and went through major changes that, for the most part, are changes for the worse. But, let's start with the pros first.Some of the mechanics are executed far better than in the former game. I really liked the presence of Human Effigies as a cure to hollowing instead of ""liquid"" and ""soft"" humanity that could be acquired pretty quickly, but also could be lost by one fatal mistake. In Dark Souls 2, when you die you lose your human form, but you can reverse the hollowing with ease - you don't even have to go back to the bonfire; you can do it immediately.Another thing is that the locations are far larger than they were in Dark Souls 1 so there's a lot more to explore. They are branched too, so very often you can get to the boss by many ways. Plus, some of the locations are truly breathtaking and atmospheric. I'm especially talking about No-man's Wharf and Harvest Valley with astonishing view on the humongous and abstract windmill. This is, unfortunately, too little to make me enjoy the game and give it a higher score, as numerous flaws overshadowed every good aspect the game had.Now for the flaws.Let's start with the key element and core of every Souls game - the combat system. In Dark Souls 1, the combat was very precise. The slow pace of battles and well-made-but-not-perfect animations made you ""feel"" the weight of the equipment, making it a major part of making up tactics against an enemy and your playstyle in general. When you wanted to be a knight armed to the teeth, fighting with a sword bigger than yourself, it was obvious that you had to sacrifice mobility for it, while choosing a leather armor and a scimitar was the exact opposite. In Dark Souls 2 it doesn't matter - every piece of the equipment feels super-light and the only thing indicating you actually travel heavy is the rolling speed - and it feels very forced.The difficulty - another key element of the Souls series, and something it is always proud of. Dark Souls 1 was really unique in this aspect - it was hard and punishing, but very fair at the same time; you always knew what you did wrong and could learn from your mistakes. Dark Souls 2 is nothing like that. After a few deaths you start to notice that most of them weren't your fault, but the game's. The difficulty was amped up just for the sake of being hard, while forgetting to add fairness along the way. You often die from being outnumbered by groups enemies that ""aggro"" all at the same and stunlock you to death or cheap tricks, like mummies in Lost Bastille that can explode and get back on their feet as many times as they want. There's also tracking of your moves present in the enemy AI - they spin around following you during every second of their attack animation, giving you next to no chance to dodge. And to make things even more ""exciting"", your character's movements are now clunky and awkward - he gets tired really quickly and can't dodge properly.Now, the atmosphere. Dark Souls 2 lacks certain peculiarity Demon's Souls and Dark Souls 1 had, giving you generic Dark Fantasy stuff in the veins of Gothic series. Now, it wouldn't be too bad if it had any soul (pun not intended) - despite what I've stated above, almost all locations feel bland and uninspired. Most of the them are either a forest, a castle or something trying too hard to mimic a location from the first game. Literally, none of these made any impression on me, aside from boredom. Another thing is - why are you even in Drangleic. You don't have any purpose of being there, aside from looking for alleged cure for the curse, which you are told right at the beginning, doesn't exist.The level design in this game is absolutely terrible. Aside from the blandness, the locations' arrangement in the world map makes no sense or logic whatsoever. The creators went for Demon Souls-esque hub world with the central point being Majula. It's not a bad thing, if executed properly, but in this game, the locations feel very disconnected. They are always preceeded either a tunnel or a cave and there's no smooth transition between them.Concluding - Dark Souls II is a pretty average game with many technical difficulties and quirky, badly executed mechanics, that may be good for die-hard fans of the series, but for an average gamer, who likes challenging games, it's too unbalanced and badly-made to be enjoyed. Hence only a 5/10.\"

I was disappointed to find that it only showed the XBox controller buttons in place of the keyboard commands and it took some rebinding to get keyboard and mouse rebound to a functional set-up but I was ultimately treated to a fantastic game. The atmosphere in Dark Souls, as well as its environmental storytelling and bosses were all phenomenal, and I've sunk many long hours into the game.I've therefore been waiting with a great deal of excitement for Dark Souls 2. Dark Souls was a rushed port in response to high PC player demand so some problems were expected, but surely there wouldn't be any with Dark Souls 2, which was developed for PC simultaneously ... Wrong! The Xbox controller prompts are back. The default bindings are appalling, and many keyboard buttons can't actually be bound for no apparent reason. The controls are laggy in a game were rapid responsiveness are key. There's also the more minor issue of the massive downgrade in the lighting of the game, which hopefully may be fixed at some point for PC.In short, this is once again an embarrassingly bad port, and I'd advise waiting for fixes from the developers or modders before getting it. What I've played of the game itself seems great, but it's simply not a finished product and I object to being sold games in this condition.\"

The backlash was pretty hard on them"" well yesterday I bought this game (the sequel) and I'm already feeling like I will need those guys who fixed the first one again! Really?. For starters, it doesn't initiate if I have my controller plugged onto the pc, it just crashes, so I cant play it with my controller (not that I would like it but, It's the recommended way right?), amusingly enough, it doesnt seems to matter if I have my nostromo plugged into the pc or not (I tried unplugging it, plugging it with the controller, plugging the controller alone, etc) and guess why it doesnt matter? because it doesnt recognize it. So that leaves me out with traditional keyboard and mouse, so ok. I try to start the game: CTD!, try it again, CTD when I first move! I'm starting to have a Deja vu from the first game (which had several graphics problems that luckily those fixes from those saviors fixed for me, which made my game CTD), so I use Nvidia control center to deactivate several graphics options (rather force them) and the game stops CTDing. Yay! Who needs graphics, right? well turns out the controlls are a damn mess. Better than the first one, but not by far. So I end up getting really pissed and as a result I come here to warn people that if you buy this and have the astonishing luck that it works like intended, you will have to deal with camera and key binding issues that will have you dead not because the game is difficult, but because you will feel paralyzed by the control system.So, I'm planning to get a refund on this garbage and move on to something better from another company, a company that doesnt have his fans fixing their games for them...

The difficulty was not the main focus, and interviews with the director shows that. The director of Dark Souls 2 took a very different approach, and it shows in even the dialogue of the game.In the first few cutscenes, the player is told ""you're going to die and lose souls over and over again"", it is almost like that is coming from the developers. This wasn't seen in the previous games.The gameplay suffers from this too. The game tries way too hard to surprise you and punish you. with very predicable surprises at almost every single corner.An example of this that is very evident is the first level of the game.I'm not going to spoil it, but i'll just say that in the previous Souls games, the first levels were pretty good tutorials with fair enemies. It isn't like that in this one, you'll see what I mean if you play it.The new mechanics the game throws at you are a different, fresh, new experience.Stats are distributed differently, movement feels different, healing items are awful now, and enemies have different movesets. It's interesting to play, and in some aspects, much more difficult.I was kind of worried this game would be a casualized version of the first, I can say that I'm not dissapointed.Onto the technical aspects:The PC port is very good, a definite improvement over the first. Easy 1080p and 60 fps on an AMD 7850.I can't judge the Mouse+Keyboard controls though, because I haven't tried, but honestly, who would? A controller is a must for these types of games.Loading screens are almost non-existent just like the firstAlso, Alt+F4 is beautiful, try it out when you play it, it saves your game, fades out and exits - A counter against people that will quit during PvPSteamworks for this game is amazing! There is no ""summoning failed"" message like in the first, summoning and invading people are almost instant! The connectivity is nice and a great improvement over Games for Windows Live in the first Dark Souls.Overall, I'd recommend Dark Souls 2.It's decent, but I still like Demon's Souls the best.\"
2014,Dark Souls 2,"After working for 40 hours to get this game to launch, the few minutes I played were terrible. Even as the game feels like a PC port, it doesn't even feel like they tried. Sure, the game looks better than the first one, but I wouldn't care if it looked terrible. The gameplay is what matters and that's what they completely broke. BESIDES not being able to even launch the game. GG."

As well as a strong enemy variety and well animated/telegraphed attacks allow you to see actual tactics being used.Enemies will charge at you when they see you healing, some of them can heal, and others can be baited into putting up their shield (if they have one) just by pulling out a ranged weapon.\"

This is apparently meant for a control on PC, which is just stupid, but as someone who doesn't have one I don't want to go spend money to play a game after I already spent $50 bucks for the game itself!!!The weird console controller layout of the controls for PC makes the actual game barely playable. It doesn't seem that hard yet, the biggest struggle I find is the fact that the controls are impossible to navigate when reacting to enemies. The main reason I die is because I can't control the character enough to react to the game itself which is the worst problem you can have for a game. Another obvious flaw is the fact that when your going through tutorial area in the beginning all of the helpful signs are still in console controls! So you can't even translate to what in the world I'm suppose to do on PC to get that to happen. They even have the menus in the game still on console controls. Obvious this game is not meant for PC yet...  Nothing is hard its just lack of responsiveness and control for the user....\"

That's what ""Dark Souls 2"" is.  Not only is it obviously a terrible PC port despite claims that PC was the lead platform (then why do enemies in the distance only animate at 30fps, why is the UI so obviously designed for console, why is M&K functionality still garbage?), but the game itself plays worse than a ""Souls"" game ever has.This is likely in large part due to this being the first ""Souls"" game that isn't made by the original ""Souls"" team.  If you need more info on this, google it, but bottom line is ""From Software"" felt that the ""Souls"" franchise had become successful enough that the people who made it good could do... whatever they're doing now, and the next entry (Dark Souls 2) could be made by ""From Software's"" B-Team.Playing as Melee is pretty much broken this time around, as enemy tracking is impossible to outpace.  In DeS/DS1, you could see them winding up for an attack and roll out of the way, but now they spin on a dime and do not stop their facing until their attack has landed.  So, instead of rolling when you see the attack coming, you have to roll during the window right before the attack lands, which is much, *much* more punishing, and *far* more difficult to execute.  DeS/DS1 were punishing but fair, DS2 is punishing for the sake of being punishing.Gone as well is the tactical one-on-one combat, not just because of the above, but because of the game's tendency to throw entire rooms of enemies at you at once.  In DeS/DS1, you could lure enemies off large packs to make them easier to handle, or if you alerted one enemy in the room you would only pull that enemy and *maybe* whoever was nearby.  In DS2, if you trigger on enemy, you trigger every enemy in the room.  This makes the focus on co-op much heavier, as you're going to *need* two other people around you spamming attacks just to clear more areas.The vast majority of boss fights are copy-pasted from DS1, and the ""new"" boss fights are just bosses that look new but use mechanics that anyone who's already played DeS/DS1 will immediately recognize.There's also the issue of item durability.  In this game, your weapons are going to degrade at a much faster rate, and the only way to restore them is to use extremely rare and highly expensive Repair powders, or resting at a bonfire.  This means that, more often than not, your favorite main-hand weapon is going to be rendered unusuable before you reach the next checkpoint.  There's also a bug in the game that makes it so swinging your weapon through enemies who are in the ""dying"" animation, or swinging your weapon and having it clip a co-op phantom, will cause it to degrade at 300% the rate as well.  These two combined make for a more naggy, OCD melee-combat experience.This is also the first time I've played a ""Souls"" game and felt like it needed a map.  ""Demon's Souls"" was split into 5 seperate worlds which made it easy to keep track of things in your head, ""Dark Souls"" was open world but everything fit together very cohesively so again it was easy to keep track of things.  ""Dark Souls 2"" feels like they threw a bunch of zones together and didn't care about how they connected to each other, they just wanted them there.  Navigating is an absolute chore.  It's entirely possible to be exploring your first time, and find yourself stuck in areas where the only way to get out is to die by jumping into a chasm/pit, or returning to a bonfire (with a spell or item).  ""DeS"" and ""DS1"" had *some* of this as well, but not nearly to the extent that ""DS2"" does.The ""Souls"" series is all about overcoming unpleasant surprises, but the only unpleasant surprise ""Dark Souls 2"" delivers is that of a mishandled entry in a beloved franchise, with the only feeling left afterwards being that of wasted time.  ""From Software"" decided they could save money by hiring lesser talent to make a game that'd get success by brand name alone.  And sales-wise, it probably worked, but from now I'm going to be far more leary when I look at the next title from ""From Software"".It's very disappointing to recognize what ""From"" has done here, because it means that the ""Souls"" franchise will never be as good as it used to.  Yet for how good the last two games were, there was still a lot of room for improvement, and now we'll never know how good this series could've been.  Like everything else, it comes down to the people in charge intentionally ruining something so they can increase their profit by a few percent.  Once that starts, there's no going back.  If they feel like they have ""f u"" money after just two big titles, then quality from here on out is only going to get worse for ""From"" titles.\"

I feel like I'm new again, holding up my shield while slowly turning the next corner, and hoping not to come across some new trap.For all the hate it's getting for not being exactly like Dark Souls, I can agree with some of the points.  The weapons degrade at a shocking rate, although I am still early on (3 hours in) so who knows, upgrading may fix that.  And of course, we could discuss the lighting engine and all that fluff, but it's been said and done before.  We know it's not what was shown at E3 in 2013, nor what was in the beta, but whatever.  Although, I still feel that it's trying a bit too hard to give the lighting effects a chance, because nothing actually looks, you know, dark yet... Here's hoping The Gutter proves this point moot.Anyways, first impressions aside, I'm glad I purchased this game, and I plan on playing it for a good long time.  Is it as good as the first, I don't think so (although I'm a admittedly jaded), but it doesn't have to be... it's its own game that stands up just fine with the Souls line.

It's not an issue or a bug they need to fix nor is it ""clunky"", it's how they chose to implement multi-player into the game. Yes, the keyboard and mouse controls are terrible, but this is a studio that doesn't make PC games, Dark Souls was their first attempt at a port and Dark Souls 2 is their second. It blows that you have to use a controller to play the game comfortably but you don't HAVE to. I used  the PC controls for about 3 hours and while they are a bit odd and uncomfortable, the game is completely playable using keyboard and mouse. Now lets actually talk about the game.Now Dark Souls 2 is an amazing game, from the visuals to the gameplay, it stays true to the Souls series. The game looks brilliant and it's color palette is wonderful, they optimized the heck out of it and the game runs incredibly even with all the settings turned up to the max on mid-range PC's.I feel it's a bit harder than the first as well, and the main reason behind that is that weapons now degrade a lot faster. Enemies are more aggressive and bosses need a little bit more strategy than previous titles, more than once I have underestimated the enemy and in the end paid dearly for my mistake. Control responsiveness is great, never once have I been screwed over because my input didn't go through. The world you're in is amazing, the level design is just as good as Dark Souls 1, and the enviroment feels more immersive. My only one gripe is that your weapons break far to quickly, you can now equip three items to each hand, but that doesn't make up for it. It's really annoying how quickly you can get into trouble when your weapon breaks and you have to high-tail out of a fight. Not even upgrading your weapon improves it's durability. There is and item you can equip that you find later in-game that slows the degradation of you weapons, so that's nice, but I wish upgrading improved their durability. Dark Souls 2 is everything I hoped for in another Souls game, and anyone that says their a Souls fan and then says they were disappointed with this game is not a Souls fan.\"

I should start with s of this game. It is dark souls,  it has beautiful lore, awesome gameplay, magnificent views (my favourite location is Dragon Aerie), hardness and my favourite... you kill bosses and progress not with level or high damage sword, but with skill. Some bosses are unique and interesting. PVP or Jolly co-op is just awesome (after I defeat boss on my own, I like to help others). There are added tons of items and mechanics what make game better. And the ending is quite good.Now about cons. and I found only one big flaw what made me sad, it is bosses. The problem is, that there is too much knight bosses, and sometimes they even repeat. Few bosses are just copy/pasted from ds1(like scorpion lady(ds2) and spider lady(ds1)). Well I must admit that ornstein is copied for lore and his attack are different, so I wouldn't count him as flaw, but sometimes you just feel thet it's too familiar, in a bad way. Another con for bosses is hardness, you meat Persuer (just a knight) and this is your nightmare(and yes, only after I defeated him, I received an info of 90% easy damage, but the way I defeated him as knight was even better) . Then you meet an awesome dragon in cage and he dies from 10 hits or you meet Lord of Giants( who should be hard as hell and awesome in this way)... I killed him on 2nd try. And final boss wasn't **** but he/she was disappointingIn sum-up I can say, that this is great sequel, not perfect, but great one. If you just compare with what came out in 2013/2014 (bugged and not finished bf4, simcity, Rome:TW2 and others) DS2 is best right now you can get in 2014(for me). DS2 receive from me 8.5/10.

Here, the player will learn how to parry, backstab and all the other skilful combat manoeuvres that made Dark Souls 1 so rewarding.Alongside a more refined gameplay, Dark Souls 2 is paired with a deep storyline to rival that of even Skyrim and similar titles, despite being completely separate from its previous title, both are still, unsurprisingly, set in the DS universe. The player begins as a cursed undead, doomed to remain between life and death forever and to eventually become \hollow\, a zombie-like being with no memories or purpose. In order to break this curse, the player is tasked with collecting four Great Souls from powerful ancient beings known as Old Ones, an undoubtedly daunting mission.The aesthetics of the game perfectly complement its lonely, harsh atmosphere, the graphics are very realistic and the fantasy element of the game is only really shown in the terrifying beasts and ghouls that face the player, even they are eerily realistic. As for the technical side, I did personally experience occasional framerate issues even on PC, let alone consoles at the time. I, however, did find the game very playable despite this.The loneliness of the game creates perfectly compliments its NPCs and artificial intelligence, in the sense that the player would rather be relieved by the company of anyone than have to go through the whole game alone. For example, by the end of the game most have become ridiculously attached to the being known as \snuggly\, who is never even actually seen in the game, though is assumed to be a crow-like humanoid and who\s character is developed through Easter eggs and adorably broken English.In summary, Dark Souls 2 is my personal favourite of the series, surpassing both its previous title and even its following title with unrivaled atmosphere and terrifyingly monstrous bosses.\"

2014,Dark Souls 2,"There's a lot to say about this game so I broke it down into three catagories: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. Skip to the bottom for a synopsis.The Good:+DaS2 is still huge.

Much of the lore is fleshed out via NPCs as you journey throughThere's a lot to say about this game so I broke it down into three catagories: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. Skip to the bottom for a synopsis.The Good:+DaS2 is still huge. There is a lot to explore and there's plenty of hidden areas with tough bosses.+A larger, more open game world.+More character interaction. Much of the lore is fleshed out via NPCs as you journey through the game, with characters having more to say (and more to sell).+Better networking and better co-op. A new ring essentially makes your summon sign only visible to your friends.+More accessible covenants. While most covenants in DaS you had to jump through hoops just to find, overall DaS2's covenants are easy to join and more enjoyable to level.+Dual wielding is greatly improved. Power stancing lets you swing both your weapons in new combos.+Magic is greatly expanded and includes a new catagory for Hexes.+Greatly improved NG+ experience. Bosses drop new items, new enemies spawn in special areas, and some bosses gain new mechanics.The Bad (huge problems that will [probably] never change):-Terrible map design. Most levels are very simplistic, with some even being a straight corridor from beginning to the token boss.-Heavily unbalanced covenant rank-up requirements. Heirs of the Sun's 30 sunlight medals can be achieved in a few hours for max rank, while BoB & Blue Sentinel's 500 kills requires NG+ or nonstop victories in the arena (losses count as -1 rank points... why?).-Overabundance of forgettable, humanoid bosses. Some are recycled later in the game (or later playthroughs) as normal mobs or bosses. Many bosses have similar attack patterns and fall apart when you circle strafe and roll.-Swarms of enemies everywhere. While DaS focused on intense 1v1 fights, there were occasional cannon fodder slaughterfests. DaS 2 will regularly throw multiple heavily armored & long-reaching (polearms, ultra greatswords) enemies at you.-Parrying and riposting are harder to perform and less rewarding. Even if you manage to riposte, you can now be damaged while riposting by the swarms of enemies in DaS 2.-Overabundance of healing items and consumables. There's no reason to start as a Cleric because of 3 different purchasable lifegems (HoT consumable), 12 Estus Flask+5s (easily attained on first playthrough), and 8 other consumables that restore spells or cure statuses on top of healing you.-Terrible plot and story telling. The last few levels (and especially the ending cutscene) make no sense and it feels like the devs just wanted to add ""cool"" stuff to pad the game.The Ugly (nitpicking and balance problems):*Iframes have been removed from backstabs, ripostes, using fog gates, doors, and other environmental actions.*Roll iframes & estus flask drinking speed are tied to a stat.*No pyromancer starting class. You have to get roughly through one-quarter of the game to find your first flame and pyromancy and its very easy to miss.*Tons of balance issues with both PvE & PvP. Near the end of the first playthrough magic becomes very powerful, even in PvE. In PvP most spells worth using in PvP will kill you in 1 or 2 hits even with strong magic defense.*No un-cracked Red/Blue Eye Orbs and cracked orbs aren't sold by NPCs until NG+.*Changes to equip load mean everyone is some kind of hybrid class, doing normal rolls while wearing full Havels with a cloud of Persuers- err, i mean Affinity over them while waving a flaming katana around.*Cheaters are currently a huge issue on the PC version. You can now be invaded while Hollow and not being human is a big HP handicap, meaning you will run into cheaters much more often than in DaS.Dark Souls 2 isn't much of an honest sequel to Dark Souls; Being more akin to a numbered Final Fantasy sequel, with the only connection between the two being some equipment & spell names as far as I can tell. While it will win tons of GOTY awards, it also has a ton of issues that need to be addressed before it will be remembered as fondly as its predecessor. DaS 2 is definitely worth playing, but it feels like a rushed cash-in made by a B-Team who were told how a Souls game should be made (and then went and did their own thing anyway). Hopefully FromSoft's next Souls game has some actual soul to it... Otherwise we might just end up with another Armored Core situation with a new half-assed sequel being pooped out every few years.\"

2014,Dark Souls 2,"I think that these negative reviews are probably just from people who can't figure out how to play the game! This is a masterpiece of a game, the graphics are beautiful and the challenge can be rage inducing but when you beat it, there is no greater feeling in the world."

The most annoying thing I have noticed is the lack of boss variation. Most of the bosses are some form of humanoid creature or knight. There is the big Jabba The Hut looking thing and also the rat king boss but other than that they are all the same. I beat 90% of the bosses by either strafing to the left or right because of this. If you some how could not beat a boss you could always summon the phantom NPC to help you which are there for most bosses and since it is really easy to stay human that option is always there and make the fight an almost guaranteed win. The dragons were just plain weak which was very disappointing. There really were no mini bosses that were a challenge. It seems the developers made it sound like it was going to be much more difficult to get more sales because it was definitely  not a challenge. The boss weapons were all crap. No point in even saving the boss souls for them because the ones that were good had some major flaw like the durability was low or something. Dying is not a big deal in Dark Souls II because you only lose a very small fraction of your health. On my third character I was able to make it through the entire game and only died about 7 times due to stupidity such as falling off a cliff or something. The conditions, such as poison or curse, barely do anything to even a character that is not resistant to them. On top of that the targeting system is jacked and rarely works how you want it to. The covenants are great if you love multiplayer but if you do not there are only a select few that will benefit you offline. With that being said there are a few things that were good about the game.One thing I thought was a major improvement was the PC controls. They are a little confusing at first but after a while of messing around with them it is just like playing any other game. The graphics are awesome and the developers did an amazing job on that but can also be scaled down far enough to work on a crap PC. The bonfire jumping, although it makes the game easier, I thought it was an improvement. There are also many easily missed secrets which may keep you interested through your second play through.I would rate the individual parts of the game as follows.Graphics 10/10Controls 9/10Gameplay 2/10Difficulty 1/10Multiplayer 5/10To sum this up I would say it is a fun game but if you want a true souls game play Demon Souls or the first Dark Souls because the developers like many others are just pumping these things out for money now.\"

2014,Dark Souls 2,"This is my revised review without playing DS1 before . At my first time play through, I gave this game 0 out of 10 because of terrible port.

I spent 100 hours+ with this game, played it till the end and still want to play more so I wouldThis is my revised review without playing DS1 before . At my first time play through, I gave this game 0 out of 10 because of terrible port. I almost ditched this game but on a second thought, I gave it another try by overlooking bad port and poor graphic. This time I really enjoyed the game. I spent 100 hours+ with this game, played it till the end and still want to play more so I would like you guys to read my review first, you will understand why this game has a lot of lovers and haters at the same time, and whether this game suits your taste or not.Let me start with the bad port first. As many negative reviewers said, this game has a abysmal console port EVER !. If you have controller, you will not have the issue. Nevertheless, if you have only keyboard + mouse, You will have to spend 1-2 hours  learning how to play with keyboard. Even after you know how to do every moveset, you still have a delay. Anyway,  you still can play this game with keyboard + mouse. Me too struggled at first but now totally fine.Second, the Graphic is unacceptable if you compare to PC RPG game nowadays. So even without keyboard issue, this game cannot get perfect score. No zooming to the face when you talk to NPC, NPC mouth is shut. Character creation is bare bone. Begining cinematic is a lie. You will not see cinematic like that again in the game. The only cinematics left are seen when you fight a boss, which most of them are mediocre.Third, there is a very little story in this game, or I could say this game has no story at all, no quest or whatever. You just have to put yourself through the end of the game, that's it. This game is pretty much like a hack&slash game if you ask me.However, even with these very poor features, this game still has its huge merit, that is THE CHARISMA of the game. or in another word, THE CHALLENGE, which is very unique if it is compared with most RPG games in the market. EVERY TIME YOU DIE, THE GAME WILL PUNISH YOU, this concept adds the unique tense that I never had before in other games. Every death will decrease your maximum HP 5 - 10% per time and If you die again before getting to the spot that you just died, you will lose all your souls accumulated, which can be a huge loss since you have to use souls to up your lv and spend stuffs. Of course, you cannot save your game. This rule will force you focus on the game and be cautious to every corner, traps and  enemy. ""I must survive ! I must not die"" these are what you will chanting in your mind while playing the game. There are checkpoints (bonfire) available though, however many times checkpoints are far from each other, so if you die along the way, you will have to run from the start again.Game Mechanic is also very awesome. I blamed it in my first review but that was because of my inexperience. This game when you click attack button, it means you just committed the attack, you cannot cancel it and you will be vulnerable at that time. This force you to play more carefully. Most of enemies in the game can be defeated only  by skill not by your lv or equipment.  You just need to understand its attack-pattern, dodge and attack at the right time. Boss's fights are so epic and super excited. I still remember how hard when I fought will Last Giant, the first boss and Pursuer, the second boss first time. I spent more than 2 hours to beat them. I died a lot, many times I made mistakes just when I was about to finished them off ( wanna cry). I even almost gave up. However, after I defeated them, I felt very satisfied. The feeling that you conquer the game on your own perseverance will emerge.To me, there is no game giving the winning feeling as big as this one.Multiplayer, another thing that I must mention no matter what. This game has a VERY GOOD MULTIPLAYER, which I've never expected from RPG games. PVE, you can summon your friends to help you fight or can go to help in your friend's world. Thus, if you feel like the game is too hard, you can summon help anytime. More importantly, PVP IS THE BEAST, fighting the others is very fun. A lot of weapon have its own moveset, making the fight very diverse. There is no best weapon nor best armor in the game. Moreover, you can invade the other's world forcefully by using items, ambush poor guy while he is busy with his monsters, or be invaded yourself, or even become a helper who helps newbie fight with invader. However, for me, in a high lv 200+, the game will start to be less fun in PVP since everyone will use the same style due to the stat  soft cap and soul mem matching is unreasonable.In sum, I have a lot of fun with this game but I cannot give perfect score because those bad aspects. So here is my quick brief reviewIF YOU WANT THE GAME WITH AN AMAZING GRAPHIC, EXCELLENT STORY that has various of choices and memorable NPC. This game is absolutely à¹NOT for you.However, IF YOU WANT A INTENSE CHALLENGING GAMEPLAY and GREAT PVP, this game is a must try !. I hope DLC will come soon :>\"

When you finally get through that tough boss that took you hours to finish, its one of the most rewarding experiences you will ever feel.  Besides the gameplay (which is near perfect), the lore is also a very interesting part of the game's story as well.  Dark souls 2 isnt direct with its story line at all.  In fact, the only way your going to  end up understanding most of the story behind different bosses, or the land of Drangilec, is by reading up on the history of specific  items and souls you get through the game.  You'll also be able to talk to different npcs during your playthrough.  The reason im not giving this game a perfect score is because doesnt feel all that original.  Many bosses, weapons, and even some different areas of the game all feel like they were almost copy and pasted from the original Dark Souls.  Also, the game doesnt always feel 100% fair like the first one did.  What i mean by this, is that in some areas of the game, you'll encounter enemies or bosses that'll slide and move in your direction as you try to evade.

Because Hearthstone is about as pay 2 win as you can get without placing a button that says. ""Click to win ($4.99)""First the positives. Hearthstone is a functional game that has decent flow to it. It has minimal issues with bugs and runs well on older machines. The game does have a rather kitschy feel to it, as well as a sense of self-parody for the WoW mythos. The gameplay is smooth and the interface is easy to navigate.Hearthstone falls short in several areas, however. For example, players must either buy boosters or earn them at an extremely slow rate, made slower by the fact that in-game currency is only earned through victories. Players are started out with the same set of basic cards and must grind packs or buy them. There are daily quests, but they usually involve winning matches to gain extra gold. While it is possible to win with the basic set of cards, many of the pack cards far stronger and some are actually game breaking. Which makes a player who pays for packs far more likely to get ahead in the game. Discounting daily quests, booster packs can be obtained with gold for WINNING 30 matches. I emphasize that intentionally, as no gold is gained for a loss, essentially punishing the player who is learning or can't afford to buy cards. Exacerbating this problem is that matchmaking is quite poor, and so called ""Casual Matches"" are well populated with ""noob-stompers"" looking for easy gold which slows down the rate which gold and subsequently packs are acquired. Another problem with the game is there is a lack of balance. Priest and Hunter decks have access to cards that swing the game too much, IMO. (Mind Control and Unleash the Hounds being the most infamous.) Other classes also have cards of this type but not nearly as strong or numerous.In addition to this is the Arena mode which can be entered for 150 game gold. (Whereas a pack costs 100 gold.) But can be instead accessed with cash, You are given a choice of three random decks and them create a deck from card options given to you. Everything is RNG based. Then you take your deck and play other players must win as many games as you can (up to 9) before losing 3. The mode rewards you with booster packs, gold and dust depending on how well you did. If you did well you will get more, if you did poorly you will get little and possibly not get a pack. Again this feeds into the demand that players win in order to progress.There is also a way to craft cards using the aforementioned dust. Although it is not at all efficient, cards can be broken down using dust, but creating one of a certain rank requires the equivalent amount of dust from breaking down 8 cards of the same rank. Like everything in this game it is a slow process, crafted to exasperate the player and make the cash shop more appealing.Finally the game deserves criticism for doing little to instruct new players in basic deckbuilding strategies. And has a notably annoying ""response"" system that many players use to taunt their opponents. It can be disabled, but only for the duration of your current game and must be disabled every single time you play a game. There is also no function for players to trade cards which was omitted simply to push the P2W game system.Hearthstone is hardly the worst game out there right now. In fact it could be good, but the P2W model and the frustrations involved with CCG mechanics that are quite faithfully ported over from card games like Magic: the Gathering are front and center without any of the social benefits.  A potentially good, game but ruined by the P2W model. Only the most diehard CCG enthusiasts with money to burn will enjoy this game. For everyone else, it's more frustration than actual fun.\"

Then you got the fact that some classes will hands down destroy your deck. They expect you to plan for everything and your mother in 30 cards.Bout the only thing going for this game are it's aesthetics. OOoooo shiny colors and explosions Ahhhh *watches as 2 flame strikes, 2 arcane explosions, (insert aoe and/or removal spell(s))*In terms of gameplay, there is none. Figuratively. Literally. You draw cards. You play what you can since the number of options in this game is extremely limited. You hope your opponent doesn't have that card. He does. You curse at the computer and a terrible chat system (maybe it was intentional) that doesn't allow any communication between you or your opponent between 6 generic phrases. The end. I understand how card games are supposed to be luck based but the main problem is this game is too luck based and too damn simplified. The main crux being there is absolutely no counter play. None. They picked up counter play and threw it out of a 10 story window. You got what you can do on your turn and then you watch as your opponent does what he does. If that happens to be the complete destruction of your side of the field from a card he just drew from the top of his deck; well too bad (justification from hearthstone fanatics: should've planned for that). Magic allows you to choose what creature you want defending. Yu Gi Oh has trap cards. Even the damn Blizzard World of Warcraft card game had counter play. What's that you say? Secrets? You mean the ""trap"" cards only 3/9 of the classes have and that there are only 3 of? You can literally google ""Mage Traps Hearthstone"" and it'll show you the whopping list of 5 possible traps (2 of which are crap that a mage should never have) allowing you to easily sidestep these token cards.Which leads me to the next point. Hearthstone has 465 playable cards; about 30 of them are legendaries basically making them unaccesible for anyone but the lucky or the pay-to-win. Furthermore of these cards about 80 are useful. Why? It's the meta. All of the rest are useless. They're situational, inefficient, or just downright bad. One of the fun things typical card games do is allow you to experiment; in Hearthstone if you experiment you lose. That simple. Of course unless you go against someone else who doesn't get the meta.But back to the legendary issue. They are the meta breakers simply because they're rare. Rare and downright unbalanced; Now I do have to give Blizzard props, they tried to balance this. Unfortunately the way they tried to balance it is figuratively mentally retarded. They added removal cards. As in if you don't like a card you pick it out and say gtfo. Now I'm all for arbitrary death but seriously...in an already luck base card game. Now as if getting lucky wasn't enough you can get really lucky or more likely unlikely as in that card you finally managed to get out and buffed for the win now gets destroyed cause the other guy top decks a ""kill-anything-you-feel-like-card"". Well done except that took literally no skill. It also means that the luck based level of the game has now dropped down to the point that a 2 year old with the same cards as a professional player can now beat that player. Good job blizzard. All in all excellent work on the balance and luck issues. I do have to give it a one thought because the graphics are nice and the game is mind-numbingly simplistic. Also at least it wasn't Diablo 3 Blizzard. At least it wasn't.Things to make it bearable: In ranked, before a match begins allow people to see what class they're up against and allow them to build a deck. Use a removal card to remove the removal cards from this game completely permanently. Nerf the legends. This isn't league. Set the cards so a random number generator doesn't determine whether you live or die.p.s. It's quite sad when the signature game mode (which you have to pay to play) is Arena Mode. When literally your entire deck is composed of RANDOM cards.\"

There are fun animations for summoning and attacks and for other actions on the board that can really be entertaining as well. and there are several kinds of decks you can build and a decent practice mode.Unfortunately any entertainment value is destroyed by several factors. All deck types have their own unique Hero ability and set of basic cards, while no one class has any clear advantage on the other 8, each class has gimmicky cards that can make any strategy for attack or defense suddenly impossible to beat or impossible to lose against.  While there is no perfect deck type which is a plus, any strategy into building a deck only usually makes a deck good against one or two other types of deck and easily defeated by many othersNew players do get a decent set of basic cards but the card draw system is a complete mess. You gain additional mana crystals each turn that let you summon more powerful creatures and spells but the deck draw system is far to fond of pulling cards you can't use long before you could actually use them, regardless of how many cards have that cost in your deck. Out of the 30 maximum cards in a deck i tested 30 games with 24 cards with a mana cost of 4 or less and 3 cards of 5 mana and 3 above that, of the 30 games played I got the 5+ cards either with the Initial draw, after the mulligan option of discarding some or all of a starting hand for different cards, (which is a nice feature even if it doesn't seem to help alot) or within the first 4 turns. One of those three options occurred during every one of those 30 tests. Often I would get the same cards i discarded with the mulligan back into the starting hand again.I would not call this pay to win, pay to catch up with players in the Beta for amount of cards? Yes. It is possible to buy more cards either directly for cash or with gold earned in game.  You can also get cards by doing well in the arena mode, which is where you build a deck out of random sets of 3 cards untill you have 30. the better you do in arena the better your reward, be it gold, cards or dust. Dust is a crafting material that you gain for disenchanting spare cards from your latter deck as you can only have 2 of each kind of a card in ladder deck. Dust is used to make any card you want, with some cards costing more than others. While this is a good feature to let players pick certain cards, you gain miniscule amounts of dust for disenchanting most cards. Gold earned in game is also earned at low rates, 10 for the first 3 wins of the day and 40 for completeing a mission. It costs 100 gold for 1 pack at the card shop and 150 gold to try your hand at arena mode without paying the $2.00 real money entry fee. So largely its 2 days of playing for a deck of cards or 3 days for an arena attempt. Its also about 2 dollars for a pack of cards as well, with various bundles for more packs for more money available.I cannot recommend spending any money on this game, as they are obviously hoping that you will either spend more money buying packs and attempting the arena  enough times that they will make more money off you than they would for a retail game like Diablo or Starcraft. All in all, the gimmicky nature of the decks and the poor randomization for drawing cards from your deck make Hearthstone the fastest way to have a bad time short of a sudden injury.

On the first hand, you have a card game that's clearly better than all the rest, and well done. It gives a good first impression. It runs well. It looks well. All of the cards are recognizable from the WoW source material that they are drawn from. The UI is convenient. It doesn't do any stupid crap like having cards sidewaysor upside down like certain other games(No idea why they do that, quite stupid for a video game where 2 players are not sharing the same monitor). It even allows you to disenchant unwanted cards to build up a dust supply to eventually craft what you do want, something other games don't have. This is a real game seller. Those other crappy card games just expect you to lottery until you get what you want, to hell with copies or cards you don't want piling up.But on the other hand, you have a game that is being treated very poorly by its developer's. Not only is the balance in the game non existent because it focuses on a meta instead(Blizzard openly admits this)... but It's now over run with bots that they still refuse to do anything about. Bots are farming this game day and night now, so don't be surprised when you fight the same exact bot decks again and again. The bots have even infested the forum now, creating a slew of garbage spam threads every single night that persist until they're pushed off the next morning by real posters. Blizzard couldn't care less about these issues. They don't even use their own forum most of the time, opting instead to go to social networking sites such as Twitter or Facebook. That means that instead of caring about the users they have, they care only about drawing more in, which is the overall feel of the game. It's one big cash grab of a product, probably made solely to draw in revenue which they're now no doubt using on Heroes of the Storm instead of using it to improve Hearthstone.The competitive play for the game is in shambles because of it's non existent balance. Every player with a class runs the same exact build because, when you run a meta, that's how it works. They all run what is best, to hell with anything else. If you come into this expecting a balanced game... you're going to be gravely disappointed. Half of the cards in this game are garbage no one uses or has any reason to use, while a small fraction are best and auto slotted into every deck. Many players like myself(1k+ posts) have spent all year trying to talk Blizzard into fixing this game, including all problems I've pointed out here, and we've only gotten deaf ears turned to us. As usual with Blizzard games, the months roll by and little to no problems are actually addressed. They take the game down for entire days to apply no patches, or patch with 1 or 2 lines in the patch log that didn't fix anything people were trying to get them to look at for months on end.The biggest thing they did for the game this year was add Naxx, which basically just hands out a slew of cards very cheaply to anyone that wants them. Naxx is an all around bust in my opinion. It's too cheap to enter, too easy to beat, then has no reason to even replay it once you got all the cards. The only difficulty even in this ""adventure"" is Heroic Mode, which makes the bosses impossibly difficult without tailor made decks to beat them. And what's your reward for all the trouble? Nothing. You get nothing for beating every boss on Heroic except a card back no one cares about. It needed a middle ground, instead of having a ""too easy"" mode that hands out all the cards, and a ""too hard"" mode that gives you nothing for your trouble. Bust. Just a bust. Replayability would have helped, but there is none for it. After doing all of Naxx, I finally decided to retire. I've waited long enough for Blizzard to do something with this title, anything other than treating it like a lottery machine.I should point out the embarrassing Kel Thuzad voice acting. What used to be an evil Lich is now a clown cracking jokes for bored children at a birthday party. That sets the overall tone and disappointing nature of the game perfectly.But like all controversial games with nothing but biased fanboy or hater reviews; it's both over rated and under rated. Speaking from an objective point of view, it's not a bad game, it just isn't as great as it easily could have been if Blizzard cared at all about it. I'd like to point out that despite what a lot of ignorant people say, it is not P2W either. You can competitive with cheap decks; it's been proven time and time again. The debate about this has been beaten to death, with threads made nearly every day trying to convince you one way or the other. I've been competitive myself and never put in more than 10$. So I can't really thumbs this up or down; I'm just going to leave it up to you as I retire. In summery Hearthstone is a decent enough card game, but it's easy to be disappointed when you look at all the wasted potential.-Drain (Steam)\"

I mean - we're talking about Blizzard - the company that butchered and ruined WoW and Diablo series just for some extra money, but maybe they changed their ways?It actually it is free, so anyone can test it.The beginnings were quite fine. Couple of battles that teach us basic mechanics, everything looks nice, gameplay is smooth. Then we get access to training battles, we get to unlock new classes (each comes with some class-specific cards), we unlock more basic cards and try to build our own decks.First few hours were really enjoyable. I was having fun, playing against AI, playing some battles vs other players. I've completed some ""tasks"" or ""quests"" and got some extra cards.Then I tried playing training vs expert AI. Turns out it means that AI just uses better cards. I was beaten several times, all those rare/epic cards make a ton of difference. Then I've tried unlocking all the basic cards for all the classes. That was a big mistake.It seems like matchmaker rather than looking at your win/loss ratio checks the level of your characters. Try unlocking all the basic cards (which means leveling all the characters till lvl 10) and suddenly you're fcked. I've done all those leveling against AI then I played 10 games versus other players.First day of playing I went 6-1. Not bad.Second day (after some leveling) I went 0-10. Yes, 10 losses. 9 of those games I've faced opponents who had max ~5 basic cards (out of 30). Better cards give MASSIVE advantage. I've even tried looking for some builds that include just basic cards, but I didn't make any difference. Last fight was quite ok: playing against a guy that only used basic cards - just like me. Close fight, going head to head for 8 rounds. Then he pops 2 legendary cards and I'm done.Long story short: I need better cards if I want to have any chance of winning vs other players.How do you get them?1. Spend $$2. Play the single player campaing - which costs $$ to unlock3. Grind gold (virtual currency) to buy extra packsYou can get gold by: winning vs other players (10 gold per 3 wins).Completing daily quests: 40-60 gold per quest. 2 quests per day.Single pack costs 100 gold. It contains 5 cards, usually 1-2 rare cards in a pack.You can't complete quests playing vs AI.I can either pay money or grind for weeks, months while getting beaten by everyone because matchmaker sucks.F*** this game.\"

The quote ""Worthy opponent"" that you get everytime you get an enemy is the biggest joke of all when going for quests like this with a hero on level 0.Matchmaking as a new player is like showing up to a gunfight with a rubberknive. While you sit on your basic cards which have nearly 0 impact on the game your ""worthy opponent"" pulles out one legendary after the other or other extremly powerful cards that need to be unlocked first and crushes you like an insect.\"

The game isThis game is simply the most heinous vile atrocity that the world has ever produced. It is run by people exploiting its absolutely rubbish mechanics in attempts to the con the user into more spending, all those u-tube videos do is manipulate kids into buying a game that hasn't cost any real development at all, and it only offers them with a lack of fair play in return. The game is redundant when most classes can kill you before you can even drop a card, because the malicious computer provides the user with a lack of cards to drop on their turn, yet mysteriously your opponent will always have the perfect card to play. It is a rock paper scissor approach and it doesn't matter your investment, because this game relies mostly on the luck that  a computer selects something for you to play on your turns. So the game adds more abilities to draw even more cards and copy duplicate cards, but taht doesn't even matter if the cards don't come up due to the luck of the draw. Some class are so imbalanced away from other classes played, that it clearly favors them with cheaper abilities too press those Iwin buttons with.. The grammar on the cards was written by people who don't speak using grammar as every card was made to be exploited away from that grammar contained on their descriptions. The game uses P2P protocols where it constantly disconnects you, and it is one of the worse game on the planet for this occurrence. The game has frequent bugs in the mechanics where players gain stuff they shouldn't have making more and more of stuff they never needed more of and the deck that supposedly only contained a max of 2 or a single legend. It is a game that you need to invest to compete playing. As in you need to psychically spend currency buying stuff and even upon purchasing you are still a victim to its poor design and its lack of fair play.A design that wants to be played as quickly as possible in as few turns as possible, why, because time is money. So it only offers 30 hp that is dead by turn 4 ,as you are only given a selection of unplayable cards prior to that turn you are dead in having nothing significant to counter your opponent even though you have filled you deck appropriately with plenty of cards on the starting turns. The design has an appalling layout, it hasn't put cards into rows to be hot keyed. It doesn't provide the user with their own strategic choice of starting selection. It doesn't allow the user to make as much game currency as they can acquire per day from playing, instead it limits them, because they won't spend. It doesn't provide the tavern tourney all week, because that often makes game currency quicker than other matched modes. It disconnects only from playing this game, in matches that you can instantly relog, but you have lost your game that there was no protection offered. It doesn't group players fairly, it groups them with players well outside their psychical level.. It forces starts for many turns  away from the mathematical odd of a coin flip 50/50 or non start for as many turns as up to 10, and it groups with the same player as many as 4 time sin a row, and the same class for many attempts  frequently again as many as 10 times. It has worse loss streaks then provided win streaks, they are not balanced, up to the point the assumption is you are grouped against robots and the computer has simply worked out a strategy to your deck.This is monkey made game was  typical pyramid scheme. It was designed to exploit the user into spending, it doesn't give a hoot about anything else, because if a million people spend buying some of this game's crap and they have too, in having the same features you are grouped against, it has made millions. It uses crap connection protocols when it runs from same servers hosting much better games that offer far superior multiplayer. It basically took the concept from a world famous epic game and churned out total garbage in attempt to exploit that fan base.Avoid this abysmal game at all costs. It is simply heinous. These games should be stopped, and its reign of corruption ended. It seems the common tactic of the industry today is screw the user into spending more on crap that is redundant. It is all across the console industry today with DC packs, it is all across the internet with these freemiums and there is nothing epic coming out of the industry apart from these exploitively redundant hacks. For the love of this planet anybody else with a hint of reasoning should absolutely avoid. These type of games are simply not worth it, do not be conned otherwise by the lies fed by those people exploiting that concept of you buying more to always get less because there is always more to buy when it is never enough. It is absolutely sickening. It might as well be that Nigerian phonejack credit card details please muhahaha.\"

This has nothing to do with playing the cards you are dealt, since if luck isn't on your side you can end up with 4 cards that need 8 crystals and the opponent will have a zerg rush waiting to kick your ass.It gets a 3 because it is a well crafted game like anything Blizzard make, but as for the gameplay mechanics it gets a big fat 0 since it isn't even a game that you can be good at, you just sit there and hope that *this* time your cards will come out in the right order and you can't actually be a GOOD Hearthstone player, just someone hedging his or her bets that the deck you've built is going to beat the odds so you don't need to be lucky to win it.Which also means if you want to be good at Hearthstone you just need to buy the cards you need to win and play a lot, since there is no actual skill involved to become a good player, just the bare basics of gameplay where you don't make really stupid decisions. Get the basic elements of play down (don't use a group damage spell when the enemy has no minions, don't be stupid.) and you will win, and the reverse of that if you have a **** deck and luck isn't on your side you will fail.I really wouldn't mind any of the luck element if the skill element could make up for bad luck, but it doesn't. You can be a brilliant strategist but you will lose against a lucky retard rolling his face across the keys and summoning a murloc zerg while you hold 2 core hounds you can't use for 3 turns.

2014,HearthStone,"Hearthstone is an usual card based game with a simple yet ingenuine twist - it's marketing strategy. The cards in Hearthstone are as in any Blizzard game could be of common, rare, epic and legendary quality.

Game currency could be obtained via daily quests - 40/60 gold + 30 wins wouldHearthstone is an usual card based game with a simple yet ingenuine twist - it's marketing strategy. The cards in Hearthstone are as in any Blizzard game could be of common, rare, epic and legendary quality. Cards could be obtained through buying card packs - for game currency (100 gold ) or real currency. Game currency could be obtained via daily quests - 40/60 gold + 30 wins would provide additional 100 gold ( first 1000 gold could be earned through onetime ""achievements"" ). Which means around of 1 pack per day or via fight on arena which provide you with 2 packs per day at least for additional 12 games. Which translates into 2-4 hours of play everyday.  On average one in five packs would be epic card and one in 20 packs would be random legendary card. However, since many cards are belongs to specific class a chance of obtaining specific card is very low so deck's building strategy revolves around random cards or you could transform cards into ""Arcane dust"" at very low conversion rate e.g. one specific common card costs 40 points while result of conversion of common card is only 5 points, one pack in average converted to 40 points, in order to buy specific rare card required 100 points, in order to buy specific epic card you would need 400 points e.g. 10 packs while  legendary card is equal to 160 packs.  So in order to built some average deck you would need to spend about 160 hours of game's play during 40 days or pay to Blizzard about 200$.  Now would you be willing to participate in tournament where are fundamental advantage could be bought via real money ?Gameplay itself isn't bad except couple of severe bugs for Mac client which probably already fixed, the expansion Naxxramas isn't bad either, although all 5 wings on Normal mode could be eliminated in a couple of hours , however cards from Naxxramas quite useful so expansion is also part of marketing strategy , in terms of money it's a really good deal since it's provides specific valuable cards for a low price. The game is theme is all about World of Warcraft universe and some cards provides nostalgic value to fan's of ""wrath of the lich king"" expansion. If you are looking for a long term time investment and rewarding competitive gaming you will find this game as a huge disappointment. Surely as any card game results of every match could be quite random so if you are lover of carefully crafted strategies and well deserved rewards you should stay away  from  this game as well.\"

Most of the long-term players share such sentiments. They log on, farm their quests, play a few games, get infuriated and log off. It all sounds so counter-intuitive. As you new player, all you longed for was a competitive collection. But it takes years or hundreds of dollars to gain such. As a veteran, you grow more weary of the game every day and remain in perpetual hope that the next DLC will change something but it never does. There is only torment and despair to be found hereHearthstone is an addiction not a game. Save yourself the trouble of being shackled to this game and look elsewhere.\"

One thing's for sure: it was printing money for Japs faster than our Federal Reserve ever could.HoW didn't learn (correction: didn't care) from past mistakes (correction: good marketing). All the starting cards suck, and viability is fortified by a paywall the size of a skyscraper.

Shiny, flashy, pretty, soothing sound track, great voices, beautiful art, and Warcraft's charming humor often makes its way in (ie dropping the Raid Leader card and he shouts 'HANDLE IT!'). Critics have compared it to a glorified slot machine, and I couldn't say it better myself.It's laughable that people can take this competitively in any way. A game that has the word ""random"" twice or more isn't competitive. Let's see how HoW plays out:The game begins. You are RANDOMLY selected a few cards from your deck. You can choose which ones stay, or to RANDOMLY switch it out for another. You then draw a RANDOM card. Your opponent draws a RANDOM card. You place a card that RANDOMLY attacks friend/foe. They play a card that RANDOMLY kills everything on the board except for one RANDOMLY chosen card in play. They RANDOMLY draw 2 cards they combine that's ready to end the game in just 2 turns. But did you RANDOMLY get the card to counter it? No? WHAM! 1 more turn....still nope. WHAM gg. OR....you DO get the card, counter him completely and gg; YOU WIN. F* what is happening to video games??? With a pair of die and a little imagination, you can play this game for free w/o electricity!There's also single player, but it's even worse. I played against a boss that 2 shot me in the 3rd turn. I didn't even get a f*ing chance to draw 4 card and he 2 shot me 5x in a row. Who designed this SP??

2014,Middle Earth,"Ultimately, I think this game is worthy of all the praise that it has received thus far. As a full disclosure, I haven't quite finished the game, but I've finished nearly all of the story missions, and I'm cleaning up some of the side stuff, and I decided to write this while taking a break. So, bar an abysmal ending, this review should hold up.RPG MechanicsUltimately, I think this game is worthy of all the praise that it has received thus far. As a full disclosure, I haven't quite finished the game, but I've finished nearly all of the story missions, and I'm cleaning up some of the side stuff, and I decided to write this while taking a break. So, bar an abysmal ending, this review should hold up.RPG Mechanics----------------------------------------------------------------The first thing you need to know about this game is that nearly the entire focus of the game is on combat. When it comes to the actual RPG mechanics of this RPG, it's pretty light, honestly. You go about and kill things and find collectibles and etcetera to acquire EXP/currency to upgrade your abilities/weapons and there's also a rune system which are used to augment your character into some more specific roles. From my understanding, what runes you actually acquire from the Orc Captains are pretty random, but the ones I've gotten tend to rely on random chance more than anything else, just straight percentage rolls. Which is ultimately fine, as your character has another means of upgrading, via a skill tree system which actually has a good amount of variety/customisation. It's a tiered system (which makes sense) and the abilities actually impact the way you play the game rather than just provide you with a bunch of passive stuff.Combat----------------------------------------------------------------------------The actual combat in the game is very satisfying, albeit a bit easy. It takes cues from the Batman: Arkham series and just has a kind of freeflow combo system. A lot of games try to emulate this system, and a lot of games fail at this system. This game, fortunately, does the system well. The combat is very fluid and responsive and is generally very accurate. Also, the animation quality of this title is top notch, so moves flow into each other very well and your character looks completely natural while pulling off his extravagant combos. There is also a rudimentary stealth system that is functional, but very basic. You should not play this game in a stealth only approach, and if you do (if it's even possible), you are not very likely to have a lot of fun.Story-------------------------------------------------------------------------The story is pretty serviceable. It hasn't been anything that has been cringeworthy, it feels pretty in place in a Tolkien universe. I've read The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings trilogy, but I haven't read the other Middle-Earth stuff, but as far as I can tell, the game doesn't really reuse any plot devices from the books and everything feels natural. I've had a lot of fun with the own stories that end up getting created as you play the game via the Nemesis system where you form your own rivalries with orcs and orcs will fight amongst themselves and vie for power. If you get killed by an orc, that orc gets more powerful and becomes your nemesis and you get to go hunt him down for revenge. It creates context to the battles you're fighting and gives the enemies more personality. Also, the voice acting in this game is top notch.Technical things-----------------------------------------------------This game ran at a smooth 60 fps and, as far as I'm aware, didn't dip anywhere. The graphical fidelity is quite good (Full HD res even!), the texture quality was very consistent, and I didn't notice much of anything like texture pop-in, etcetera. The draw distance is quite far as well. In my playthrough, I did not notice any bugs or glitches. Once in a while there was some odd collision detection with the environment as you go for a stealth kill but outside of that, nothing.Conclusion--------------------------------------The game is fun, pure and simple. The Nemesis system is pretty innovative as it allows you to play games in the shadows where you pit orcs against each other. I wanted to talk more about that, but it's kind of hard to put into text, you might want to watch a video that'll give you more detail on that. I recommend TotalBiscuit's video on YouTube.I gave this game a 9 because later on in the game, things do start to feel a bit repetitive. Unfortunately, I think that is just something that's inherent to the combat system and the game is very combat focused. Do not buy this game if you do not like the Arkham style combat system. Also, the game won't really present you with much of a challenge, which disappointed me a bit. One other gripe with this game is that there are a couple forced stealth sections, they are few in number but it's, y'know, a slap in the face to player choice and agency.When all is said and done though, I quite enjoy this game. It feels in place with Tolkien works and the combat mechanics are responsive, fluid, and fun while adding a bit of innovation to the genre via the Nemesis system. Also, the production values are top notch, truly an AAA title.Monolith is back to form.\"

It's an open world most of the time, so the enemies just have super small sight. You can kill 3 enemies stealthly when they are all side by side and nobody notices. It's made to look like you are stealth, but in fact I think they found out that in LoTR orcs are deaf and have very poor vision. Also, there is no ""go behind the wall mechanics"", so when you go close to a wall, the camera focus on the wall and the controller gets clumsy (since you can't walk by the wall).Combat mechanics are a bit better, but still clumsy. Fighting has lots of button smashing and the player moves in random directions sometimes. To compensate for the easiness of button smashing, the game throws tons of monsters at you at the same time. This changes the mechanic into: button smashing, run far from everyone (which you do faster than them anyway), wait for them to come in line, button smashing and repeat. Also, the bow mechanic is worse than Tomb Raider. The only ok point of the combat system is that you don't have to actually switch weapons (press square you use the sword, press R2/L2 you use the bow).The open world part seems to be ok so far and the nemesis/famous orcs part works well. The respawn system is very aggressive (more than Destiny, for example). It means it is virtually impossible to get rid of all orcs in an area before killing the big guys. You kill a bunch of them, walk 15 steps, look back and there are more of them again. The only way to clear an area is killing the bug guys. It is designed like this because the fighting is very easy 1vs1.\"

The characters aren't top-notch realistic, yet the graphics, animation look great, especially in 1080p.  The combat is more like Batman than like AC, although it does borrow AC's scaling walls as well as the rooftop strikes, but you level up your combat combos and skills like the Batman Arkham games.  But, this game goes beyond what Batman offers in the combat scheme as the addition of ""Wraith"" skills makes combat something incredible to see once you get all the nuances down.  The ""nemesis"" system is an awesome innovation that I would love to see more open world games utilize.  I found myself getting caught up more in cleaning out orc strongholds and bending a makeshift army to my will, then searching out the story line in this open world. Sadly, while there is an emotional charged story, with both Tailon and Celebrimbor as your duel protagonists, it never really comes across compelling enough to get caught up in.  Such as shame, because the voice acting and animations are very well done.  And the last sad thing about this game is the final end battles with Sauron's servants that were very anti-climatically done.  Think Tomb Raiders last game disappointing boss battle.  But even with those issues,  I found myself engrossed in the world of Mordor and quite a willing participant to rid Middle Earth of orcs in flourishing style.\"

The story was also really good as well, although at times it felt a bit thrown together (you can approach certain missions in whatever order you want, so branching side-stories can feel lost in the overall narrative). My only major gripe is that after the campaign is finished the side missions (archer, sword, dagger and outcast missions) dont have enough variety to sustain 5-10hrs of grinding.

SoM has an awesome setting, the best integration between movie scenes and in game content I have ever seen and a vast beautiful open world to explore finding some random stuff to do the same way you could find it in Red Dead Redemption but with a strong influence from Batman Arkham series and Assassin's Creed series. I don't like Lord of the Rings lore... I even hated it, but if you like epic games and Orcs (specially killing them) you won't be able to stop playing this. Also there are lots of collectibles and additions to complete. One of the most interesting things is also the way Sauron's army has its own living hierarchy. For an instance, if you die at the hands of an Orc boss, he will be rewarded with a higher Rank and you will see this in a screen that shows the current army's status, but also other Orcs can kill between them or the recently upgraded ones, taking their ranks. These things make them more powerfull, and is fun to find one who killed you in past again, and get revenge when he is suposed to be more powerfull and brags about thart fact. Also, there are many different ways to kill your enemies or create distractions... to mention one, you can just stay at distance and shot arows to free jailed beasts, and watch how they eat them all... or also runaway to avoid been eaten too! Brilliant!\"
2014,Middle Earth,"Taking into consideration some of the other major reviews, for example ""IGN"" and ""GameSpot"", I have to agree that the campaign, even though it is interesting to experience since it involves more of the lore of ""Middle Earth"", it is not the game's strongest factor/component. That does not necessarily mean that it disappoints, but that it leaves you wanting more. You get this feeling thatTaking into consideration some of the other major reviews, for example ""IGN"" and ""GameSpot"", I have to agree that the campaign, even though it is interesting to experience since it involves more of the lore of ""Middle Earth"", it is not the game's strongest factor/component. That does not necessarily mean that it disappoints, but that it leaves you wanting more. You get this feeling that the main story messes up what you already know from either the books or the movies (most common). My personal ""Story"" score would be a 7 or 8 out of 10. Of course, this game received good critic from major reviewers for a reason, and that reason is everything else excluding the ""Main Story"" of the game. This includes the fantastic gameplay with your epic sword, your ghostly bow, and finally your brutal stealthy dagger. Even more fun are the abilities that you have from being a ""Wraith"" where you are tremendously fast and blow you opponents heads off continuously. It is extremely fluid and responsive in every situation. There is nothing else to say about the gameplay since it is difficult to understand just from a review how impeccable it really is. This game was created, in my opinion, to introduce the ""Nemesis System"". Even though it is really easy to understand what it is doing while playing the game, I will just say this: Every kill you make, counts. Every kill your opponents make, especially counts! You could be fighting some random ""Uruk"" while exploring Mordor, and something happens and leads to your death. The random (could had avoided death) Uruk that killed you will now become a ""Captain"" and all the other ""Captains"" will increase there level. The thing is that if you are not careful while playing, and are constantly dying, the ""Captains"" can become a huge issue, getting into a point where they are totally harder than a ""War-chief"" (Commander of Captains). You might not understand what this means (not until you get the game), but basically keep in mind that you receive rewards to upgrade Talion , but think of his deaths as a ""Double-Punishment Treat"". You can always be able to kill even the hardest opponent, but don't expect it to be as easy as you might think since at that point, they will be invulnerable to simply everything.To conclude my simple review for ""Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor"", I say that it always falls down to you (reader of my review) whether or not to buy the game, maybe you're not into games like this, or maybe this game has made things difficult for in terms of how the game it-self is made up. I will have to admit though that when I bought the game I was not entirely sure I made the right choice for giving away $60, but after while, I realized that the game is unique in it's own, specific way and has come out to bring a different sense/feeling of gameplay compared to anything else out there in the market. It has come out to intrigue ""Gamers"", who are looking for something different in terms of game development.\"

It's smooth and beautiful and a great step up on the next gen consoles. The nemesis system is incredible, within 2 hours I had been killed 6 times by one foolish uruk who made his way up the ranks, eventually I got revenge, only for him to come back with a face wound and for our battle to continue. It creates small stories and power struggles within the game and I absolutely love it. Overall Shadow of Mordor is an incredibly fun experience, though it is not without flaw and so much more could be done with it, I would highly recommend it. I look forward to more games following in the footsteps of this one\"

The universe could be more developed too with a bigger map with more locations and also more diversity in the enemies and allies, but it's still a pleasant world to play in.The side activities are a little repetitive too, but the Army system is a true marvel and will provide infinite content, it took me 30 hours to finish the game with approximately 10 of them spend only to slaying captains (in other words expect 20 hours to finish the game at 100 percent).But the game shines thanks to its gameplay, clearly inspired by Assassin's Creed and Batman Arkham series it also adds its own touch with the Wraith that gives you unique abilities like mounting wild beasts, controlling enemies or the nemesis system. I enjoyed every bit of the game.With Shadow of Mordor it seems Warner finally found the right formula to make great Lord of The Rings games, they still have to build on it, particularly increase the diversity in the game and not the same generics characters and story.\"

You can sometimes use stealth to thin the odds, but that's only for some missions; in the open world, it felt like most of the time you'd race to kill the boss before more linked.There were more issues, but the game felt grindy and unfun. The cool little Gollum missions and moments like riding a catagor seemed few and far between, as opposed to walking from point a to point B trying to kill an endless supply of respawning orcs who taunt you if they kill you. And those boss orcs are either randomly easy (die to a single headshot, can be stealth killed) or resist everything (can't be stunned, can't be flipped over, invulnerable to ranged attacks...) It's a gorgeous game, but not one I can play in long spurts without getting annoyed at.\"
2014,Middle Earth,"Nemesis system is great, the graphics are nice, they do not bother at all, tasks, war is fun, but the scenario is boring. The game does not have a decent boss battle. Especially the last boss is a complete disgrace."

I love the LOTR lore, and this did nothing but interest me. I was not yelling at how it may contradict the lore, I was interested at how this provides a different take. I will leave it at that to avoid spoilers. The story is not in your face, but carefully in the background, allowing you to explore your two main characters while progressing further. The true fun is in the nemesis system.Gameplay: This game plays just like the Batman Arkham games, with a smooth free-flow combat system based around achieving combos and using various abilities. However, the nemesis system adds a whole new dimension to this game. Each uruk is unique--even the lowly grunts. Each one has the potential to rise and fall (die) in the ranks, develop new traits (weaknesses, strengths, etc.) based on their experiences, and also be your tool of manipulation. The real fun is choosing uruks that you enjoy and dominating them--this allows you to begin building your own line of uruks, having them train and gain power, get close to your target, or strike at other uruk leaders. If you like the combat of the Batman Arkham games, you will enjoy this combat, which includes the excellent gore and crude violence missing from Batman, as well as some great differences to make it its own.Graphics: While I felt like the main character (Talion) had a weird appearance to his face, you are usually over his shoulder so it is not often in view. Everything else looks fantastic. Not quite up to the current-gen standard, but clearly at the cross-gen peak.This game is a whole lot of fun. While the story may be short, the nemesis system offers endless hours of coming back and manipulating the ranks of your enemies.P.S. Some of these orcs will freak your out!

Just to continue playing against war cheifs and captains? That is fun and all but the final point is so that my character would be strong enough to face the final boss. I mean that's the point right?

While some people think it's a rip off or boring, I would say that it takes inspiration from other games and makes it their own. The nemesis system is incredible while being super frustrating and rewarding. I remember going back to specific warchiefs and captains AFTER I've beaten the game to test myself.Having said all this, the story is interesting and works well within the LoTR universe. The graphics are fantastic and I only imagine they look even better on PC (sorry, PS4 fans...it's true). The combat speaks for itself with it being very fluid while sometimes button-mashy, but fun in its own right. There's a lot of ways to make your character OP, but if one were to completely dismiss the strategy of runes, stealth, attacking enemies' weaknesses, you're going to be in for a frustrating time. That's the one thing I do enjoy about this game. With Batman or Assassin's Creed, if you were powerful enough, you could just go all ""guns-blazing"" and make it out alive. With ""Shadow of Mordor"", you have to use some strategy and some wits, otherwise, you'll be dead before you know it. For that reason, this game gets a 9.I'm looking forward to more games within this series. A great new series from Monolith.\"
2014,Middle Earth,"Shadow of Mordor is a hybrid between a sandbox and Arkham-style brawler that is set in the famous land of Mordor, in which you play as Talion, a ranger from the black gate who is brought back from the dead, after having his family slaughtered in front of him, by a wraith who had forgotten his past (I would just outright say who he is but I don't want to spoil, even if it is completelyShadow of Mordor is a hybrid between a sandbox and Arkham-style brawler that is set in the famous land of Mordor, in which you play as Talion, a ranger from the black gate who is brought back from the dead, after having his family slaughtered in front of him, by a wraith who had forgotten his past (I would just outright say who he is but I don't want to spoil, even if it is completely obvious who he is).I think I speak for many of us, Tolkein fans and traitors alike, when I say that expectations for Shadow Of Mordor were rather low, it both being a movie/book tie in game and a Lord Of The Rings game, which (unless you count that one RTS game which I thought was kind of good) are both historically **** or at least not really that good, largely due to heavy pandering to the fans by focusing exclusively on accuracy and completely forgetting that video games are supposed to be fun. Either that or the other way round where the devs don't give a rat's arse for the fans, or humanity in general, and end up creating an abomination which even the flaming pits of hell wouldn't admit to creating.However Shadows miraculously avoids this and manages to both be a fun game while at the same time expanding on the franchise, though it is non-canon so I suppose it matters little regardless.While we're on the topic of fun, my oh my is Shadows fun, it manages to blend elements from Assassin's Creed and Arkham games rather effectively while at the same time adding in some fresh ideas of it's own. The best singular example of this would be the much lorded Nemesis system, which allows you to look into and target the more powerful Orcs within the Orc hierarchy itself and once intel is gathered, learning their weaknesses and strengths so as to make the task of murder much more successful and that's only the beginning, it gets even better when you insert your own mind-controlled orcs into the mix later on in the game.Also when it comes to murder, SOM gets a big fat check from me, as the combat and the enemies are both fun, intuitive and interesting, I especially like both the fantastic voice-acting and the way that the head orcs (to put it simply) recognise and talk to you, for example if you made them flee last fight you had with them, then they will reference that when they talk to you, which adds a much more personal feel to the Uruk, who by the way are all randomly generated, so everyone will have their own War-chiefs to square off against.So let's talk about environments, the land of Mordor is quite ""next-gen"" on the PS4 as it looks pretty despite being so desolate, also for those worrying that Mordor will be another generic dark bland sandbox needn't worry as there is also another, more lush part of Mordor to explore, so despite the sandboxes being kind of pokey when we compare them with other games, they still are interesting and have plenty to explore within them.So all in all a solid game, which though is hardly revolutionary manages to be fun and even at times half-way intelligent with it's interesting characters, that in it's whole, I cannot complain too much about, though if you don't like killing orcs and doing little much else, avoid it like the plague, otherwise I recommend this to everyone. (Unless you're a **** killjoy who can't handle one minor inaccuracy within the mythology, in which case what are you doing here? There's a new hobbit movie to complain about)\"

It gives you a bit more leeway for errors though (thankfully in this split second moments) and with the upgrade system get's some nice extra's. The stealth gameplay reminds me of Assassin's Creed games with a lot of the same movements. The stealth missions aren't too long thankfully. Orcs seems to be fairly blind though, allthough this allows for a better gameplay experience overall with more freedom  of movement.Graphics: Not much to note here if I'm honest. It looks great (depending on your rig). Pushes the bar just a little bit higher and still runs well while doing so. Make sure you get the HD package after installing.Replayability: That's where the downside of this game kicks in. It felt short. I completed the entirity of this game (side missions, collectibles, weapon legends, etc.) in 21 hours. For a modern third person action game that's a respectable time. Still it felt way too short for me and the main storyline consists of 20 missions which only tell a threadbare story. The entire time I was playing I felt like I was playing in an enclosed enviroment. Just a teeny, tiny bit of what could be a huge world. Some of the final missions were just to wrap up the story line and felt like the designers didn't know where they could go anymore. And a quick-time event for the final scene just seems like a waste to me.Conclusion: An overall very good game which is certainly worth buying if you're into fast paced action in a good looking world. You might at times feel claustrophobic within the confined walls of the two zones, but there's plenty to do in this secluded space of MIddle-Earth. If the above is not true for you than I'd suggest waiting till the price drops to 25 euro's/dollars or so before picking this up. As far as the storyline goes you're not missing anything by not buying this title.\"

The gameplay is excellent and although elements have been taken from Assassins Creed and Batman Shadow of Mordor  uses all these ability's with a fresh approach. The combat system is excellent and there is nothing more rewarding than decapitating an orc and watching his fellow soldiers running to the hills in shock and dismay.. A mention has to go to the Nemesis system which a totally new experience and is constantly in the back ground. You take down a captain then another orc is promoted they may get to war chief only to be beheaded in the future. The graphics are vibrant and detailed and always a joy to look at.

The camera might sometimes be a little off but never to an annoying point or that it hampers your view or fighting ability.And even though anything but the main missions is repetitive (kill uruks, free slaves, kill warchiefs) there is a certain addiction to doing the challenges, duels and interrupting a recruitment attempt by Uruk warchiefs. Especially when things get personal (they have killed you and brag about it, throw insults at you or run away to fight you another time) it is very satisfying to walk across half of Mordor to get that bastard and finish him off. The sheer hatred you feel when a cowardly warchief stabs you every time in the back when you are already in a fight and kills you for the 3th time that way (all the while growing in power) I have not experienced before.The abilities work all very well and give you more options to make a battle a whole spectacle.I just had hoped there would be a bit more diversity in your enemies/world, like Haradrim or Easterlings. Maybe that will be something for expansions? And my worry is that when you are fully levelled up you become a bit to godlike which takes away the thrill of the fight or hunt.My only complaint is that not everything is explained very well. You learn the most from doing immediately the main missions but somehow they throw you out there in the open world without much explaining.\"

2014,Middle Earth,"Shadow of Mordor could be epic, and most of the time feels like its heading in that direction, but then....just isn't. The game does a lot of things right, and a lot of things that other games don't do. To judge a book by its cover Shadow of Mordor looks great, and once you dive in it is great. However, the game is held back later on by a lack of impact and replayability.Shadow ofShadow of Mordor could be epic, and most of the time feels like its heading in that direction, but then....just isn't.

However, the game is held back later on by a lack of impact and replayability.Shadow of Mordor looks great. I wasn't blown away by the technical prowess of the graphics, but everything looks sharp. The character models are well done, combat animations are fun to watch and the world looks, for the most part, realistic. The blood and guts gore adds to the oppressive tones of the title, though does go a bit far. Its only the second time my wife has asked me not to play a game in front of her (the other being the original The Darkness). There are plenty of games out there I wouldn't play in front of children, but there are far fewer I wouldn't feel comfortable playing with other adults around, and this one crosses that line at times. The gore isn't sadistic nor necessarily over the top, but it is frequent and bloody. The voice acting and sound are solid and add to the experience. There were no characters or enemies that sounded out of place or had poor acting, and the main cast was solid from start to finish. Overall, a solid start to finish presentation that won't blow you away, unless you love seeing gore, but has a high floor that doesn't disappoint.The gameplay is where the game shines. The combat is fun, fluid and gets better as you level up so it doesn't stagnate. I would compare the gameplay favorably to the Batman Arkham series (which I enjoy) but my friends equate it to the Assassin's Creed games (which they enjoy). As you level you gain a sense of power slowly but surely. Where a few weak enemies early in the game would quickly kill you, by the end of the game you are able to easily dispatch even the most powerful enemies you come across. The world is easy to navigate and rarely becomes frustrating, save for the times you want to just get a certain collectible but have to cut through a horde of enemies to collect it. The stealth is fun, if a bit clunky. Once you figure the system out it becomes simple to stealth through areas sniping enemies with the bow, but there's always that sense of suspense as a horde of enemies can come crashing down if you make a wrong move. The minigames are varied and fun, ranging from stealth assassinations to last stand type situations with your bow to freeing prisoners through whatever means are available. They can become frustrating later on in the game as there are no checkpoints, so if you fail you have to start over. This can be even worse for the stealth minigames as you can make a mistake so easily.This may be a small spoiler, but to anyone who has watched a trailer for the game you will know the end goal of the game is army building. To take over Sauron's army by controlling their minds and turning them against him. This was what made me want to play the game so badly. Be able to build an army and take it into combat. It's extremely fun and rewarding to find the captains you want and take control of them. You are then able to assist them on the missions they undertake, much like you are able to hinder enemy captains as they undertake missions. The problem is it doesn't really do you a lot of good. Yes, it's fun to get into a brawl and have an ally captain come with his small group of soldiers to aid you, but the problem is that it's not really all that useful. Captains will be where they are and you can't command them anywhere else. And the commands you can give them are very limited and don't allow for a lot of strategy beyond trying to position captains you control to become a warchief. Once they are warchiefs they become slightly more useful, but only as a means to kill off enemy captains. The one really annoying hiccup I did run into with the system was if you control enough captains the game feels hollow, as there aren't anything besides basic enemies to fight and not a lot to do with the captains you do control. Army building is extremely fun and rewarding until you realize that it's not really all that useful in the grand scheme of the game, though by that point you'll be powerful enough to rip through any enemy that comes across you. You have an army, which is fun, but it's an army that just wanders around.Shadow of Mordor is fun, rewarding and does a lot of things right. The floor is high as everything is done well. Unfortunately there are enough issues to keep the game from being epic. I would equate Shadow of Mordor to a book that draws you in, makes you want to keep going, makes you invested in the characters and then just....kind of peters out. The game is spent doing a lot of fun things, that make you invested in what's going on, only to surprise by just kind of ending without great resolution or impact.\"
2014,Middle Earth,"A very strong and engaging experience, mostly.The story is a tad weak in driving the game, however, things like the Nemesis system constantly push the world forward.  Yes, the world could be a little bit bigger, but the designers did a great job of balancing the size with the large amount of enemies all over the map.Randomly running into an officer was also an exciting experience.A very strong and engaging experience, mostly.The story is a tad weak in driving the game, however, things like the Nemesis system constantly push the world forward.  Yes, the world could be a little bit bigger, but the designers did a great job of balancing the size with the large amount of enemies all over the map.Randomly running into an officer was also an exciting experience.  Once, while I was fighting one (in order to gain intel about the warchief) I was met by 4 others.  Suddenly, a small battle turned into a large one with 5 officers and about 30 other orcs.  The game is full of exciting moments like that.The leveling system and customization also perfectly match the length of the campaign and size of the world.  At no point did I feel like I leveled too quickly or not enough.A feature that would have been nice is a difficulty setting.  I found that when I beat the game, even though I thoroughly enjoyed it, I had no urge to go back again.  If I could set it on a harder difficulty, I definitely would have given it another go.My biggest issue, besides the weak story, is the final battle of the game.  It is essentially a 30second QT event, which really rubbed me the wrong way.  They had created such a great and exciting experience up until those final moments.All in all, I think this one is definitely worth your money and time.  If your looking for an RPG action fix this is it.  Oh yeah, and the added bonus is that is J.R.R Tolkien.\"
2014,Middle Earth,"Assassins Creed meet Shadow of Mordor. The stealth is not as good as AC. The story is really non existent, however the open world is amazing and there is tons of challenges to complete as well as tons of collectibles to find. Overall, Mordor is a good game and the good out ways the bad for sure."
2014,Middle Earth,"Fantastic game, thoroughly enjoyed from start to finish, There are a few tweaks the developers could have made, for instance the ending / final battles were very disappointing.Hopefully this is a start to a successful chain of games, each improving like the Assassins Creed games"
2014,Middle Earth,"First, I'm gonna discuss all the things the game does right. #1 Presentation. No other LOTR game has come close to capturing the grandness that is Middle-Earth. SoM does so perfectly. It's extremely detailed from top to bottom. Although the graphics aren't the best in terms of next-gen, the art direction surely makes up for it. There are also tons of collectibles that have their own back story which you can read (and/or listen to) in the lore menu which is pretty cool #2 Voice acting. Troy Baker gives a great performance as Talion. He gives Talion a bad-ass vibe while at the same time, is able to draw  sympathy from players. My personal favorite performances are Alastair Duncan as The Wraith or Calabrimbor, Phil Lamarr as Ratbag and Liam O'Brien as Gollum. #3 Combat. Combat here is excellent. It's basically a carbon copy of the combat from Rocksteady Arhkham series only 10x more violent which is definitely not a bad thing. You have one button to strike, one to counter, one to dodge and one to stun. The more you strike enemies, the more you fill up your combo meter and once the meter reaches a certain level, you can unleash a brutal combat finisher to change the flow of battle. The stronger Talion becomes, the more combos you can unlock by completing various story missions or side quests. The stealth is a little clunky but it's sufficient enough for players to use it from time to time and you may need to use it early on because it gets rather challenging if you're fighting dozens or orcs at the same time. Finally #5 the Nemesis System. This is a unique system which I found myself being addicted to. The Nemesis system is basically a hierarchy of  Sauron's army of infinite orcs. This is what separates SoM from other open-world action games. When an orc captain kills you, he instantly gets promoted and becomes stronger. This will also happen if even a no name/ no ranking orc kills you, that orc will INSTANTLY become a captain with his own gang. Each captain has his own list of strengths and weaknesses and if they have more of the former and less of the latter, you're gonna have a tough time especially with captains who are virtually invincible to all of your attacks. This gives substantial meaning to your deaths and you always feel like you're getting more experience even in death. But it's not all kill or be killed. As you progress, you unlock more things to with orcs if you defeat them. For example, I ""branded"" one orc captain and commanded him to become a bodyguard for a warchief. After I confronted the warchief, I commanded that captain to betray him and literally stab him in the back. This didn't bode well for the warchief because as it turned out one of his weaknesses was ""fear of betrayal"" which gave the upper hand. Not only that but events can still happen with or without your presence. Like say two captains fight each other for a spot as Elite Captain or one captain plans an ambush against another to take his place. This can all without your character ever being there. It's things like these that make SoM feel more dynamic and alive and I hope that this Nemesis System can be applied for future open-world action titles.Now that all the good is out of the way, let's get to the bad. #1 The Story and (most of) the Characters. The story is short. Too short which is very ironic seeing as this is a game based on the LoTR franchise and we all know that the franchise is known for its lengthy stories and even lengthy subplots. Without doing side quests. You can finish the main story in about 5-6 hours and it's also a bummer that most of these main story missions feel like side quests because they're so similarly structured. Also, Talion is not a very engaging protagonist. I see the writers were going for a more tragic Aragorn-ish like hero but it just doesn't work out. Calabrimbor is probably the most interesting character in the entire game and rightfully so since he is the creator of the Rings. Other than him, 2 characters stick out in my mind, Gollum and Ratbag. We all know who is Gollum is by this point and he still steals the show whenever he appears so that's great but the real surprise character is Ratbag the Coward. He's an orc that decides to help you as long as you help him climb the ranks. A ""scratch my back and I'll scratch yours"" kind of thing. He's just so funny. From his dialogue to his mannerisms, he makes an impact whenever he shows up in the missions. It's a shame that he was so unceremoniously and abruptly killed. Everyone else feels bland. Nobody else is really fleshed out. I don't even remember their names anymore. That's how forgettable the other characters were. #2 Boss Battles. They were so anticlimactic. The final 2 important battles were so disappointing. You kill them with QUICK TIME EVENTS. THEY WERE SO BORING.Overall, I liked Shadow of Mordor. It has its issues but I can't deny how addicting the combat and the unique Nemesis System is. Definitely the best LoTR game so far.\"
2014,Middle Earth,"I was hesitant about buying this game, but it turned out to be really good.

The nemesis system adds a new dynamic to the game, and punishes players who go in to kill war chiefs or captains without gathering Intel to learn said captain/war cheifs strengths and weaknesses before hand. It was also a lot of fun to play the political game of turning orcs against each other so they are aligned to you and then plotting the demise of a war chief. The fun part about that is you can convert all of a war chiefs captains to your side and then challenge the war chief. The look on his face when he walks in to take you on, feeling good about himself because he has 4 captains with him but then realizes they are going to kill him. Priceless.In the open world, I like how the orcs are just going about their business rather than being placed their just to take you on.Story wasn't too bad and had some good moving moments, but don't expect a deep story from this gameThere are few minor design issues; free running seems clunky in a few places. The end game is really easy once you have your abilities unlocked, and while that made for some fun killing, it kept me away from playing the game once I finished it (everything just became to easy). Once I was done with the main quest, I went back to kill some orc captains who killed me earlier in the game when I had no idea of what I was doing and who became very powerful as a result. Be sure to take the giant gruag for a destructive spin around mordor before your done with this game.\"

Yes please, more please. I had a great time with the game.The combat and gameplay mechanics are very fluid and clean. You definitely feel very powerful as you progress through the game, and the fighting sequences are a ton of fun.The Assassin's Creed-feel to the game comes in the way the map is set up with several collectible-esque things to find, as well as the towers revealing the map. I thought they did it in good taste though with the collectibles needing a little mini challenge to be completed to get some of them, which was always fun.Attacking the orc generals was a very cool part of the game. I found myself posting up high and watching the orc camps for as long time planning out my attack. The weaknesses and strengths added just enough to make the need for some strategy necessary, which I liked.I did however find the orc mind control a little disappointing. The game advertised orcs that would always remember you and that you could mind control and shoot up the hierarchy so you could control an army of orcs. This mechanic wasn't even available until later in the game, and wasn't quite as in depth as I thought going into it, but this is really my only issue with the game.In closing, the LOTR fan will love this game, and any fans of the Assassin's Creed or Batman series' could definitely get into it. The game offers a lot in story and amazing gameplay. Definitely a recommended game.8.9/10\"

Let\s face it, the game is easy, and it is quite easy to just say I\ll go around just swinging my sword and it\ll be fine that\ll do. However, there are quite a decent number of different skills and different ways of killing the war chiefs (e.g. direct approach, poisoning grog, taking advantage of a mutiny or what scares them, possession etc.).  So, yes you can make this game really simple and repetitive if you want and go CBA, but it is potentially varied in the ways you can approach your enemies and if you take advantage of that you\ll have a lot more fun.

2014,Middle Earth,This game is one of my favorites. I love the open world part of it that lets you do almost whatever you want. My only problem with it is there weren't enough story missions.

The story overall is a bit cliche but interesting main characters as well as supporting characters and cameo appearances saves it. esp. Celembrimbor which is the most interesting character in the game. A score of 7/10.Gameplay - The gameplay is a mix of Arkham series (fighting) and the assasin's creed series (platforming and exploration), despite it lacking creativity, it is still executed properly and without major or significant problems. But the strength of the game doesnt really revolves on those but to its nemesis system, an advanced gameplay mechanic in which you control using wraith powers the Uruk officers in game and use them to wreck havoc against their fellow Uruks. Such an amazing feat added in game and is the main reason why the game is really good. The only and biggest weakness i have for this game also is in this aspect, which is the very bad boss fight...I wont spoil it to you, but all boss fights in game are bad and unremarkable in that regard. Still though, Ill give it a great score of 9/10 due to that unique nemesis system.Graphics - This game is also one of those which was released both in the last and current gen consoles and is also in my opinion looks significantly better in the current consoles. The environments are good like the dead world of the first map and the greenish and more alive world on the second map, with regards to the design and layout, the overall map is small and can be easily covered. Its not a minus though. As to the character design, overall, i really liked it. From Talion's rugged image to Celembrimbor's ghostly image is really great designs in game, The Uruks also are nice since even though some are reused models, they are still distinguishable due to different armor designs. The thing i really liked though is how their image change if you have hurt of burned them too. A score of 9/10.Sound and music - I liked the voice acting of the characters and the enemies in game, it is smooth, spot on and really gives life to the character they try to portray. As to the music however, i never really remembered anything nor did i hear anything good. A score of 7/10Overall = 8.00This is one of the underdog games of 2014 that surprised everyone and is the runner up for the most GOTYs of that year and it is really deserving of the credit and rewards it has recieved. This game showed that it is not bad to get ideas from other games so long as you can execute it smoothly and for being creative in making such a good gameplay mehanic with its nemesis system and also the advanced ai the enemies have. The Boss battles needs a lot of improvement and i hope they would do that in the sequel. It is awesome. Thanks!\"

I am not a big fan of Assassin Creed games but I do really enjoy the combat.  I feel like the combat in SoM resembles that of Assassins Creed III.  It has a parry and dodge system and it really works fluidly against multiple and hordes of enemies.  It does have a story but I am only 6 hours into the game and I have found a lot of story through the descriptions of items and memories they contain.  I also have not explored every area yet but from what I am seeing, the landscape and weather change is very nice.Gameplay - The combat has a parry & dodge system with timed button presses you can counter-attack and perform finishers.  As time goes on, you earn more types of finishing moves and special attacks.  It is amazing to be surrounded by a horde of orcs and watch all of the amazing moves you can make and gruesome finishers as you parry and flip over them.  Some of the enemies are stronger than others, especially when you get to the captains or tougher opponents and you must find other means of killing them.There is a nemesis system in place that really makes this game unique.  Each captain you face on the battlefield can and will remember you and the fight you had if they end up fleeing successfully or they are able to kill you.  If you come across them at another time, they will be stronger with better gear and will say something about your previous fight, or what you managed to do to them.Sound - The music is very fitting and at times dark and ominous.  It can really immerse you in the world if you let it.  The sounds of swords clashing and orcs grunting as you are in battle seem very authentic.Graphics - It isn't visually stunning but it still looks impressive.  There are times when the sun sets over the hills and rays of sunlight can be seen through trees and the like.  Little moments like that are nice to look at but I wouldn't purchase this game for the graphics alone.If you are a Lord of the Rings fan, this is a must buy.  If you haven't seen the movies or read the books, I would hold off until it goes on sale or possibly rent it.  I give this a 9 because of the combat and nemesis system that is in place, AND because I am a fan of the series.\"

Scenario is uninspiring and incredible repetitive.I mean, I played this one in 2015, in a moment that PS4 launch window include games like Bloodborne, Project Cars, Witcher 3 and Arkham Knight, its really hard to care about a game like this. Just a little better than mediocre.\"

I'm not a big fan of the Lord of the Rings books or movies, yet this is probably one of the most funnest games I have played in a long time.

Although repetitive controls at first, you gain a sense of accomplishment when using your newly-found skills, it's like giving your dog a treat after doing tricks. Combat in this game reminds me of the Assassin's Creed and Batman series, but with a much more eloquent display by having multiple ways of killing Orcs, not just with sword or bow. The sense of equality really brightens up the gameplay, none of your weapons will ever be overpowered, your battle is maintained purely on how you respond to each of your attackers, and the classes differ in each party so you're constantly having to focus on some Orcs first, which gives an amazing edge to the gameplay. 10/10, best game I've played.\"

This review is for you guys, and hopefully you'll read it before buying. I'm not going to bog this down with credentials. Suffice, I've played enough for long enough, and know, above most things, objectivity is key.Shadow of Mordor is not a good game. It's not the steaming pile it's made out to be by its harsher critics, no, but it's also not very good. Breaking it down piecemeal:Fighting mechanics are stolen from Assassins Creed and the Batman series, fused into a simplistic three button counter dependent system that sits just slightly below AC's variety. Fighting bottlenecks in proportion to the number of enemies, meaning the more there are, the fewer options you have and the more you must comply with the game's ideal scripted fight scenario. It's all massively flashy, but also massively repetitive. Environmental attacks are possible, but often feel very scripted, thought there are quite a few varieties. The game is heavily inclined to sneaking, which it does passably, but not well, and being spotted is a common occurrence.Weapon selection is limited to three, all of which you gain from the start. Runes can be used to improve them and give attributes, which is a good mechanic that was unfortunately shallow. Damage upgrades are earned in tailored 'proving' quests. Application of these weapons is dictated by skill tree progression. There is a sense of achievement in the skill tree, making you feel like you're gaining strength with each notch, but there is no real versatility. It is obvious what you need, and what you'll upgrade early (ranged attacks are useless, early finishers are essential). If you fail to recognize this, later engagements become terribly long suffered and some downright impossible.Overland travel is limited, stunted and slow. An early game upgrade allows short dashes to be activated by leapfrogging rocks to get you where you need to be (yes, you read that right). Talion climbs well enough, but you'll begin to notice very clear passages and footholds to starkly defined second and third floors, which lifts the veil on what you considered to be a clever entry point.Enemies are varied, and kill animations are numerous. But SOM also sadly illustrates a very good idea gone wrong in a very thoughtless way: Immunities. Some Orc captains are immune to numerous damage types. You can't sneak stab, can't use arrows for headshots, etc. The problem is, instead of improving the actual fighting mechanics or skill of these tougher orcs, the game simply adds immunities. This is a broken mechanic, and once more forces a bottleneck. In addition, when an opponent can only be killed by aerial takedown, but the nearest chest high wall is four miles away, I can't exactly invite him with a phonecall. Resistances, not immunites, would've been the step back that completely fixed this issue.The story is shamefully weak for a Tolkien inspired game. Character roster is limited to about a dozen (including NPCs, excluding the procedurally generated orcs), and though these few are well realized (never let it be said the game lacks polish on character models) their backdrops, being the environments you find yourself in, are bland and feel very samey. It is understandable that the world has been ravaged, but that's not much of an excuse for the barren nature of it. You get the feeling that you're one of the last men on earth, and not in a good heroic ascension kind of way. As a character, Talion is strong and virtuous, but also very flat. There's no progression to his grief. And grief this man has (should have) much of.Lastly, the nemesis system is essentially pokemon without visual battles, gyms or a final boss. Before you're sold on the hype and bootlicking, know that there are no benefits to 'finishing' it. It's a collect-a-thon with no payout. And with Talion's abysmal walking speed, intervening when necessary to advance your chosen orc becomes a case of racing to keep in-game appointments you're essentially setting for yourself.I didn't enjoy SOM. It could've been much more and I think a lot of the love for it stems from the want for the old days of the intense LoTR games. But it isn't those games, and for an open world, it's surprisingly devoid of content. Everything is essential to your quest in becoming the greatest orc murderer there ever was, save for one or two Gollum missions added to break up the monotony. This is a shame, because it makes the world feel very dead.I can only conclude that many reviewers here seem to have been raised on less than excellent value, game wise, to give such shining reviews. Don't get me wrong, it's okay for it to not be good, to enjoy a game for inherent elements that appeal to you. But objectivity is vital to improvement. And improvement, in the case of SOM, is a necessity if games that follow it are to rise above this\"

The nemesis system is what stands out the most in defining what makes this game unique. In that, the AI is smart in the long term but stupid in the short term. There is little variety in the game. Almost every enemy is Orc, again and again and again. I guess they can excuse the masses of dumb AI Orcs because masses of Orcs are dumb- so that was by design right? Right... And as with the gameplay so the same with the environment, it's a small open world and it all looks the same. When I think of LOTR, I think of grand beautiful variations of environments, races, and adventures. I mean I've only seen one hobbit and one elf; no wizards, dwarves, or trolls. This is just one small shadow of mordor. Still... The game is good. The challenges themselves are challenging and fun. The action is exciting. The graphical detail of Talion and each Orc is all very well done. It is similar to Arkham and AC as so may have said, which is not a bad thing. I'd also say that it's similar to Infamous as well in the layout of the map, quest & ability progression, and use of cutscenes. Music and voice acting are very good. It's got a solid dozen hours of fun. I just feel like it could/should be so much more.\"

2014,Middle Earth,"Let me start off by saying that I did not enjoy Arkham Asylum, and I hated Assassin's Creed.  I also didn't like Shadows of Mordor...at first.

In the beginning it can take quite a bit of finagling and I won't say that I didn't say some silent prayers to Cthulu and sell the soul of my first born to Satan trying to get a handle on the game.  I opted to play the tutorial again, which solved all of my problems.I am, however, a LotR enthusiast, well that's a little too far. I should say that I very much enjoyed the books, movies and games.  I found Shadows of Mordor (heretofore to be called SoM) a great deal.  I found that the stealth options were fun, the ranged options were fun, and the swingin'-my-ranger-sword-in-yo-face options were fun too.  There truly is something for each style of player, whether it be in your face, from the shadows, or a safe distance away.  Sure, the game will force you out of your comfort zone, but any great game will, in my opinion.The game is also open world, so expect that you will find it easy to meander and fart around, but it is also easy to just follow the story lines.  I enjoy that very much, because I like to roam and get far from the storyline, but I like to be able to get back to it when I want, and SoM allows you to do that.It combines innovate moves and ideas into the combat system, and rewards players for not always taking the easy way out.  The leveling system isn't too fast paced, and although I haven't beaten the game, I feel like the abilities at the end will be well worth the work, time, and effort.The game isn't without faults, I can see how some people would get bored by killing throngs of Orcs.  I am not one of those people, though.  I hunt them down like the bastards they are.I feel that the Nemesis system bears some mentioning as well, because I think this is something that I have yet to see in another game, which makes it truly original, and originality should be rewarded! (I mean, sure it may be out there in other games, but I have yet to see anything similar to the Nemesis system as of yet.)  By using the Nemesis system, WB and IE have introduced strategy into a sandbox hack-n-slash game.There is something to be said about replay-ability.  You can play this game through time and time again, and while the scenarios themselves will be the same, the way you handle them, and what you do will shape the outcome.  Literally every single time you play, you could end up changing something and finding quite a different result.PROS:Open WorldFun Combat SystemMultifaceted Combat Preference OptionsExcellent GraphicsGreat Voice ActingReplay-abilityCONS:Open WorldFeels A Bit 'Grind' OrientedSomewhat RepetitiveStoryline Needs More SubstanceOverall I give this game a 9 of 10 because of it's innovate system, excellent game play, and it's replayability. I subtracted a point because all in all, the story needs more substance, and the gameplay feels a bit grind oriented and repetitive at times.\"

While it actually has a story as compared to Destiny, and it's deeper, it's still seriously lacking considering how much material Tolkien provided in the original sources.  I get it, I'm revenging my family's death, but I just haven't don't feel compelled to disrupt the chain of command.  I have little reference for the locations.  So far, all the artifacts have told me more about the people then the history of the region, the factions, and the major players.  This might seem trite to complain about, but, when you consider how much lore is available, I feel that they should have made an effort.  The other thing that has really bothered me is the actual game play.  I don't mind so much needing to hit a button and just the right moment, but there are times where you have to move the pointer in the circle, and hit a requested button.  It's very similar to Laura Croft's 2013 release, and I hated it in that game also.  Finally, the AI can be frustrating.  I might find a captain, and I might know how best to fight it.  I can methodically take out all his unit, so it's just the two of us.  Or I could be in a battle, and one would show up.  I think, I can handle this, no problem.  I start fighting, and then, next think I know 2 or more captains show up.  I've had this happen both in and out of strongholds.  At first, I'd get killed, but then I quickly learned that sometimes, it's best to run and fight another day.  Other then my annoyances, this is a solid game, that has already given me many hours of enjoyment.  I knocked off a point for not using all the lore available, and another point for the actual game play mechanics.

That isn't a bad thing, even though WB games might get into some hot water from it legally. If you enjoy the AC series or the Batman Arkham games then Mordor will be right up your alley whether you're into the LOTR franchise or not.That's where I found myself, I like Orcs, Dwarves and Rings as much as the next guy, but fantasy has never been my favorite genre. I'd rather have light sabers and laser beams like Mass Effect or Fallout 3.Mordor does what it does well, a great quote ""If you steal from one person you're a thief, if you steal from many you're a genius."" Bruce Lee subscribed to this philosophy and apparently so does WB Montreal. It not only borrows all these facets of Batman and AC, but it IMPROVES on them.The stealth component gives you more combat options than the big Bat. There's very deft range methods that keeps expanding the gameplay for the duration. There's a huge upgradeable skill tree that will take the longest playthrough ever, or if you beat Mordor in the typical time (about 20 hours) you'll barely be able to open up some of the most impressive skills.That's all without talking about the nemesis system, which takes every underling and mini-boss from the game and turns them into a living breathing chess piece. Any grunt orc that kills you will begin moving up the Orc ladder. If any Captain or Warchief kills you his notoriety will increase, and so will his power, making him even tougher during the next encounter. Eventually you get the power to brand Orcs with your mark, eventually stock piling nearby gruns to help you take down the Chieftains. After that you quickly get the ability to brand even the warchiefs themselves and therein lies the best strategic idea behind Mordor: Do you brand the Warchief directly, or install fraudulent bodyguards that can help you remove him from his pedestal? Nearly always I found it easier to bring in my Orc trator bodyguards and do the job with me. Then ultimately the most powerful bodyguard takes the recently felled warchiefs place on the hierarchy map.So it sounds all good right? Beautiful combat backed by two great franchises WB worked on, a good solid graphics engine, new upgrades to the formula and a huge skill tree to fill out.... and you know it's coming, there's a ""but"" in here.Mordor stumbles slightly for a number of reasons, and some of it hinges on the gameplay and Nemesis ideas. There's always been flaws in ACs gameplay and while not massive some of that is still there. I will say that Tailion can grab a ladder or a ledge almost better than anyone in AC, I never felt like he did the wrong thing at the wrong time because of the game. If I blew a counter or jumped off the wrong ledge it always felt like user error, the way it should be.It seems that WB was making another game, speculation is an open world Batman game. That might very well be true, but since Arkham Knight is on the way out and is open world the rumor is it was scrapped. WB has made a very well crafted game here, and it's plenty enjoyable, it got me to trudge through blood stained Orcs and the sprawling countryside of Mordor for about 30 hours.The story is completely bare bones. Wife dies, get revenge, live with a ghots, kill Sauron, the end. There's a few cutscenes sprinkled in there, but it's pretty negligible even for LOTR fans. This game is all about the combat, and some times that's just not that exciting. The world is pretty bland with just two main areas, and strongholds of Orcs littered about. In fact, if you don't spend some hours swinging your sword killing and doing side quests you won't level up enough to have a powerful ranger. I almost completely ignored the main quests of the game for the first 20 hours and just leveled up. The main campaign is almost non stop fighting and often for no reason.Not to be too harsh, but it almost felt like a LOTR Dynasty Warriors game for the bulk of it.Finally the Nemesis system isn't as polished as it should be. I died at the hands of Orc captains or higher maybe 2 times during my entire playthrough. Mostly that's because I wasn't afraid to run away, combat in war is about survival and my feet would carry me out of danger. I'd hide for a bit and then exploit a major weakness. Other times I was near death and ran straight to the nearest underling for a quick death. It meant the bottom man on the totem poll got ranked a bit, but I avoided having the super elite Warchief grow in power. You also have a last chance move that saves your neck long enough to get out of most situations.Mordor boils down to a hack and slash game. It's Batman, but 100% combat focussed. Depending on your mood that might not be a bad thing, I spent 30 hours there. Solid 7.\"
2014,Middle Earth,"I think the 10/10 reviews are way off on this. To say the graphics are next gen is just not true - they're distinctly average - and the camera is a nightmare at times near walls.But, the gameplay is very enjoyable and the nemesis system is very good. I'd definitely recommend to other people based on this, but it's not a 10/10 game."
2014,Middle Earth,"Shadow of Mordor is a better assassin's creed game than any assassin's creed game.I spent a good 4 hours as soon as the game started roaming around stabbing orcs in the back, having a grand ol' time murdering anything that moved and hunting down captains before I even bothered getting into the main missions.The game really opens up and shows you it's true colors in the second halfShadow of Mordor is a better assassin's creed game than any assassin's creed game.I spent a good 4 hours as soon as the game started roaming around stabbing orcs in the back, having a grand ol' time murdering anything that moved and hunting down captains before I even bothered getting into the main missions.The game really opens up and shows you it's true colors in the second half with the addition of the ""Brand"" ability which allows you to convert enemies into your followers. Suddenly a 30 on 1 brawl looks less like an impossible disaster and more like an opportunity.The nemesis system is a lot of fun and I had many a ""Hey, I remember that guy!"" moment when a captain I killed came back with a metal eye-patch or a sack over his head screaming ""they call me bag head now!"" and with the brand power you can take control of those captains and ensure their rise in the ranks of Sauron's army, becoming a shadowy figure pulling their strings from behind a curtain as you lure your true foes out into the open and crush them with your army of carefully selected and trained up warchiefs.The only real complaints I have are the fiddly controls near walls, getting stuck on them when you try to walk around them can be a little annoying, and climbing around on archer towers trying to drop into the middle space can also be irritating.The lack of a smarter lock-on in combat means you'll end up combat-branding the same guy twice in a row and not him and his pal right next to him. There is no -hard- lock on either, so you have to contend with the soft lock on system and fiddly wiggle yourself around a bunch until the guy in the pack below you want to pounce on is lit up, this is especially a nuisance when the enemy has a group of bodyguards.The story is about average length for games these days, and it ends on a modern movie style ""sequel coming!"" note.It took about 3 solid days of playing to get ~most~ of the stuff in the game done, sidequests and all, I figure 4-5 days total if one were to try and platinum it AND just play the game.In all I would give this game a solid 8.6 out of 10, but since I can't, it's getting a 9.\"

What stands out is the Nemesis sytem, where you can hunt down and kill, or later on in the game, mind control them, Orcs. It's very fun and it's something I've never played before. That's what took up the bulk of my game time. Doing the side missions where you hunt them down and figure out a way to kill them is easily the best part of the game no questions asked. While the difficulty spikes if you run into an Orc with a special blend of strengths, there's no better thrill than to run into a stronghold and take down 100 guys before you fight a captain.The bad with this game starts with the graphics. While they aren't bad in some spots, in others they are absolutely terrible. The hair effects on the main character are PS2 worthy, and some of the other spots here and there are just absolutely terrible. The story is also terrible. While I commend them for trying to get away from the Lord of the Rings franchise and create a game based on Middle Earth itself, it failed miserably in the story department and decent performances by Troy Baker and the rest of the cast did nothing to save a terrible script. The ""final battle"" was super dull and I feel cheated a bit with how it ended. I haven't felt this cheated by a story since Mass Effect.There are other things that are bad including the camera and clipping stuff in the world but all these things combined don't hurt the experience too much. I feel like this is a good game that just was horribly crippled by the story and graphics. I like that they wanted to set themselves apart but they failed miserably and, that's too bad, cause there is major potential here for a decent franchise going forward. They really need to brush up the story before anything else happens though.\"
2014,Middle Earth,"This is no doubt the best LOTR game ever. The game creators have put lots of love in it, and it reflects on how fun and amazing this game is. Do yourself a favor and go buy this game."

Newbies be warned, it's a pretty challenging game. It's certainly not easy. But it 's refreshing to see a game that makes challenges you and doesn't cater to thick-skulled neanderthals like games have been lately. The voice acting is absolutely top notch. Troy Baker's performance as Talion rivals his portrayal of Joel in TLoU. Every voice actor I've heard so far has done an outstanding job, especially the ones for Ratbag and Gollum (I had to look it up because apparently Andy Serkis didn't do Gollum; the man they got to fill his shoes did a spectacular job). You'd be dumb not to pick this game up. The graphics are amazing, the orc characters models look unreal, the environments look stunning.9.5/10 for sure, but I'll round up.\"

There were great ups and then there were bland downs.I think the game is really bold in what it sets out to do. More often than not when you write a story within an already established world, you create new characters and tell their tales. I guess Talion and his story is exactly that, but everything else (and there's a plenty of that ""else"") goes hard on pre-established major characters. I can see why someone could be up in arms about the plot developement later in the game, but I don't really mind. The story overall was good, although I will say that some of the Main Missions didn't feel like Main Missions at all, and some of it just happened too quick.The gameplay? It's Assassin's Creed with Batman's combat, which if you asked me, is a significantly improved Assassin's Creed. Of course, aside from the combat being very solid, there are also plenty of other special tricks you can pull off to help you murder orcs. This is all great, but the major issue I had here was that you learn all those combat moves and tricks too slowly. When you've learned the bulk of them, the game is nearing it's end. And some of those are what I'd call core abilities! While opening all abilities slowly and letting the player choose the order is fine, this is something I've seen happen in other games too. I thought I had much more fun with the combat and orc slaughter later in the game than in the beginning. But when it was fun, it was really fun.The side missions and collectibles are alright. Or perhaps mediocre. There's an okay amount of them. What a lot of them do is add flavor to characters met during the main storyline, but those characters were only mentioned relatively briefly in the first place. I didn't really care reading more about them. ""Forging the legend"" of your weapons is a cool way to say ""combat""/""stealth""/""archery"" challenge. It's all fairly repetitive, but such is the nature of the beast.It's an interesting thing that there's no difficulty slider. I think it could use one, but there's two sides to that coin. The game gets harder everytime you die or use fast travel, but if you only die rarely and don't use fast travel, it actually never gets really hard. And I found avoiding death isn't actually hard, since running away from fights is really easy. So really, depending on how you're doing, you might find yourself wanting to turn the difficulty either up or down.All in all, if you liked either AC or Batman, you'll like this. If you'd like to play Orc Army Building Simulator, you're gonna love this. If you're a hardcore LotR fan, you probably think this one ruined LotR forever. If you're a casual fan, not so much.\"
2014,Middle Earth,"Wow, this game is so boring. At the start it seems promissing. Impressive animation and nice graphics. After a few missions it turns so repetitive that u do not even have fun anymore. Just smash buttons until you get tired of it. Very repititive.

Frustration aside, the game is otherwise a solid stealth-action game (when the controls cooperate), that is light on story and narration, but will fill the gap as we wait for (hopefully) better games, like the Witcher 3.  Shadows of Mordor suffers from the plight of many open-world games....namely, repetitive missions and collectibles that are there for filler.  Kill orcs...then kill some more...then some more...and then again.  Still, in a year when games ranged from horrible-to-mediocre, it stands out as better than many.  Beautiful graphics (for those that care about such things) and excellent voice acting (for the very few lines of dialogue).  A solid game, but too frustrating and repetitive to be an instant classic.\"

The DLC feels like an option for if you really love this game and want more rather than.. ""hey you wont enjoy this game until you fork over money for the season pass"".  With that I may buy the DLC once I have beaten the game.I can truly get lost playing this game.There are a few bugs in the game like where Celembrimdors spirit will stay frozen in spots you left wraith mode but its not game breaking.There are quick time events however it doesn't take away any immersion what so ever like a lot of quick time events do.Its definitely one of the better games out and I believe if you buy this game which you can find $40-$50 deals at best buy and the internet then you can be assured your money was well spent on an entertaining fun game.The story is interesting but honestly I just love the gameplay.  you have free roam to go wherever and the scenery in the game changes as you progress.  Grinding for upgrades is minimal and the side missions aren't dragged out and boring like assassins creed.If you get this game I would recommend upgrading your elf shot as much as you can and your wraith abilities because you will use it a lot and will be most helpful.The game is very rewarding and yet not too challenging.  you can't go hacking and slashing in a fight expecting to button mash your way through.  it takes some combat strategy much like batman arkham city.  The side missions make it rewarding to complete as you find new runes to play with the customize your ranger/wraith the way you want him to fight.  which is very unique... some runes can be burned to upgrade quicker.All in all i feel like the game catches up with my skill level to where its not too easy to where i can get bored easily.I enjoy having that feeling of revenge if an uruk kills me and I see him get promoted, then i go stalk him and hunt him down or I possess him so i can use him as my puppet to get me a big uruk army.  Sometimes i just let an uruk kill me just to watch the events unfold for him.My only disappointment (SPOILER SCROLL DOWN) is they killed off my favorite character Ratbag the Coward early in the game.  Was feeling attached to the little guy.There are also some moments that get annoying like trying to get talion to hang on one side of the wall then hangs on the opposite side where the uruks are however it still isn't game breaking.I do wish they would've gotten deeper into the hunting.However I will say this.. If you are curious about this game and you love assassins creed and the batman games then this will be for you.  Its one of the better games out there and monolith/WB did a great job releasing a game that feels like you got your money's worth. GREAT JOB.\"
