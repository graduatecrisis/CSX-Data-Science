"JeuxActu","85","By giving us the keys to its game design office, Nintendo has achieved yet another great game with Super Mario Maker.

"Eurogamer Poland","80","Super Mario Maker is a successful experiment that combines a great level editor with an endless stream of new content from the community. It turns out that the Princess is always in another castle, and the players will have to crawl through few million worlds to find her. Mamma Mia!"

"Destructoid","80","Super Mario Maker is a charming little creation tool, and I'm sure fans will come up with some amazing levels for years to come. However, it feels a bit more constrained than it needs to be, and is in dire need of updates or DLC to keep it going long term."
"VideoGamer","80","Super Mario Maker is an excellent creation tool and, thanks to the foundations it's been built on, a tremendous platformer. Its true potential is in the hands of the community, though, and anyone expecting anything else will probably be a little disappointed."
"Critical Hit","79","Super Mario Maker makes creating levels an easy, effortless exercise – letting true design shine through rather than hindering ideas by muddling with software. It’s just a pity that it takes too long to truly wrestle that power from Nintendo’s strict hand-holding."

"NZGamer","70","Trusting other players for quality levels is risky business, but making your own is creative heaven."
"Cubed3","70","For all its drawbacks in terms of relying on the gamer to actually put in the effort to enjoy the experience, Super Mario Maker is a fresh approach to the old 'RPG Maker' mould, taking the key elements that any 'build-a-game' title requires and then making sure that there are sufficient in-built goodies to give those less inclined to while away the hours making new content a sense of value for money."
"Metro GameCentral","70","If you accept its purposeful limitations this is one of the few successful attempts to ensure creating your own games is as much fun as playing them."
