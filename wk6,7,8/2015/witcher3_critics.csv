"LEVEL (Czech Republic)","100","The conclusion of Geralt’s game saga couldn’t be better. The large open world, great storytelling and dozens of hours of pure fun – this game is an absolute must for every RPG fan. [Issue#253]"
"The Digital Fix","100","You’ll not want it to end, just like you didn’t want your very favourite RPGs of years’ past to end either. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt will sit in that list now. There isn’t any higher praise."
"DarkStation","100","Make some room on your hard drive and shelf, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt deserves a permanent spot in your gaming library."
"We Got This Covered","100","The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt manages to constantly excite and amaze, with sublime storytelling and engrossing gameplay that never leaves you wanting more."
"Play UK","100","Quality like this doesn't tend to arrive until way later in a generation, so we doff our caps to the team at CDPR for breaking tradition to deliver one of the best RPGs we've ever played. [Issue#247, p.60]"
"Twinfinite","100","It is a shining example of what RPGs should be: an experience that makes you believe that you’re truly part of a game’s world and that you have a very real stake in it. That’s exactly what Wild Hunt has achieved here."
"Playstation Official Magazine Australia","100","The new benchmark for open-world Western RPGs on PS4. CD Projekt Red, we love the voodoo that you do in the Witcher 3.  [July 2015, p70]"
"Hardcore Gamer","100","The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is equal parts daunting, accessible, beautiful and hideous, but every aspect combines in such a remarkable way that it’s nearly impossible to not give it a sweeping recommendation."
"Digital Spy","100","Not only do you care about the characters and want to see how their stories end, but you want to scour every inch of The Witcher 3's glorious game world. It's a world you want to get lost in, a world where fast travel is an afterthought and a world you want to keep exploring in case there's something you've missed."
"Push Square","100","Its shockingly cohesive world is as beautiful as it is demanding, and it's packed full of mature content that throws you from one emotional response to the next. Its storytelling is superb, its combat is grippingly refined, and its often unforgiving nature only lends itself to a brilliantly rewarding experience."
"Gameplanet","100","The Witcher 3 is a triumph. CD Projekt has delivered a world that is epic and textured, and a narrative composed of swelling crescendos and artful asides. This is a studio at the top of its game delivering a title that’s now at the top of the field. Quite simply, The Witcher 3 is unmissable."
"Guardian","100","The way in which the developers manage to wrangle the various, divergent threads of your unique journey, with all of its composite choices and outcomes, while entirely concealing the seams is masterly."
"Telegraph","100","There is no saving the world, here, no great evil force pervading the landscape, or a doomsday clock ticking down to inevitable destruction, with only you to stand in its way. The story of Wild Hunt is a personal one, set in a huge and unrelentingly beautiful world."
"Eurogamer Poland","100","The Witcher 3 is a masterpiece, and in many respects simply the best and most exciting game in recent years. It captivates players with artistic vision, a huge world and an epic story. The developers were not looking for cheap applause - game design is uncompromising, consistent, thoughtful and nuanced."
"AusGamers","100","It’s a story worthy of a place in the more accepted subculture of dark fantasy ruled across media by Game of Thrones. First-timers will easily love this facet but may also be surprised to learn that this series, and the books it’s based upon, have been the at the fore of adult and mature storytelling for a long time. Wild Hunt is both at times brutal and sexy, with a juxtaposition of hard-edged steel (or silver), blood and death being met with soft, naked skin; passion, lust and even love."
"Impulsegamer","100","This game has got characters that you actually care about, a story that is very engaging from the get go and almost flawless gaming mechanics."
"GameSpot","100","One of the best role-playing games ever crafted, a titan among giants and the standard-setter for all such games going forward. Where the Witcher 2 sputtered to a halt, The Witcher 3 is always in a crescendo, crafting battle scenarios that constantly one-up the last, until you reach the explosive finale and recover in the glow of the game's quiet denouement."
"Atomix","98","The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a perfect example of how studios should be developing videogames. CD Projekt Red presents us an epic adventure that works in every single way. Is hard to find the right words to do justice to this masterpiece that everyone must try."
"GameTrailers","98","The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a thoughtful, diverse, and frequently awe-inspiring adventure. Its stories are deep and satisfying, unafraid to touch on themes of personal character, presenting players with choices and consequences that aren’t about turning into a hero or a villain. In the end, it’s quite simply one of the best RPGs ever made."
"Game Informer","98","It stands out for its wonderful writing, variety of quests and things to do in the world, and how your choices have impact in interesting ways."
"Meristation","96","The end of a fantastic journey, it´s an extremely ambitious game, a real tour de force that shows CD Projekt will continue to shine. Really big, dense, with a nice narrative pace that mixes well with the open world structure. A stunning game."
"CD-Action","95","This truly outstanding game raises the bar to new heights that will be extremely hard to reach for BioWare, Bethesda and any other developer. [07/2015, p.38]"
"RPG Fan","95","The Witcher 3 presents a realistic, engaging, and dark fantasy world. With fast-paced combat, deep character customisation, and massive locations to explore, it's a game not to be missed."
"EGM","95","The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is far more than a fantasy role-playing game. It’s an amazingly fleshed-out world that rewards careful, thoughtful exploration. CD Projekt RED didn’t just deliver on their promise to craft an open world worthy of author Andrzej Sapkowski’s lore—they greatly exceeded it."
"Playstation Universe","95","A masterclass in open-world game design, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt packs every pixel of its gorgeous world with compelling fiction and believable, satisfying role-playing."
"Critical Hit","95","An impeccable role-playing game, and one of the finest games ever created. Whether it's as large as tracking the Wild Hunt or as small as delivering a love letter, The Witcher 3 makes Geralt's actions count in the most incredible ways - creating a world begging to be explored for countless hours on end."
"Gamer.nl","95","The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is almost perfect. There are a few flaws in the way and the game is not as demanding as it's predecessor, but the tsunami of content that keeps you busy is amazing. The world of the Wild Hunt is so much more than just a pretty picture."
"PlayStation LifeStyle","95","While minor design choices keep it from being absolutely perfect, The Witcher 3 will go down as one of the best games of this generation of consoles."
"Multiplayer.it","95","It’s simply bigger, more intense and with an amazing graphic design. The Witcher 3 is something every RPG player must play."
"IGN Spain","95","The perfect farewell to one of the most important figures in the world of role-playing in video games, but hopefully not our last visit to this fascinating world."
"JeuxActu","95","The Witcher 3 is a captivating game and a gorgeous title. Thanks to a very inspired artistic department, offering an even more accurate view on the gloomy world Geralt lives in, this third part proves itself as one of the most beautiful games ever made. But there is more: if CD Projekt took its game open-world, it's not simply for the sake of doing so. They handcrafted a very lively, very concrete universe in which you can enjoy your freedom to be the witcher you always wanted to be."
"XGN","95","The Witcher III: Wild Hunt is one of the best RPG games ever made. Its (main) story, excellent visuals, challenging quests and beautiful world makes this one of the best games in 2015."
"3DJuegos","95","An amazing amount of content and a great story with many possible choices and consequences work pretty well with The Witcher series’ sandbox twist despite its numerous shortcomings."
"Hobby Consolas","95","The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is the best reason to make you buy a new console or a high-end PC. The new Geralt's adventure is huge, adult, surprising and always stunning. Everything we love about videogames."
"Games Master UK","94","A strong contender to be called the best fantasy RPG of all time. Absolutely essential. [July 2015, p.60]"
"Pelit (Finland)","94","Wild Hunt feels like an old folktale. The story is beautiful, funny and creepy at the same time, dialogue and characters set a new milestone for other game writers. Witcher 3 could be one of the best games ever made: only the ending of the story and battle system could be better. [June 2015]"
"ActionTrip","94","The Witcher 3 is an engaging, overwhelmingly lengthy gaming experience with a staggering amount of characters to meet and places to explore."
"Game World Navigator Magazine","94","No one can avoid their fate, especially if they happen to be a witcher with a very particular destiny. Of course, the end of this story depends on your choice between personal happiness and world’s stability, duty and destiny, selfless love and mutual one – but we all know what Sapkowski’s Geralt would’ve chosen. [June 2015,p.56]"
"LaPS4","94","RPGs have a new king with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. CD Projekt RED has turned Adrzej Sapkowski's work into an amazing interactive spectacle in terms of visuals, plot and gameplay mechanics. Every hour invested in this game will be an hour of fun. The only disappointment is the optimization of the game on PS4. Frequent frame rate drops blur the experience. An issue we expect to be solved with updates but, for now, are quite a burden while playing."
"Vandal","94","The amount of content we find in The Witcher 3 is outstanding, as is its quality. It is true that there are some aspects with some room for improvement, but it delivers such a rich and unique universe that you will soon forget about them."
"Merlin'in Kazanı (Turkey)","93","This world doesn't need a hero, it needs games like The Wither 3. Be ready for an unforgettable experience and say Goodbye your social life."
"IGN","93","Even if the plot isn’t terribly interesting, the many characters who play a part in it are, and along with the excellent combat and RPG gameplay, they elevate The Witcher 3 to a plane few other RPGs inhabit."
"IGN Italia","91","The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt isn’t perfect (yet?), but it’s one of the best written RPGs ever."
"games(TM)","90","Wild Hunt is a masterpiece of open-world design in which it feels like every last detail has had the same level of care, thought and attention paid to by the team that created the game. It is fascinating to explore, consistently rewarding, always engaging and cements CD Projekt Red’s reputation as a studio to watch."
"GameOver.gr","90","The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is one of those rare cases of games that proves that the future of gaming lies in the past and the glory days of hardcore RPG gaming."
"Game Rant","90","The Witcher 3 is messy, highly emotional, and incredibly addictive. Barring any huge surprises this fall, The Witcher 3 should be a shoo-in for the game of the year – it’s not just one of 2015’s best games, but for many players, it’s the only one they’ll need."
"Slant Magazine","90","Experience is earned largely through quests, not battle alone, which highlights CD Project RED's emphasis on thoughtful storytelling over mindless bloodshed."
"Shacknews","90","It’s been a heck of a ride, with the story twisting and tearing my heart out every chance I gave it. Most of this heartbreak stems from the choices that I made, which is why I love this series so much. Even so, some of the simplified elements like potion crafting or combat left me wishing it had kept more of its legacy intact."
"PSX-Sense.nl","90","Gigantic world, intriguing story, enjoyable combat and quest overload... that's The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. An action RPG fan's dream come true."
"Worth Playing","90","If you're an RPG fan, you owe it to yourself to give The Witcher 3 a shot. It rivals the best that Bethesda and Bioware have to offer, and you'll be hard-pressed to find a better RPG this year."
"Digitally Downloaded","90","It's not the most artful, the most intelligent, or the most important, but it's certainly going to be the most spectacular. And I know for a lot of players out there, the spectacle is all that matters."
"USgamer","90","The Witcher III: Wild Hunt is probably one of the most well-crafted RPG worlds yet...Is it perfect? No, the combat is rote at times and the inventory and crafting needs work, but in the end, The Witcher III is a top-notch RPG experience."
"Gamer.no","90","Geralt is back and better than ever. A huge, beautiful world filled with adventure and improved combat mechanics makes The Witcher 3 a Game of the Year-contender."
"TheSixthAxis","90","The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is easily one of the most engrossing games I’ve had the chance to play. The story and characters are well worth the experience alone, and the world expertly draws on the desire to explore with its massive scale."
"Arcade Sushi","90","There are times when Wild Hunt just can't live up to its own development team's expectations, but for the most part, The Witcher 3 is an amazing experience."
"Cheat Code Central","90","Even with these complaints, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is one of the best RPGs I have ever experienced in gaming. There’s so much to this adventure, you’d be missing out on a great experience if you pass it up."
"VideoGamer","90","Every interaction is an intrigue. Not only is the dialogue superbly acted, but I can see every emotion the voice is trying to convey in each character’s face."
"Level7.nu","90","The Witcher 3 is one of the most hyped games this spring, but it's also one ofthe best. CD Project Red has managed to build a huge world that isboth interesting and entertaining to explore. Add to that a well-crafted combat system and good opportunities to customize your character."
"4Players.de","90","This role-playing marvel creates an impressive atmosphere in an open world, focusing on the silent moments and the exploration as much as on spectacular fighting. The quest quality is high throughout and the storytelling is out of this world – not only for ten or dozens but for a hundred hours."
"Gameblog.fr","90","Gorgeous, generous, incredibly well written and fun to play, The Witcher's story conclusion is far from a disappointment. It's an amazing open-world RPG, looking like Skyrim and Grand Theft Auto's child, offering so many wonderful and lively places to explore, so many tasks to accomplish, so many fantastic stories and characters, so many great battles to fight, that it will take hours to explore the entire thing. A solid masterpiece that you can't seriously miss if you like RPGs - and have plenty of time to play."
"Metro GameCentral","90","A colossal achievement in technical terms, with a level of interaction with the game world and its inhabitants that is unsurpassed in modern video games."
"Eurogamer Italy","90","The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is an awesome dark fantasy game, with perfect storytelling, a beautifully crafted world and powerful characters. Due to the open world structure and its huge dimension, this game has some technical issues, yet the final experience is still one of the best around for RPG lovers."
"Everyeye.it","90","When it comes to story, lore and characters, The Witcher 3 is simply stunning, a milestone in western RPGs. Although the gameplay is quite varied, and the offer in terms of quests and exploration rich, the combat system still lacks depth, and structure as questing never changes. As it is, it's a perfect game for whoever like to dive deep into a believable and vast imaginary world, but not for gameplay purists."
"GamesBeat","88","Playing The Witcher 3 with an eye for grand strategy can be both a densely engrossing and mechanically frustrating, overlong adventure. When played one move at a time, however, Wild Hunt is the supreme alchemical distillation of the role-playing experience. It’s a bleakly human play at the heart of a dark fantasy."
"Kill Screen","87","No other developer has brought an open world to life the way CD Projekt Red has here."
"PSX Extreme","87","If you’ve ever wanted to become fully immersed in a fantastical universe with absolutely everything you could ever hope to have in an in-depth, unbelievably robust role-playing game, it’s right here."
"GamesVillage.it","87","The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a great game, that is a fact. Its world is astonishingly huge, and it will keep everyone busy for months to come. The storytelling simply raises the bar for every other action RPG out there. Most of the flaws of the game are caused by its own ambition, and not everything can be fixed by a patch. Wonderful indeed, but not the masterpiece we were hoping for."
"CGMagazine","85","The Witcher III has a compelling plot, combined with some old school, complex game systems that encourage exploration, crafting and experimentation. It has some rough spots, but when the plot and characters suck you in the way The Witcher III does, it’s worth forgiving the unrefined aspects of the game for the expansive world and engaging, morally ambiguous storytelling."
"NZGamer","85","We’re still left with a good RPG, but one that’s held back somewhat by tedious quest design and an overreliance on sexist cliches."
"InsideGamer.nl","85","The Witcher 3 is much more sloppy and than expected, and the graphic quality of the Northern Kingdoms is a disappointment. However, the game is still so good that we accept these issues. This fantasy world is great, offers plenty of detail and keeps pulling you back in."
"SpazioGames","85","Gigantic, with a majestic world, a brilliant narrative, great dialogue and characters, The Witcher 3 fails miserably when it comes to pure gameplay. Its simplistic combat system and repetitive quest structure are a monster that even Geralt cannot kill."
"GRYOnline.pl","85","The Witcher 3 is a game aiming for highest praise - you simply can't get enough of it. The need to see what happens next kept me glued to the console for many more hours than I had planned. Unfortunately the The Wild Hunt isn't perfect - the number of smaller and bigger issues can surprise (in a bad way, of course). It is an amazing game but right now the amount of bugs is simply too high."
"Polygon","80","The Witcher 3's subject matter, its almost defiant doubling down on its treatment of women as titillating props for Geralt and the player, even as it tries to flesh out more female leads, is its most disappointing aspect. This constant presence weighs down what would otherwise be an excellent bit of closure for Geralt's video game saga — which isn't helped by the control issues that often detract from sequences meant to break up open-world monotony."
"Edge Magazine","80","[CD Projekt's] reputation as a studio of remarkable technical prowess has been tarnished a little, however noble its intentions. [July 2015, p.98]"
"Dealspwn","80","While the decidedly average combat and alarming number of technical gremlins are disappointing for a title that's been in development for so long, The Witcher III: Wild Hunt is still a must-buy title for genre fans."
"Destructoid","80","The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a huge step up from its predecessor, mostly because it manages to tell a more compelling and personal tale. At the same time, that intimate feel is juxtaposed against a gigantic, sprawling open-world adventure that may hit some snags along the way but still comes out on top."
"GamesRadar+","80","Sloppy combat and ongoing optimisation can't quite spoil this dark fantasy adventure, set in a stunning world of blood and black magic."
"Playstation Official Magazine UK","80","The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a surprising failure as an open-world video game, but within its beautifully lit world of monsters lies a much more traditional story-driven RPG of immense quality."
"Game Revolution","70","It spends a great deal of its energy trying to impress the audience with unparalleled scope. The result is an experience that succeeds in its mission of being a grand experience, but commonly missteps when it comes to fundamentals such as combat, leveling systems, and user interface design."
