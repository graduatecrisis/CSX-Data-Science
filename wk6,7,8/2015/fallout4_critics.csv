"Slant Magazine","100","If traveling through Bethesda's version of Boston for 60 hours has taught me anything, it's that the little things are what matter."
"Telegraph","100","If you’ve been waiting for Fallout 4, it will simultaneously meet your expectations and exceed them in others. Who would have thought a Fallout game would convince us of Bethesda’s storytelling and shooter credentials? In a year full of brilliant open-world games like The Witcher 3, it manages to stand apart from the crowd and deliver something that feels fresh, despite its familiar foundations."
"Digital Spy","100","Graphical niggles aside, Fallout 4 feels like a culmination of the fantastic work Bethesda did on Fallout 3, New Vegas and Skyrim, surpassing them all in terms of scope and scale."
"PSNStores","100","With those issues and caveat, Fallout 4 has to be the most addicting and content heavy-game we’ve played on the Playstation 4. Looking forward to spending many more countless hours exploring every nook and cranny of the Commonwealth."
"GamesRadar+","100","A huge game that's anything you want it to be. An immense RPG, shooter, and world to explore that is only constrained by your imagination and desire to explore."
"Gaming Nexus","98","Fallout 3 was seven years ago. Fallout 4 is one you can play, off and on, for the next seven. Congratulations, Bethesda: You’ve outdone yourselves again. You’ve made the Wasteland more beautiful, ugly, open ended, funneled down, thoughtful, and frantic than ever."
"Digital Chumps","96","Fallout 4 is another amazing achievement from Bethesda Studios. It encompasses the beauty of its brethren, while introducing a bigger, better world for gamers to explore and reside in. It’s everything people were expecting, possibly a bit more."
"3DJuegos","95","With its vast open world and its endless possibilities, Fallout 4 is a must have for RPG fans."
"Hobby Consolas","95","Bethesda brings us one of the best games of 2015. It will be the game of the year for many people, for sure. It offers an incredible amount of game options, length, fun and gameplay possibilities but, most of all, it offers a ""real"" world to live in for the coming months."
"The Jimquisition","95","What I can say is that Fallout 4 is a wild ride that gets its hooks in you deep, with a number of welcome improvements and a settlement management system that could be its own entirely separate game. All that, and not a single microtransaction in sight, despite the game being easily structured for such a horrible business practice to slide right in. That is impressive."
"Playstation Universe","95","Fallout 4 captivates with a hauntingly beautiful apocalypse and refuses to let go. Exceptional gameplay is marred by a few flaws, but the Wasteland’s flaws have never been fewer."
"IGN","95","Great new reasons to obsessively gather and hoard relics of happier times, strong companions, and sympathetic villains driving tough decisions make it an adventure I’ll definitely replay and revisit. Even the technical shakiness that crops up here and there can’t even begin to slow down its momentum."
"IGN Spain","94","Fallout 4 is the game you've been waiting for months (maybe years?), and it will provide you fun for weeks."
"Multiplayer.it","92","Fallout 4 is a marvelous post-atomic RPG with a lot of content and a perfect setting. It's sad that from a technical aspect it's extremely short of our expectations and it has a simple storyline."
"Vandal","92","Fallout 4 makes you say goodbye to the rest of the world and immerse yourself in its universe for hours and hours. Its powerful virtues compensate for its obvious shortcomings."
"LaPS4","92","Just like meeting an old friend. Like coming home after a long time away. That is Fallout 4. The best of the franchise comes back, as good as always, but with many interactive options. If you're looking for a game with the potential of lasting several hundred hours of pure amusement, Fallout 4 is your game."
"Playstation Official Magazine Australia","90","Feral Ghoul ugly in many ways, but beneath its iffy exterior beats the heart of one helluva great RPG. Get past the graphics deficiency, and the sheer thrill of Fallout 4’s combat, crafting options, and exploring will hold your attention for months. [January 2015, p64]"
"Dealspwn","90","While there may be bugs everywhere, it’s hard not to be in awe of the extensive open world Bethesda have created with the Commonwealth. Streamlined progression, an improved narrative, and extensive customisation make Fallout 4 a serious contender to the RPG throne."
"PSX Extreme","90","Fallout 4 is a masterful production that features a wildly ambitious and nigh-on unparalleled scope. There’s just so much to do that it often feels overwhelming, but this isn’t going to stop the franchise faithful. In fact, I’m sure they’ll welcome the deluge of options, content, and endless exploration."
"4Players.de","90","Fallout 4 has its flaws, such as weak AI, a few annoying bugs, stiff facial animations and the occasional control problem. But it more than makes up for them with a beautiful post-apocalyptic world filled with well-constructed quests, interesting characters and mesmerizing locations. Fallout 4 tells loads of big and small bizarre, tragic and touching stories that stay in your memory and create a maelstrom dragging you in deeper and deeper."
"COGconnected","90","Complex, full of depth and infinitely customizable, Fallout 4 manages to stand above its glitches and odd subpar animations to be an experience well worth having."
"NZGamer","90","The same loveable Fallout formula far outweighs bugs and directionless new systems."
"GamingTrend","90","Fallout 4 may be an iterative step forward for the series, but it is every bit what RPG fans know, love, and expect."
"PSX-Sense.nl","90","Fallout 4 contains a huge amount of content, with stand-outs as an interesting story, the renewed VATS-system and the ability to build settlements. Some graphical bugs, AI issues and long loading times keep it from reaching the top mark."
"ActionTrip","90","The ambient soundtrack is stirring, well produced and adds to the overall experience."
"Gameblog.fr","90","Fallout 4 has some flaws. But it gives to fans of the series and of Bethesda's RPG exactly what they want and need: an overwhelming open world in an outstanding universe, with great tools to progress and great freedom of choice. Very pleasant, very difficult to resist and very very time-consuming."
"GameTrailers","90","For the last decade, Bethesda games have had similar issues, and it’s getting harder to forgive. Somehow, in spite of everything, Fallout 4 consumed us. When we’re not wandering the wastes, it overwhelms our thoughts as we ponder where to go, which faction to pursue, and what weapon to try next. Fallout 4 is flawed in very serious ways, but it’s also the only thing we want to do."
"Twinfinite","90","Even with its issues, Fallout 4 never fails to impress. It took the dead expanse of previous iterations and breathed a type of life that takes good care not to betray the experience fans have come to know and love."
"The Escapist","90","Whether or not players find other changes displeasing, such as the new dialogue system and its limitations, is likely going to depend on their personal relationship with the Fallout series. Newer players will probably never know what they're missing and are likely to have a fantastic time, while fans who have stuck around may be disappointed with the direction Fallout 4 takes."
"Game Revolution","90","Fallout 4 is a roaring response to criticism that the series has ignored its qualities as a shooter in favor of its deeper and stronger RPG roots. Nearly every design change in Fallout 4 poises the game as a more streamlined modern shooter with high production value across the truly open-world Commonwealth wasteland."
"USgamer","90","Bethesda plays it surprisingly safe with the formula, but they also do a much better job with the story this time around, serving to elevate the game as a whole. While there's no denying that it can be a bit ridiculous at times, its sheer scope speaks for itself. Bethesda has succeeded in crafting yet another fascinating open-world RPG."
"VideoGamer","90","The fact of the matter is, though, that this is more of the same, even if that 'same' has been pushed to new heights. If you hated Fallout 3, then there's not much to get you onside here. If you loved it, then you'll love this all the more, because of its differences as well as its similarities."
"Push Square","90","Fallout 4 is a masterclass in open world design. Consistently engrossing and absolutely stuffed with intricacies, it's a title that'll keep you enthralled for hours at a time as you gradually unravel its desolate yet hopeful post-apocalyptic portrayal of Boston. Although it's let down by some disappointing frame rate issues, it's not enough to detract from what's otherwise one of the most atmospheric and beautifully brutal games on the PS4."
"GameSpot","90","Fallout 4 is an engrossing game that lures you in with mystery and the promise of adventure. Its wretched wasteland can be captivating, and you never know what odd person or settlement lies around the next bend."
"IGN Italia","89","The look is not up to what is expected from a 2015 top production, but looking past it you can find a really addictive Open World RPG. Fallout 4 is as good as its predecessor, or even more: a must buy for every fan of the saga out there."
"Critical Hit","85","Fallout 4 carries over a number of problems from the past, and some of the more streamlined changes end up hampering the experience - but despite all of that, it’s a fantastic game that delivers one of the most compelling and addictive worlds this year."
"Atomix","85","A thrilling, engaging, post-apocalyptic Boston awaits. Dark humor combines with a serious narrative that makes us think about the value of human life in this huge glitchy world that is barely contained within a game disc."
"InsideGamer.nl","85","Fallout 4 isn't just a sandbox game, it's a playground. It brings such joy to discover new areas and characters, or to create your own weapons."
"RPG Fan","85","It's more Fallout. If you liked Fallout 3, you'll probably like this."
"ZTGD","85","There’s a ton of things to do and remember in this game, and while I enjoy what it does, it never really explains much of it. It took me way longer than I wanted to actually learn how to build and maintain my bases, and the tutorial is minimal at best."
"Forbes","85","Fallout 4’s greatest triumph, and its one major point of evolution is in its storytelling, crafting a lengthy, unexpected ending and resolution that I will remember for years to come. It also remains one of the best games in existence for those who simply like to wander and explore and unearth long-buried secrets. But it struggles with archaic gameplay systems and an inflexible engine that anchor the game to the past for all the wrong reasons. Fans may enjoy more Fallout and a brand new map to explore, but this sequel will not be heralded as revolutionary or overly impressive this time around."
"Everyeye.it","85","It doesn't have the same impact that Fallout 3 had seven years ago, and there's no doubt about that. It's also less RPG and more action, especially when you look at how the combat system has changed, but that can work if you accept the evolution. Fallout 4 is a solid free roaming experience, vast and interesting to discover, but not a game that defines new standards for the genre."
"Worth Playing","85","It's bigger and more detailed than its predecessor. The gameplay is streamlined, which largely seems to benefit the combat and exploration at a cost to the dialogue and non-combat elements. There are few things as fun as grabbing your pipe rifle and wandering into the Wasteland to find a new ruin to explore or a new settlement to create. Beyond the main plot, there are possibly hundreds of hours of things to see and do. Fallout 3 fans should find a lot to love here, and newcomers to the franchise will find a great place to start."
"Playstation Official Magazine UK","80","A strong return for the franchise, boasting incredible customisation, a fascinating world and brutal yet brainy shooting, slightly tarnished by lacklustre AI and tedious inventory management. [Christmas 2015, p.88]"
"New York Daily News","80","The Wasteland has never been this beautiful. And it's never been this muddled and flawed. And maybe that's exactly how a Wasteland is supposed to be. This is Fallout 4, arguably the most anticipated game of 2015 - and a beautiful, elegant mess."
"Digitally Downloaded","80","Fallout 4 still has its issues, especially around glitches. Bethesda will probably never learn there (and, given sales and hype behind the game, Bethesda knows it doesn't actually need to learn). However, the game itself works by building a closer connection between player and narrative, and a settlement system that gives players a genuine excuse simply to live within a world."
"PlayStation LifeStyle","80","It’s a bit rough around the edges in some areas and could do with a dab of polish. Regardless of these small faults, the stories told and discovered are fascinating and the Commonwealth is immensely interesting to explore."
"Shacknews","80","Fallout 4 is exactly and precisely more Fallout. Its couple of new gameplay elements are well-executed and enrich the experience, but they don't make this feel especially different than the Wasteland we were exploring almost a decade ago. If you enter looking for a heaping helping of the Fallout action you already enjoy, and an enthralling romp through a newly realized portion of the Wasteland, this certainly fits the bill. Just don't hope for another revolution, because like war, the Wasteland apparently never changes."
"Metro GameCentral","80","Its technical faults and lack of innovation are frustrating, but the game underneath is as enthralling and compulsive as anything Bethesda has ever made."
"CGMagazine","80","Fallout 4 is a bit of a mixed bag. While it’s certainly enjoyable and I highly recommend it, I’m not sure if this is the revolutionary Fallout title that we’ve all been waiting for. It really feels less like Fallout 4 and more like Fallout 3.75. Longtime fans will definitely find a game they love here, without question (I do too), and newcomers will find a game that’s a little easier to approach and equally enjoyable to get into."
"Eurogamer Italy","80","Fallout 4 is a huge, charming and deep experience, but it's too similar to Fallout 3. Seven years is a long time for videogames, and we can't believe that Bethesda couldn't make more changes to the formula in this time span."
"Kill Screen","76","Bethesda’s team creates maps that are a joy to explore."
"GameOver.gr","70","Fallout 4 leans to the Shooting side of things. It strips down the gameplay from the actual RPG elements and offers a meta-nuclaer shooting gallery which of course keep its charm and gameplay wealth but also feels a little too friendly for the new comers. The Base builder mode is unnecessary, boring and irritating. Unfortunately, overall, there are no steps forward for this Nuclear Holocaust Behemoth of the video games industry. Only steps sideways."
"Time","70","I can’t shake the feeling I’m really playing Fallout 3 season two. I guess it’s time to acknowledge the elephant in the room: CD Projekt Red’s masterful The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt this spring completely reset my expectation levels for storytelling, voice acting, pacing and congruous world design...There’s nothing Fallout 4 does worse than Fallout 3, that much you can depend on."
"Cheat Code Central","68","My hype to see how Bethesda would interpret all these innovations and incorporate them into the Fallout setting turned to disappointment when I stumbled through a game that features the same poorly-implemented combat and all the same old Gamebryo engine annoyances and glitches we've been dealing with for years."
"Giant Bomb","60","There's a great game in Fallout 4, but how much of that greatness gets through to you is largely dependent on your own tolerance levels for those glitches and how willing you are to play another game from the same template as Skyrim, Fallout: New Vegas, Fallout 3, and Oblivion."
"Guardian","60","Fallout 4, then, is a paradox, delivering in many of the areas that matter most but undermined throughout by poor combat, technical problems, and what feels like a lack of focus. So here we go again. It’s not war, but Bethesda that never changes."
"RPGamer","60","The problem comes from the fact that this feels like more of the same, not a step forward. Fallout 4 doesn't break the same new ground Fallout 3 did with its jump to 3D, and its storytelling and intricacy of choice falls short of what New Vegas offered...Fallout 4 just feels safe, even when trying new things."
