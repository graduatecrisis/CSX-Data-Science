10,"Very awesome game, reminds me of Red Dead Redemption, Skyrim, and Dragon Age. Bringing the best of those together in a world bigger than GTA V is truly something magnificent. While also telling a very good and mature story in a beautiful setting. Ladies and Gentlemen... Let me present The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. Say goodbye to life for a while! 10/10"
9,"Awsome game, nice graph, awsome story line and voiceover. Controls can be more responsive, but is good camera in fight can be better..  If you looking cool story, and fights this game its for you!"

It's the most beautiful open world to date with rock solid gameplay and excellent performance ( day 1 patch is a must for frame-rate dips issues, but after that installed you're good to go).If you consider Polish studio with only 200 strong staff and half the budget of EA, Ubisoft are pumping into the same crap year after year, you will quickly realize how exceptional in all aspects Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is.I could go on and praise this game all day long but I have quests to do, and then some.10/10 Must Buy or GTFO. ;)…"
10,"The best RPG i have ever played. Amazing character creation. Nicely designed quests. Very rich bestiary. World map is very big and full of content. Almost no loading screens!"
10,"Amazing game with great gameplay and story. This game is while the third in the series, is still a great jumping point and CD Projekt Red has done a good job at explaining the backstory. Granted playing the other games and reading the books will allow you to get more out of it, playing this game is still a must for anyone with a ps4, xbox one or a pc strong enough to run it."
10,"Best RPG game ever ! Large diverse open world , mass quests, addictive gameplay . For such a game I waited and did not deceived. Congratulations to the Polish developer."
10,"Ive have only played this game for some 22 hours now, and I haven't even left the starting area yet. Im simply in awe of the beauty of this game, constantly finding myself just starring at the screen and the changing environment. I haven't seen this much attention to detail since GTA V, and that is the only other game on the current gen consoles i would give a 10.

10,"This will go down as one of the best rpg's ever created.  It's mind blowing in scope and quality and very refreshing to have an adult oriented rpg.  This is a harsh, realistic and brutal world"
10,"One of the best games ever made. Swimming mechanics need some tweaking, but this is not enough to rid it of a deserved 10/10. A masterpiece of art and gameplay."
10,"This is officially the best game of all time! It's beautiful, combat is perfection and everything was  created so incredibly that I would want to live in this world forever! Reality has become obsolete now!;-)Thanks CD projekt red ! You are by far the best game developer in history! Love you all!!;-)"
10,"May I call The Witcher 3 ""Adult version of Dragon Age Inquisition''? Or same level as Skyrim? Because of the amazing story, fantastic living open world. I'm going to spent hundreds of hours into this game ^^"
10,"This is not only great game but also, a great story! It is deep and exciting without ""fedex' quests. That' is something that for example Dragon Age definately was missing."
10,"Take a bit of Skyrim, Red Dead Redemption, The Wolf Among Us and add following ingrediences: most beautiful and dense open World ever created, hard but rewarding combat and the most memorable side quests ever created from which many are dramatic storylines on its own. This masterpiece is what you get!"
10,"Fantastic game, the world is so dynamic and huge it's truly incredible. There is alot of stuff to do, the characters are interesting and the plot as in all games is great. If you're an RPG fan than you should immediately  get this game!"

10,"I haven't even opened the box yet and I'm excited. Giving it 10/10 cause it has horses in it. What also helps is that Geralt seems to have a beard in this one, and I am a fan of beards. I find them comforting."

3,"What a staggering disappointment.First off: The controls of Geralt is an abomination.Everyone do this test; Watch how in his first two steps after you first push on the controller, they are really slow steps, and then he moves into stride - It's terrible. What precision and control is possible with that ?Then this test: run straight and then immediately push directly left or rightWhat a staggering disappointment.First off: The controls of Geralt is an abomination.Everyone do this test; Watch how in his first two steps after you first push on the controller, they are really slow steps, and then he moves into stride - It's terrible. What precision and control is possible with that ?Then this test: run straight and then immediately push directly left or right on your gamepad - after that turn, Geralt stops slowly, turns like a slow moving robot, and then moves again. It's insane.The basis of the main characters movement has gigantic flaws that makes this game unplayable.Not only that but all his movement is sugglish and non-resonsive, and when the combat is difficulty already, it makes the gameplay in the Witcher 3 an exercise in endless frustration. And it was built this way. AMAZING.The players animation when on rocks, against trees, sliding down a hill etc, is all terrible. The physical connection of Geralt to this nice looking world when exploring, is awful.If they fixed the controls, the combat would still be really boring. None of the early enemies showed much intelligence or proved an interesting or visceral fight. Hit by weapon animation when you hit the enemies leaves no strong impact, and the AI behaviour in combat very soon into the game feels very repetitive. Sure you have some strategy with the Signs, but it's still in a dull combat system against plain enemies.The positive: is that some of the writing is vastly improved from the Witcher 2, and even most games.But you have to spend such a long time traversing what is a pretty nice designed world, but that setting quality is still not high enough on it's own and for all that imposed length extending traversal imperative, or as compensation for the really poor controls and gameplay.…"

Much of the combat in-game is purely based on timing.The average gamer is going to love how the game looks, but hate how it plays. RPG's live and die  by how well their combat system is received, and this game's combat system is an unintuitive, poorly-timed and oddly-keystroked mess.See all those good reviews? I'm pretty sure they're all just too mesmerized by how good the graphics look. It's a shame the way you interface with them is such a turd.…"

0,"Witcher 3's combat gameplay is just horrible, i just bought it because everyone is praising it.Gameplay is medicore at best to be honest. I agree with people saying Witcher 3 have good story.

When it comes to games, GAMEPLAY is more important than STORY.This game have the same problem as Bioshock Infinite. As good as people say it is. The story is all it is good for. The combat is lackluster and I would rather watch Bioshock Infinite as a movie than play the game. I would rather watch people play the game than playing it myself.This is coming from a guy who enjoys Dark Souls, Monster Hunter series, God Eater, etc.And we all know how much dodging and rolling there is in games like Monster Hunter.But Witcher 3's rolling is just.. Unsatisfying, overly obsessive rolling and spinning.Monster Hunter's rolling = precise timing to dodge a hit that would otherwise kill you. Rolling eats up your stamina bar so every roll has it's purpose.Witcher 3's rolling = You might as well be the Tasmanian Devil. Because spinning and rolling is the new style. I think Geralt is dancing and spinning like a fool when he attacks and its always the same.He does switch the swords automaticly in this game.CAMERA while fighting is the worst CAMERA i have ever seen in a videogame, really and this game has such a high rating?Story is good, but for the most part people are talking nonsense when you speak with them.graphics have a downgrade but are still looking good.this game is a let down like destiny, the order and watchdogs to be honest and it doesnt live up to the hype.My hopes are Batman and MGS5.…"
3,"Most of the things in this game are very good.. BUT!!!!! The camera and controls in general, are just unbelievably bad. It is clumsy and unprecisly, makes it a little difficult to loot sometimes, some fight combats looks a bit ugly because of it, and it is just enoying that you run around/running into things and people like a confussed animal or something.

If you have played the buggy Assasins Creed then you probably know little about how it feels like.It irritates me, cause this game got so much potentiale. It have potential of course, but the bad controls just ruins the experience a bit. I really dont see the point about making a game with that much content, without making some of the most important basic things optimal. It feels like the game is unfinished, and i would LOVE if they could patch this problem, then it would be a really good game.…"

This would be a great game if the choppy/jerky camera was sorted out.

Alas no though.…"

The combat was beyond clunky. Enemies were uninteresting and bland. The spells had no appeal or flash. The menus were combersome. The inventory was filled with way too many items that served no purpose until dozens of hours into the game. Repairing items was a frustrating nightmare. The ""puzzles"" were a lesson in boredom. Seriously using your witcher sense to find clues was such an abysmal waste of time. Swimming sections were nothing but frustration. The difficulty scaling was terrible, mid game fights were often very difficult then suddenly a breeze at end game. The lore felt to me like a game of thrones wannabe, that's just a personal gripe if you are into that sort of genre you'd enjoy it more. Overall a huge living world with endless side quests, hiding a boring repetitve fetch quest filled gameplay experience.…"

The story, at least for me, was pretty boring and forgetful, the quest to find Ciri gets annoying real quick, and the formula is just: watch some cutscene and dialogues, fight some enemies, find some stuff, fight more enemies... and so on, the choice system is not much o relevant, at least on main quest, since the only choices that really matters are the ones that happens at when you're almost finishing it. For the positive side, i really like the sidequests and there is a lot of items to collect and things to do even after you beat the game, but i lost my save file so in order to pick the items i have to play that game again, and this won't be happening, at leasy by now.In conclusion i think that Witcher 3 has some great aspects, but it0 is incredible overhyped and i dont think it really deserves the praise.…"

One thing I hated while playing this on PlayStation 4 is that they had dulled the graphics down to a point where there was no point in making it about the graphics but they still pushed it to a point where it struggles to run on average PS4s. The fact that the game was constantly dipping into the 20 FPS range was not good and made a mediocre game even worse. Let's see, the universe is all right. The story is absolutely dog **** and confusing but if you ignore it and look around at the universe then that's the enjoyable part. The story is just so bland there's no point in praising it. The story is just an excuse for the horrible gameplay. Go here because A said so. Well B isn't where A said he was better find him. Oh C told me B is over at D. Turns out B isn't at D better find B. That's the level of depth we're talking about here. The actual gameplay is super boring. It's slow, clunky, and a mixture of too easy and hard. I was able to beat a boss standing still with my thumb on one button but as soon as I see a level 1 dog I'm dead because it just runs by and attacks me similar to an AoE attack without slowing down. Geralt is too slow to do anything. Buy the game to say you played it but save the reciept.…"

During cloudy weather you will be able to see clouds moving in the sky & shooting stars at night.Game have excellently implemented dynamic weather cycle, day and night cycle as you will see a dramatic difference between day and night life.Visuals :Graphically game is stunning and even more gorgeous after the latest patch.

Other examples are :- On Skellige : Gedyneith (Name Of Place) there is A House Under A tree when you visit that place for the 1st time you will see a dude plowing in soil but when you go there later you will see plants. You will see many changes in dandelions inn & main hall in Kaer Trolde castle throughout the game.Combat :Combat is enjoyable, addictive, tactical and superb both ways offensive & defensive. AI is intelligent & will use various defensive measures. Despite high level enemies you still can defeat them with tactics & patience.Other than basic close combat and ranged weapon, there are bombs & sign abilities (Basically Magic). You can use your ability points on skills but will choose wisely b/z you cant acquire them all as it is an RPG With choices & consequences, But you can reset them with potion.Other activities :Beside side quests there are witcher contracts and treasure hunting, you can also participate in horse racing, boxing & playing cards. The card game is also very fun & extremely addictive.Replayability :I doubt that some one will play this game once as of the colossal dialogue choices.

Tho I mostly enjoyed it for its characters and its story. The gameplay was still pretty rough (still a HUGE improvement from The Witcher) and many mechanics were rough too. The Witcher 3 refines everything you know and love about this franchise.The story and characters in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt are amazing. A side quest-line can be deeper and more meaningful than the main story of many other AAA titles out there. The ways characters interact with you and other NPCs is great and you really feel immersed in the world of The Witcher. The voiceovers are also really good and give life to these characters.The World is huge in this game and the locals so diverse. From swamps, to mountains, to grassy fields, to big cities, everything in The Witcher is fun to explore. The game is breathtakingly beautiful.Gameplay has been upgraded tremendously from the previous games and is a joy to play. Fighting and signs mechanics were improved and much easier to use. At the time I write this review, the menus have been re-hauled making everything much better from a UI standpoint.The only negative point I can give the game is the horse mechanics. Horse controls can be very frustrating at times. I've ended up just jumping off the horse and running quite a few times. Yet, that is not enough for me to give this game less than a 10.I'm also not counting the paid DLC in this review (tho I have played both and highly recommend them).This is my Game of the Decade!

I found the beauty of this game to lie, most of the time, in its great side quests rather than the main story. Some amazing characters populate this game’s world, and some side missions will highlight amazing storyline that unfortunately, seem to end all too quickly due to their nature of being just side quests.Like many other overrated titles to come out in recent memory (like The last of us and Horizon Zero Dawn) I found myself disappointed with The Witcher 3 all throughout its uninteresting story. There are definitely better games on the market, and if you’re looking for a deep action rpg experience, I would honestly look elsewhere.…"

DONT PLACE THIS **** IN CONSOLE REVIEVS SECTION....Graphics and atmosphere of Poland just pours out of the screen.

10,"After experiencing Witcher 2 on the Xbox 360 I was hesitant to jump back into the world of Geralt of Rivea.

I wasn't the biggest fan of the combat at the time and felt that the multiple aspects had a hard time transitioning to the console. However after having a drought in games to play I decided to jump into Witcher 3 a few months after launch, and it was the biggest mistake I could have made because I should have got it on Day 1. Even before inserting the disc into the game I was greeted with an insert from the developer thanking me for giving there a game a chance by purchasing it. Never before have I as a consumer, in any form of entertainment or product, felt that the people who worked on something truly valued the support I was giving them. But back to the game itself. For whatever reason I decided to play the game on the hardest difficulty, which I completely recommend of anyone whose played any open world game or rpg like Skyrim or Red Dead, and was pretty much stopped in my tracks by any horde of enemies. However the most pleasure from this game is in the preparation required to defeat enemies using such as signs, potions and oils to defeat enemies. Overcoming a hard boss that you've prepared for or finishing a long string of quests to unfold more of the story in Witcher 3 brings more excitement then I've ever felt for a game before, and that's because of the incredibly detailed open world rivaling the likes of The Elder Scrolls and Grand Theft Auto. Even the mini game of Gwent has become a phenomenon in itself and I feel heavily compelled to play every npc in this card game just so i can get access to new rare cards, an online component would have been amazing, but a separate game such as on the app store, the PlayStation store or Xbox marketplace would be an instant purchase for me. The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt is a 10 out of 10 for me, its a beautifully detailed open world rpg that deserves a look.…"

The graphics are superb I've never seen a game that made me be proud I have a nextgen system as much as this game did. The voice acting is pretty good (it took me a bit to get over geralt sounding like batman though). The body languange and facial expressions are what make interacting with people so good though. Sometimes I felt like I was watching a movie instead of playing a game.This game has some serious glitches though an elusive gwent card glitch make it nearly impossible to get the ""collect em all trophy"" making a platinum sometimes completely impossible. There is quest where you get locked into a dungeon and seriously your only way out is using a different glitch. The horse mechanics are kinda clunky. Sometimes I sheathe my sword in the middle of battle which can get really frustrating. This happens a lot when I'm fighting humanoid creatures like dongs and monsters at the same time and have to switch between swords. Well sometimes I sheathe one and never pull out the other. I've had quests that don't complete the way they should too.That being said this game is freaking so fun. I absolutely loved the gwent side game what a blast. I wish fallout 4 were half as good as this game..... or if walmart had a better return policy on video games but thats for a different rant. If you haven't played this game  you need to it's the most enjoyable single player experience I've had on a nextgen console. Lastly you can't go wrong when you put in a pair (or a hundred) of real ta tas lol. Honestly this title must have put the ESRB through the ringer.

Not the meaningless **** decisions that have zero effect on the game world you will find in Bethesda's Fallout 4.Consider this, I have not played any previous Witcher games, and I have no idea what a Witcher even was before playing this game. However it completely drew me in. I couldn't stop playing. I think I've put in more than 50-60 hours playing at a leisurely pace, and finished the main story and all the main side quests. Yet I have explore only 25-30% of the OPEN world portion of the game. There are VAST forests and caverns with interesting, useful loot, and monsters roaming the wilds that I have yet to kill.I cannot say enough good things about this game.

The Witcher 3 has become an example of what open world RPG's should be like. There isn't one section of land in this game which feels like it's been copied and pasted from somewhere else, or rushed together. The buildings, towns and cities have been built into the landscape, but gives you the feel of being transported into another world, which strangley feels real (even though you're fighting Griffins and casting magical signs!). I loved every second of The Witcher 3 and even though I was sad to come to the end of the main story, I quickly realised I still had much more to do. The only small negative I have is that I felt like I was leveling too quickly towards the end of the game, which made me feel a bit over powed, even though I was at the recommended level for that particular quest and I also felt that the inventory screen could've been better thought out (even after the patch which changed this screen). Overall, I love The Witcher 3 and I'll be playing it for a long time.…"

This weekend, after being disgusted with the amount of critical acclaim the Witcher achieved over Fallout 4, I decided to do intense research and practice with the game and I will say it is incredible. Better than Fallout 4 in nearly every aspect.Writing: Honestly one of the best quests I have ever played. The writing is fantastic, the quests are fun, emotional, and somtimes, funny. The characters are also quite good. I love the personalities in particular of Geralt and the Baron.Graphical: The graphics are nice. Water is very well done. The lighting and environment is very nice. Nothing unique per se, just realistic medieval and wilderness graphics. The monsters and armors are very creative; some look cool as **** (Wild Hunt Armor), and some look downright disgusting (Rotfiends, Botchlings).Technical: The game runs at 1080p, 30 FPS on the PS4, typical with many console games. The combat is decent, the only really bad thing I have to say, but it is still quite good. It requires strategy rather than hacking the **** out of someone as say the Elder Scrolls. Movement can be a bit sticky too, I've accidentally fallen off of ledges quite a bit.Overall: So damn good.

Yet, with The Witcher 3, developer CD Projekt Red proves that it's still possible to have a seriously amazing experience without necessarily innovating the genre's tried-and-true foundations.The game puts you on the shoes of Geralt of Rivia, a witcher (monster hunter) who roams the Northern Realms in search of Cirilla, his foster daughter, who is being chased by a supernatural army called the Wild Hunt. Having not played any of the previous titles, I found myself initially intimidated by the storyline background; luckily, the game's tale is written in such a way that you can mostly ignore the finer details of Geralt's previous sagas if you want to.The story itself is likely to please fantasy fans. It is a fittingly epic tale which uses the invasion of the Northern Realms by the southern Nildgaardian empire as a background, and it's reasonably fun and interesting. It does have its fair share of clichés and at least a couple of significant dei ex-machina (I'm looking at you, Dudu the Doppler) that render it hard to be taken entirely seriously as a piece of adult-oriented storytelling, however.In his adventure, Geralt roams several open spaces through the Northern Realms. The landscapes look absolutely gorgeous, filled with impressive lighting effects and extremely detailed textures. One of my favorite aspects of the setting is how it mixes traditional fantasy with a bit of horror, leading to some pretty scary enemies and scenarios, but without resorting to cheap jump-scares.There is a lot of ground to cover in the several open-world environments, with numerous towns, villages, sidequests and hidden secrets to keep you busy. Roaming the land in search of experience and loot is extremely satisfying, thanks in good part to the intuitive controls and the fluid action (no, there's not a single quick-time event to tell of, thank you very much). Like any good RPG, there are also extensive options to craft and/or buy gear, weapon, potions and assorted items, which manage to be intricate without getting overwheming.There is only one significant deviation from this formula: gwent, a simple strategy card game, played by Geralt and several NPCs, in which you amass an army (represented by separate character cards) and control the weather to defeat opponents. As basic as it is, it's a surprisingly addictive little diversion, and sometimes I found myself setting the main adventure aside just to wind off against NPCs and win new cards.Basically, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt plays brilliantly, looks gorgeous, and offers dozens upon dozens of hours for you to lose yourself in its very appealing brand of horror-tinged fantasy. With its compelling world, an equipment/potion/addon system that is deep yet easy to grasp, and a set of main quest missions that doesn't try to break its own boundaries in annoying ways, you have one of the best releases of the year for fans of epic adventures.Rating: 9.0…"

Everything is interactive, and it all looks so beautiful.The storyline is simple, yet it definitely gets your attention. I geniually care about Geralt and Ciri and most of the other supporting characters. I thought Tess and Zoltan were both great.The controls take a while to get a hold of but that's a good thing. I don't want to just smash the x-button the entire time I play a game. The witcher, and the many different villains that you fight require you to constantly change up your strategy in combat. I like that. Makes it interesting. Keeps it from getting stale.i love the different types of quests in the game. Some of the Witcher contracts have a nice sense of horror to them. Then there are some (the threesome quest) that have some funny moments to them.Gwent is one of the best in-game games I've ever experienced. You can literally just play that game for hundreds of hours.If you are a gamer, I would definitely suggest to play this on the hardest level. I played on normal and it was too easy so i went back and put the difficulty alll of the way up, and it was a much more challenging experience but made me feel much more satisfied.lastly, without giving too much away, Ciri is one of my favorite characters of all-time. Like Ellie from the Last of Us, I truly started to get emotionally attached to Ciri. I wanted her to be happy and I'm glad that I got the Witcher ending. I would have felt really empty had I thought Ciri died. I would be willing to play the entire game as Ciri btw, who is very fun to use in combat.This was the best game of the year.  A true masterpiece. I really need a Witcher 4 in my life…"

You control nothing, you simply play your part and that is amazing.…"

It's world and lore very rich in detail and so beautiful that I usually stop to admire the landscapes - something I rarely do in games. The maps are very big, with tons of Witcher activities to carry out, and alive too with monsters in habitats and humans in villages, that actually sometimes collide, resulting in the deaths of entire villages. Gameplay relies on you, the player's knowledge of how, and when monsters attack, what their weaknesses are, and what tools to use. Basically it's a role-playing game that gets the job of role-playing done - where you, the player, are put into the role of Geralt of Rivia. You are made to try to think like him, immerse yourself in the character, and be him. All the while, maybe adding a bit of your personality to him, to decide what's right or wrong in the game. Choices also actually affect how the game ends. It's the first game to actually get me somewhat teary eyed in the ending.Also, don't mind those people who complained that the PC version took a hit in the graphical area. The graphics are still beautiful and PC people are just-- ugh.All in all, this game is a great end to Geralt of Rivia's story. Get it when you can.…"

This incredibly beautiful open world is fantastically presented and I found myself frequently making use of the ps4's share button to uploadThe Witcher 3 is set in a fantasy medieval land with the Nilfgaard army invading the land, playing as Geralt you must find your one time ward Ciri and defeat the Wild Hunt, a group of elves from a different dimension trying to capture Ciri. This incredibly beautiful open world is fantastically presented and I found myself frequently making use of the ps4's share button to upload screenshots of the incredible scenery. The main storyline is one to be remembered for years as it keeps you interested at all times and is very easy to follow, even allowing you to make your own decisions in order to change the outcome of the game as well as causing changes to specific characters and even communities. If you weren't told otherwise, you'd think side quests were a part of the main story, with some side quests significantly affecting what happens to some characters, such as who will be the king/queen of Skellige or what will happen to King Radovid. Scavenger hunts and witcher contracts provide a nice alternative to the main story for a bit of money or to help level up your character. CD Projekt RED clearly didn't become lazy when creating side quests as they are excellent. One of the amazing things that CD Projekt RED did was allow new players (such as myself) to fully understand the lore of the game and the background of the characters despite the fact that this is the third game in its series. As is almost a requirement for any RPG game is a good combat system, and The Witcher 3 does not disappoint, simple fast attacks and heavy attacks make up the general swordplay but the use of rolls, dodges and parries allow for a more complex defensive part of combat and the addition of magic elements such as bombs, oils, potions and signs fulfills the RPG aspect of the game. General enemies are simple to take down, yet not at all repetitive and the boss battles are something else, huge elves known as the Wild Hunt make up the main bosses, wearing badass armour and having a huge amount of health combined with unique abilities such as teleporting or summoning elementals keep you on your toes and alert at all times make for some of the best boss fights I've ever seen. Sticking with the subject, the end battle is magnificent with not one but two bosses and the combination of fighting as both Ciri and Geralt adds an original twist to the already spectacular game. The only things that could be altered with this game are the occasionally glitchy movement system, often you'll find yourself unable to open a chest or loot a body and the walking and running can sometimes feel unnatural. As well as this, as somewhat of a newcomer to RPGs, at the beginning of the game I found it slightly difficult to fully understand some elements of the game such as magic items and the ability trees and so would recommend taking your time at the beginning to make sure you read the tutorials and completely understand them. In conclusion, this game completely amazed me, the incredible amount of content that is in this game is phenomenal and every aspect can't be faulted. It is definitely one of the best, if not the best game I have ever played and I would highly recommend it to anyone. The lack of multiplayer may deter some gamers however anyone will enjoy The Witcher 3, regardless of whether they usually prefer multiplayer or singleplayer. I have given The Witcher 3 a score of 10 because of the following reasons:Strengths:- Fantastic storyline- Impressive graphics- Interesting, exciting side quests- Highly entertaining boss battles- Good combat systemWeaknesses:- Occasional glitches- Unnatural movement…"
