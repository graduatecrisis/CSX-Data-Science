"Time","100","The holy grail of world-building games, it’s argued, is a black box that lets players do as they like with minimal handholding. Pliability with just the right measure of accountability. Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, a tactical stealth simulation wrapped in a colossal resource management puzzle inside a love letter to theatrical inscrutability, comes the closest of any game I’ve yet played to realizing that ideal."
"Playstation Official Magazine Australia","100","Gorgeous. Massively replayable. Packed with an addictive Mother Base meta game. Even if you aren’t a legacy fan, you’ll enjoy this spectacular send off to the series. [December 2015, p64]"
"LEVEL (Czech Republic)","100","Perfect, nearly tear-jerking, Kojima’s farewell with the series is a one big thank you to players and fans of the series. I shake my head in disbelief that Kojima was able to top himself again and surprisingly brought a game of the year players will talk about for a long, long time. [Issue#256]"
"GamesRadar+","100","A new standard for open-world interaction, and an incredible sign-off to a spectacular, often infuriating, series. This is one of the most ingenious, lovingly crafted games of all time."
"Digitally Downloaded","100","What you are getting with Metal Gear Solid V is hours upon hours of the vision of one of the most creative and artistic directors in video game history."
"Games.cz","100","Hideo Kojima says goodbye to almost thirty years of work on his series in the best possible way. Phantom Pain surprises and tightens, impresses and even torments, but primarily entertains beyond all expectations. It is everything that the stealth game in an open world can be and demands the maximum effort and participation from the players."
"Giant Bomb","100","Maybe the most impressive thing about this already very impressive game is just how damn weird it is. MGSV is bursting with the kinds of bizarre little touches this series is known for but which you never see in the biggest games that cost tens of millions and take years to create, especially the ones in this genre."
"We Got This Covered","100","Though diehard fans intent on playing the same old Metal Gear may be upset with a few of the changes here, Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain stands as a crowning achievement for Kojima and one of this console generation's best games."
"games(TM)","100","It would be ludicrous to assume Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain will appeal to everyone, but it is absolutely the best game in the series – and one of the best games we’ve ever had the privilege of playing."
"AusGamers","100","I don't know if MGSVTPP is the best game ever, but it's certainly the greatest. It's too large in scope and design to inspire anything other than awe -- even Metal Gear haters can surely appreciate the majesty of the game."
"Digital Spy","100","Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain is the apex of the series and a fitting way for Kojima et al to bow out: as one, as best, as Big Boss."
"LevelUp","100","Massive, complex, challenging, deep, ambitious and innovative, Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is more than a mere video game, it's a life devoted to the medium. A game for the ages."
"LaPS4","100","Dear Kojima, thanks for giving us this sophisticated engineering machinery. Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is simply a revolutionary product and probably the best stealth game in recent years. It's not afraid of the sandbox genre, it draws a vast and open field full of hours of gameplay, freedom, unlimited fun and a constant desire to know what will happen next. Kojima, you are the real Big Boss."
"Cheat Code Central","100","It’s a shame that this will be Kojima’s last MGS game, but for what it’s worth he set aside whatever ill feelings he might have against Konami to create one of his most ambitious games yet. Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is the best entry in the franchise."
"Atomix","100","Great, ambitious, funny and spontaneous, Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain will surely teach a thing or two to every developer in modern gaming."
"PlayStation LifeStyle","100","Incredibly, unbelievably, what we have here is a nearly perfect finale to the Metal Gear franchise. I truly believe that The Phantom Pain is where Kojima always envisioned he would take the franchise. This is personalized, open-world infiltration at its finest."
"Meristation","100","Metal Gear Solid V will transcend videogame history as the best episode in the series; packed with tons of contents, a mature and dark tone, memorable characters, villains and final bosses, intense missions and packed with surprises. The Phantom Pain is Hideo Kojima's ultimate tribute to Metal Gear. A Hideo Kojima Game."
"Gameblog.fr","100","Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is not a game like any other. The kind of game that respects the intelligence of players, with almost complete freedom, without visible guide. Both giddy and capricious, he carried on his shoulders the heavy responsibility to end the saga. In addition to profoundly redefining the infiltration genre and changing its type of narration, it offers the best gameplay in the saga. At the time of the conclusion, more subtle and direct as usual, Hideo Kojima was able to speak to the players, and most importantly leave a unique legacy in the history of gaming. The kind of eternal diamond that will accompany you throughout your life as a gamer. Big Boss, thank you for this last trip."
"Telegraph","100","Perhaps MGSV’s best quality is how in pulling gameplay to the foreground and letting much of the exposition remain optional, it opens it up to be enjoyed by people who have in the past been put off by its weirdness, serving as both the perfect entry point and a satisfying conclusion. MGSV takes the best of a great series and creates a series’ best in the process."
"God is a Geek","100","This isn’t just the best Metal Gear game, nor is it just the best stealth game, it is one of the best games ever made."
"3DJuegos","100","Kojima redefines the stealth-action genre showing a V for Victory. Good decisions, clear direction, deep gameplay, extremely polished... MGSV writes one of the most important chapters in the Metal Gear franchise."
"GameSpot","100","There has never been a game in the series with such depth to its gameplay, or so much volume in content. The best elements from the past games are here, and the new open-world gameplay adds more to love on top. When it comes to storytelling, there has never been a Metal Gear game that's so consistent in tone, daring in subject matter, and so captivating in presentation. The Phantom Pain may be a contender for one of the best action games ever made, but is undoubtedly the best Metal Gear game there is."
"IGN","100","There have certainly been sandbox action games that have given me a bigger world to roam, or more little icons to chase on my minimap, but none have pushed me to plan, adapt, and improvise the way this one does. Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain doesn’t just respect my intelligence as a player, it expects it of me, putting it in league that few others occupy."
"Vandal","98","MGS V: TPP is one of the best games we've ever played. No matter how high you're expectations are, it will go way beyond them. This is Kojima's masterpiece, and the worst thing about it is that it might be the last MGS with Kojima."
"Power Unlimited","97","Kojima's last addition to his legendary Metal Gear franchise is the greatest game he's ever produced. An undeniable pinnacle of the franchise and for video games in general."
"IGN Italia","97","The Phantom Pain is an incredibly polished and powerful experience. Kojima has gone 'all in' in the last chapter of his saga, and it paid off."
"Hobby Consolas","97","The Phantom Pain is the Divine Comedy of videogames, the best stealth adventure to date and the GOTY 2015. A true masterpiece and a perfect farewell for the man who sold the world: Hideo Kojima."
"XGN","96","Metal Gear Solid V is the perfect evolution of the Metal Gear Solid franchise. The amount of freedom, customization and the FOX Engine are close to perfection. One of the best stealth games ever made."
"GameOver.gr","95","Is this truly Hideo Kojima's last game in the legendary MGS franchise? If so he will be sorely missed because this epic conclusion to the Metal Gear saga is a true video gaming masterpiece."
"PSX-Sense.nl","95","This. This is how you make sure the final chapter of a franchise delivers. A truly epic masterpiece, Metal Gear Solid V is Hideo Kojima signing off the only way he knows how: in style."
"Post Arcade (National Post)","95","The real story is the one you make yourself as you play through each mission, making new decisions each time and writing an action thriller of your own making. That’s what makes Metal Gear Solid V brilliant, and that’s why people will still be talking about it years from now."
"GamingTrend","95","The Phantom Pain strays from the formula to perfect a new one, offering the best in open-world emergent gameplay we’ve seen this generation. While the story sometimes falters under expectations, the characters, aesthetic, and polish of this game set it apart as one of the year’s best."
"COGconnected","95","Phantom Pain is a game you can sink over 100 hours into and still come back for more. Even if you haven’t played past Metal Gear games, Phantom Pain is a great place to start."
"Arcade Sushi","95","Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain might not be the perfect game, but it's as close as any title has ever gotten."
"InsideGamer.nl","95","Storywise we are not loving Metal Gear Solid 5, but we tend to forget about it when we play through tens of hours of challenging gameplay. This legend ends with a bang; Snake has never had so much freedom in such an immense world that keeps on surprising."
"JeuxActu","95","A punch in the face, a huge gaming experience, a title with a nearly perfect gameplay and an adapted story-telling, eye candy and above all a wonderful Metal Gear: this fifth installment is a little bit of all that."
"Playstation Universe","95","A compelling, sprawling and often jaw-dropping experience that truly brings the franchise into the open-world setting for the first time."
"IGN Spain","95","The most complete chapter on the Metal Gear Solid franchise. A deep and complete experience capable of providing a ton of hours of joy. Maybe it's plot is lighter than usual for a MGS, but that's a minor flaw on a masterly sea."
"EGM","95","Big Boss’ supposedly final outing puts players in the middle of the most ambitious entry in the series yet, and it delivers on almost everything it promises. If this is Hideo Kojima’s final game, then he is stepping out at the top floor of the industry."
"PSX Extreme","94","Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is the masterpiece we all hoped it’d be. It’s undoubtedly the best game of 2015 and the generation so far and further solidifies Hideo Kojima as a master of the genre."
"Worth Playing","93","Metal Gear Solid V: Phantom Pain is a phenomenal game. It is a credit to its quality that some rather substantial flaws do little to drag down the game, and even with them, it's destined to be remembered as one of the best titles this year."
"GameTrailers","93","The Phantom Pain is excellent. It expands and enriches Metal Gear Solid without compromising the qualities that make the series so beloved. Despite the huge scope, Hollywood talent, and technical flashiness, there’s a subtlety to the Phantom Pain that’s truly captured our hearts. Even now we’re still turning its events over and over again in our minds. So rarely do game stories demand so much consideration. Decades later, it’s incredible that Metal Gear can still captivate, inspire, and amaze."
"Game Informer","93","A series can’t survive this long without evolving, and The Phantom Pain is a testament to the importance of taking risks. An open world, a customizable base, a variable mission structure – these are not traditional aspects of Metal Gear, but they are what makes The Phantom Pain such an exceptional game."
"Critical Hit","92","The Phantom Pain is an unusual Metal Gear experience, one that not everybody may enjoy if they cling to systems of old. If they’re willing to adapt and accept this new way of exploring Kojima’s world however, they are going to be blown away, absolutely, and one hundred percent guaranteed. This new open world is one that is begging to be played with, in whatever way a player wishes."
"Pelit (Finland)","91","There’s no denying the Game of the Year potential of The Phantom Pain. The campaign is absolutely massive, it’s almost too much to cope. That being said, Chapter II is a huge let-down and feels like artificial padding. Still, this is about as good as tactical espionage operations can get in a video game. [Oct 2015]"
"Games Master UK","91","Maybe not the finest Metal Gear, but certainly one of the finest games of this generation. [Oct 2015, p.60]"
"ActionTrip","91","If Kojima wanted to end his time with Metal Gear on a high note, he certainly pulled it off with Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain. Nice work indeed."
"Polygon","90","If this is where Kojima does finally leave the series he created, it will be a bittersweet send-off, both for Big Boss and one of gaming's most intriguing auteurs."
"SpazioGames","90","It's a game that subverts the basics of the Metal Gear Series. It's brilliant, unpredictable, gigantic, ambitious, awe-inspiring, vain and imperfect. This game is Kojima, basically, and it really reaches incredible heights during its first half. The second part, though, has obvious structural problems, and the narrative never really reaches the levels of the best chapter in the saga, even if the final plot twist is pretty brilliant. This Metal Gear will divide the fanbase, maybe even more than the second Metal Gear Solid, but it remains an amazing game."
"CD-Action","90","Kojima finally found the reasonable balance between gameplay and storytelling. The Phantom Pain is a game like no other and I would love to find a way to experience it for the first time again. [10/2015, p.44]"
"Level7.nu","90","By taking a step away from hours of cutscenes and codec conversation,and instead focusing on pure gameplay, Metal Gear Solid V is anunfamiliar but ultimately great and lengthy experience. It would havebeen nice with some more time spent on the characters and story, butit is a fair compromise with the new open world direction. Metal GearSolid V is a great evolution for the series and it is a shame that thenew direction will not reach its full potential due to Konami'sprobable withdrawal from the console world."
"PLAY! Zine","90","If you compare it to the previous installments you might feel disappointed. If you compare it to the rest of the gaming industry, then you’ll experience the ingenious excellence. The mixed feelings between an unfinished story and premium gameplay fail to ruin the greatness of what The Phantom Pain really is. But you won’t be able to shake off the regret of great not being even greater."
"Play UK","90","Mechanically superb, amazing to look at and offering as much MGS nonsense as players wish to indulge in. The Phantom Pain is everything we hoped it would be. [Issue#261, p.63]"
"VideoGamer","90","Still, I'm confident in calling Metal Gear Solid 5 the best game of the year, a vast undertaking where Kojima's reach hasn't exceeded his grasp, a game where a big story doesn't happen to you. Instead, you happen to it, slowly but surely. You may be surprised who you end up becoming."
"Gameplanet","90","If this is indeed the final Metal Gear title from Hideo Kojima, he's gone out on an impeccably-produced high. Although the story doesn't match that of past games, The Phantom Pain's gameplay delivers in a way that only a select few open world games manage."
"DarkStation","90","Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is the culmination of decades of an acclaimed series that repeatedly raised the bar with every entry. The storytelling may not please everyone, especially the initiated, but this is unquestionably the best gameplay in a Metal Gear game."
"Edge Magazine","90","Its finest tactical espionage action yet. [Oct 2015, p.104]"
"Brash Games","90","Kojima Production’s have created their magnum opus. A gem that has truly evolved the design of open world action."
"GamesBeat","90","As a game, The Phantom Pain excels. The stealth and action work beautifully in the open-world setting, and maintaining your Mother Base gives you plenty of rewards. It’s long, fun, and gives players tons of variety. I just wish that the story offered more."
"Push Square","90","In terms of its story, the fifth instalment in the series may leave some fans wanting more, but overall, the release proves to be a fitting, brutally brilliant finale to Hideo Kojima's beloved saga."
"TheSixthAxis","90","Kojima has also done an excellent job of integrating this story into the well worn universe, wrapping up almost all of the loose ends within, as well as tying it to the events that are set to follow in a way that ought to please fans."
"GRYOnline.pl","90","You can be sad about some things in The Phantom Pain but everything becomes irrelevant in confrontation with superb gameplay and immense layers of freedom. Metal Gear Solid V is the most complex stealth game in history, one you can't ignore. What is more, the entry threshold is pretty low and MGS V should be very interesting even to those players that aren't familiar with the universe. Remember - it's a great stealth game but not a great MGS game."
"Eurogamer Poland","90","Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain impresses at every turn. It's a vast and addictive game that manages to surprise even after many hours. Few minor bugs and repeatability are the only drawbacks. The final Metal Gear from Kojima is definitely worth recommending."
"Game Rant","90","The game is a triumph in more ways than one, and while it’s not without flaws, it’s safe to say that Hideo Kojima and company have successfully adapted the core of Metal Gear Solid for an open world."
"Gamer.nl","90","This game is a painful goodbye for the series. In many ways this is the best Metal Gear game thus far, with unique details, multiple ways of succeeding in missions and nearly perfect stealth gameplay. But, the story is messy and it feels unfinished."
"The Jimquisition","90","I’ve not had this much raw fun with a game in quite some time. It could have ditched the plot entirely and just thrown me into these environments with all the unique toys and I’d have had a roaring good time. This is, to date, Kojima Productions’ finest videogame if we’re looking at it as a piece of pure, unabashed entertainment."
"Game Revolution","90","To everyone who grew up with Metal Gear Solid, especially the ones who bought Zone of the Enders for the Metal Gear Solid 2 demo, Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is an experience that will never be forgotten. While it is sad that we may never see another Metal Gear with Kojima's vision, he gave us one hell of a goodbye. Thank you, Big Boss."
"Hardcore Gamer","90","It contains not only some of the best combat mechanics available, but everything you could have wanted from a Metal Gear Solid game. Plus Kiefer Sutherland."
"USgamer","90","Metal Gear Solid 5 overstays its welcome a bit in the back half of the story, and F.O.Bs aren't much more than a fun novelty, but otherwise it's a stunningly enjoyable game that almost perfectly integrates a sizable open world environment with solid stealth fundamentals and a huge arsenal."
"Metro GameCentral","90","The best Metal Gear Solid game ever made, as it bravely reinvents both its gameplay and its storytelling to far greater effect than ever before."
"Everyeye.it","90","If this is really the last Metal Gear Solid, it's an appropriate farewell. The story might be really slow to unfold, but there's a freshness in the gameplay that can appeal to newcomers as well."
"Eurogamer Italy","90","With a solid gameplay, an expanded version of the Mother Base and the powerful FOX Engine, Metal Gear Solid V delivers what it promised in a generation full of disappointing games and sequels. Despite a confusing story, The Phantom Pain is great game for everybody and a must-have for Kojima's fans."
"Destructoid","90","Despite the fact that I hit a few snags along the way, Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain feels like a simultaneous celebration of the series, and a decidedly new chapter. It's equal parts tough and flashy, and it's fitting that if this is Kojima's last Metal Gear, he goes on a high note."
"NZGamer","89","It feels like this was the game Kojima knew he should have reluctantly made from the beginning - having finally kicked the habit of falling into cinematic gluttony to tell his stories. He’s made a game that utilises more fully what a game should, with all the learning curves that come with trying something new. Metal Gear Solid 5 is the best stealth game I’ve ever played, it’s just not the best open-world one."
"GamesVillage.it","89","The Phantom Pain is an excellent title, albeit a little bit inconsistent. The gameplay is simply extraordinary, almost perfect, deep and bound to pave the road for the future of the stealth genre; at the same time, the plot is very powerful, but could have definitely been bolder and braver. Well, it's pretty clear that something went AWOL during the development of the game."
"Multiplayer.it","88","Quotation forthcoming."
"CGMagazine","85","Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is an exhilarating game to play that has massive narrative shortcomings."
"4Players.de","83","Even after the second finale questions are left open – questions that might not be answered after Hideo Kojima had to leave the franchise behind. But he also leaves an impressive piece of work as his legacy. It is not without flaws and the mission design relies a little too much on recycling. But the freedom you enjoy while on your missions is exemplary."
"Quarter to Three","80","Phantom Pain is a celebration of R-rated power fantasies and even a light sprinkling of grindhouse sex and violence, not the least bit inappropriate for a game with an M-rating. Here’s the only litmus test you need: if it’s good enough for movies, it’s good enough for videogames."
"New York Daily News","80","You won't quite walk away from this Metal Gear shocked by its story in the same way as you did from, say, Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater...But the sandbox remains so addictive and complete that you never may walk away from this Metal Gear at all."
"Twinfinite","80","It’s a technical marvel, and is undoubtedly one of the best stealth action games ever made."
"Dealspwn","80","The unfortunate truth is that its narrative fails to deliver a coherent and satisfying conclusion to the series, but as a stealth sandbox The Phantom Pain is peerless."
"Slant Magazine","80","It hardly matters that the game's mission objectives are redundant, given that the locations are so diverse and detailed...An impressive epic, even if it falls several steps shy of the open-world grandeur realized by The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt."
"Washington Post","80","This kind of tortured melodrama feels like the best possible ending for Kojima’s biggest failure. No matter how exciting, offensive, or incoherent some of his turns have been, there has always been something beautifully true to life in his willingness to try."
"Kill Screen","69","The Phantom Pain is different. It, like its predecessors, wants to remind the player that war is, indeed, hell. But, in giving over to structural bloat it obscures the tremendous promise established in its opening hours, trading the narrative power of violent anguish for a routine, Sisyphean take on torment."
"GameCritics","60","It's kind of insane that the spiritual follow up to Peace Walker and easily the most ambitious Metal Gear title to date somehow winds up as arguably the least interesting entry overall, but there it is."
