Year,Game,Review
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"Just overall the best game I've ever played, they've truly outdone themselves on this game. It is art and will always be known as one of the greatest rpgs ever created during this era of games. I can see my self easily putting 200-300 hours in Skyrim over the next few years until TES 6 is released."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,Simply the best game I have Ever played.  I have spent 3 Solid days in Skyrim and they have been some of the most beautiful most memorable gaming experiences I have had and I have barely scratched the surface.

I have spent 3 Solid days in Skyrim and they have been some of the most beautiful most memorable gaming experiences I have had and I have barely scratched the surface.  I concur with most of the reviewers here in saying I have No IDEA how anyone could give this a negative review.  There is just so many ways to play to many paths to take so many different ways to experience the game I don't think there is a way anyone couldn't find a entertaining way to venture forth in the world. I don't even know where to start with this game.  Everything about it is extraordinary Bethesda went above and beyond the call and have made The Best RPG world any game has ever seen.  Every environment is alive and every cave I have explored is unique. There are not enough good things to be said about this game.  Easy 10/10 if you have Any interest in games do yourself a BIG favor and pick this up ASAP\
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"Amazing! Exceeded all of my expectations, and all my friends expectations, and then some. The BEST Elder Scrolls--and open-world RPG--to date. Though I bought it for the 360 I also plan to purchase it for the PC at some point (something I'm not ashamed of), to take part in the excellent modding community."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"A masterpiece, is one of those games that make you think that video games can be considered an art, like painting, music or movies. It's a fantastic virtual experience, deep history, superb gameplay, beautiful graphics, majestic music, in short, an incredible journey for all people who love video games"

2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"This is simply an excellent game. I mean, it is a must have.  I can not stop playing it.  This game will probably cause me to fail calculus and chemistry and my girlfriend to break up with me.  But seriously, you should defiantly get this game."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"This is quite possibly the best game ever made!  70 hours into it and I'm still finding new things to do and the thing that really gets me is that of the over 300 dungeons in the game, none of the ones I've been to have been just re-skinned, they are all original!  Mad Props to Bethesda!!  Using my MW3 disc as a coaster to hold my beer!!!"

2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"An absolutely outstanding game! Not just one of the best RPGs of the year, but, one of the best RPGs every created. The best installment of the Elder Scrolls yet and the (highly) likely winner of numerous Game of the Year titles."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,Skyrim is an amazing game building on what Bethesda achieved with Fallout 3 and Oblivion to create a superb RPG with a good story so far anyway gizzilions of side quests and great graphics there are a few bugs but they don't damage the experience and will hopefully get patched if you are an RPG fan you need to get this game!!!!

2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"I have nearly 50000g and this is the best game I have ever played on any console period. It is also the best value for money too, if you can give this game your time it will reward you in so many ways. Not perfect, but a true to the word epic masterpiece."

2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"MW3 doesn't even compare to Skyrim.  Different games and different pros and cons.  I spent almost 300 hours on my perfect stat character in Oblivion, so I'm sure that the same thing will happen with Skyrim.

I'll know that i will be playing both Skyrim and MW3, but I will definitely have more fun with games like Darksouls and Skyrim over dealing with unskilled players in MW3 who are all talk.  Quick question, how can so many people who bought MW3 at midnight be so terrible at the game?  Played a team deathmatch game, i was 16-2, last 3 guys a combined 8-32...\"

Rather than funnelling you into doing the main quest, after a brief start, it sets you free to go and see and do whatever you want.

2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"Yesterday one of my friends on Xbox Live messeged me and asked ""so hows Skyrim?"".  I get a lot of messges about games and how they are and normally its no problem to respond, but when I came to reply there were no words.  I had been playing for 2 hours when the messege came and I was lost in The Elder Scrolls, this happened with Morrowind and Oblivion, but never like this.  I was a BosmerYesterday one of my friends on Xbox Live messeged me and asked ""so hows Skyrim?"".  I get a lot of messges about games and how they are and normally its no problem to respond, but when I came to reply there were no words.  I had been playing for 2 hours when the messege came and I was lost in The Elder Scrolls, this happened with Morrowind and Oblivion, but never like this.  I was a Bosmer (wood elf) , I was a scout sent by the Council of Mages at the Arcane University, I was Binwin the Swift.  I was completely engrossed as this sneaky archer hunting stags on the turndra of Skyrim.  In the end I replied with ""there are no words to describe this game but I will try, this is a game like a fine wine, not to be gulped and rushed but to be sipped and appreciated, to enjoy every hidden flavour and depth, this is a game to ruin your real life.""  Now I have finished with all that, I will try and be more specific, this is an RPG which really means it, this isnt a game where you are given a hero pre made, you make this hero, you know his or her past, you play that character how you want.  You choose the route you go, never being told, you cant go this way or that way.  You are surrounded by a world created by people whos love for this world pours from the game like a fine mead from a tankard into your dry mouth, and after one sip you need more .  You are surround by sounds and a score so epic nothing from the outside world can penetrate, including your wife telling you to get the plates out for dinner.  If you decide to buy this game in essence you are buying into a world, a journey to find epic dragons and a fantasy land which will see you through not weeks, not months but years of gameplay.  This is how RPG's were meant to be.\"
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,Great game
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"Just wanted to cancel Merrill4Life critic, which as always is full a **** Look at the user history and you will notice that this user always destroys everything competing against the DA2 debacle. His reviews are copy/pasted just to promote DA2, EA and Bioware, which has nothing to do with Skyrim, just like my review. But mine serves the purpose to cancel his."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"Open, grand, beautiful, rich and several other words have ebeen used to describe this game, and it is all true. A long awaited sequel, that delivers on every promise, which in it self is an achevement. Games like these are one in a billion."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"This is the best game i've ever played in my life.If you liked oblivion you'll adore this one; if you didn't play oblivion you must try Skyrim and lose yourself in tamriel's land...huge,wonderful, endless, beautiful, surely GOTY.Bethesda did it again..a Must buy"
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,This is the game to own this year. Skyrim could easily last you for a year. Bethesda ALWAYS do a fantastic job in their games. You may encounter a few glitches or weird IA behaviors but who cares? This is an amazing game that is released each 4-5 years. Bethesda knows nothing about milk cows!!
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"Easily beats any wRPG out there this decade.

The visuals areEasily beats any wRPG out there this decade. The character development is actually simpler than most Elder Scrolls games, streamlining everything you need and canning everything you don't. Also, it's implementation of a perk system similar to Fallout means that development of your character hasn't lost any depth and each character to every user is as unique as they are. The visuals are stunning and the vast, expansive environments, while sometimes barren, suggest a living, breathing world creating the perfect sense of verisimilitude. I wouldn't want every inch of a game-world to be populated by enemies and NPC's, it takes away from your suspension of disbelief and always reminds you with a shattering crash that you're playing a game. Sadly, this is often the case in Bioware RPGs but is in no way present here. Many people online are complaining about the use of Dragons in the game, saying it is unoriginal without obviously knowing that Dragons have been intergral to the polt since Elder Scrolls I: Arena. The first 4 games have all been leading up to the return of the Dragons and now that it's happened, expect every other Elder Scrolls to be as epic as this one is. The combat system is fluid and intuitive. You can go from being a beginner new to the series to slicing up some enemies while throwing fireballs at everything else with ease. It's available to casual gamers by not requiring micro-management and being a great game you can take at your own pace and the hardcore gamers by allowing amazing depth in both development and gameplay. The item/spell creation system has basically infinite possibilities and the game is so packed full of extras that perfectionists will probably do good to never play any game ever again if they hope to get absolutely everything there is to offer. One of the most anticipated RPG releases ever, and it's for great reason. The stroy is heavily focused on which is something games fail to do nowadays and it seems Bethesda recognise videogames as a legitimate story-telling medium rather than a cash-cow business (*cough*Activision*cough*) and don't rush their development, instead pouring heart and soul into a game and releasing when it is done. The quintessential wRPG, pick this game up now and feel euphoria.\"
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,Simply Epic in scope. Between this and BF3 my PC gaming is assured to be great throughout the end of 2011. Thank you for yet another masterpiece Bethesda!
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"A game so well made it gives me chills. The attention to detail is for my part never before seen in a videogame. I was very hyped for this game, and I was very surprised when Skyrim exceeded ALL of my expectations. 60$ for a game this scope; it's a real bargain."

2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"I'm so confused at all the people who wrote negative reviews.

I'd give it a 9.5/10 for some very minor bugs and some bad animations, but it really doesn't subtract from your experience all that much unless you care about graphics THAT MUCH.\"
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"Skyrim, If I could sum it up in one word it would be 'stunning'.

It is all up to you.PresentationSkyrim may not be the pinnacle in graphic evolution, but it looks breath-taking, theSkyrim, If I could sum it up in one word it would be 'stunning'. Skyrim has a rich constructed land filled with endless of hours of content, from fighting the major villains in the game, Dragons, to exploring dungeons in search of treasure, or fighting in the civil war. It is all up to you.PresentationSkyrim may not be the pinnacle in graphic evolution, but it looks breath-taking, the world and the characters have all been rendered brilliantly, and certainly pushes the xbox 360 graphically to it's limits. Trees move in the wind, fog rolls down the mountains, rivers run realistically and this is all heightened by the amazing sound.  However there may be the odd low texture, or bug here or there; but to be honest who doesn't expect the odd glitch here and there, especially when you are adventuring in a humongous word such as Skyrim. Games are never perfect, and I for one don't expect them to be, but the odd bug in here and there may be annoying, but it never ruins the experience.  Gameplay Skyrim's game play is one of the best I have seen. The detail to each quest and the main story itself is amazing, and I can vouch that you won't be stuck with nothing to do within this game for the coming months. Combat has been improved upon from Oblivion and each hit you can feel, and enemies stagger from each swipe. The magic system has also been re-vamped from Oblivion, such as dual-casting, to combining spells. All the dungeons and areas to explore feel unique, you can now marry on Skyrim, as well as hire or accept adventures to come with you. The Radiant AI and Radiant Story vary the locations and purpose of smaller quests, based on actions you have made. NPC'S react to certain events and the world feels more alive as a result. The 'motto' for the game 'You are what you play' certainly lives up to expectations, there are no pre-defined class choices, you level up based on what you use and do. For instance if you go around hacking and slashing with a two-handed mace, while wearing heavy armour, you are going to level up your two-handed and heavy armour levels. Or you may what to have a sword in one hand and a spell in the other, while wearing light armour, thus you will level up in those areas.The ScoreIf you liked Oblivion and Morrowind, you will be genuinely pleased with Skyrim, it improves on all aspects and personally smashed all my expectations. Yes some people might complain the graphics are not the best, or the AI may muck up a few times, but that is something you have to expect in all games, especially a game of this magnitude with over 300 hours of content to keep you busy, so your bound to run into the odd bug. Overall Skyrim is a beautiful game with deep lore and conflicts to keep you immersed into the world. Certainly a contender for Game Of The Year.\"

I have long awaited the release of this title, Skyrim, and have been slightly antsy that it would simply be too much more of the same.  Well, all I can say is that I have been blown away!  Skyrim has taken everything that was wrong with the previous titles and turned it around.  The days of spending hours trying to figure out how to level up your character are long gone.  Simply create your character and play.  It is as easy as that, really.  The graphics have been upgraded to an astounding level for the 360, and the character movements have become amazing!  The intro had me on the edge of my seat, and I couldn't stop playing after that.  The new system is perfectly blended with the old, yet has a new edge that pulls rookies and veterans into a new world of beauty and RPG-fun like no other role-playing out there.  Thank you Bethesda.  You have given me a reason to dive head first back into the world of video games again.\"

Then it's back to ""I took an arrow in the knee.""  The faction quests, with the possible exception of the Thieves' Guild, are similarly uninspiring.  Oh, and my wife in I have a sham marriage , in which I show up every week and she gives me gold.  I'd like to converse with her, but she can only say four lines of dialogue.  Bottom line:  maybe this is the price of a truly open world -- i.e., it's miles wide and an inch deep.  And to be fair, there's plenty of mindless fun to be had.  But I'd trade most all of these random dungeons and dragon/troll/mammoth battle royales for some sense that what I'm doing matters.  If it's an RPG, Bethesda, I want to play a role, not just be a roving bringer of destruction and taker of loot.\"

For as interesting a world Skyrim is to look at, the developers seemed fine filling it with repetitious, ""uninspired"" quests, given to you by countless amounts of npcs', none of which in possession of what I would call an actual personality. The gameplay, while serviceable, is rather unpolished and doesn't meet up to the standards set by other action games of today. Character development, not only weak, is rather unbalanced. The game rewards you for boosting skills you may have no interest in using, and the whole point of actually leveling your character seems trivial, being that enemies scale with you. Long story short, this is a rather flat experience. Sure, if you set your standards low, the sheer amount of content, as lackluster as the majority of it is, should last you a long, long while. Anyone looking for something thought-provoking and memorable, however, should look elsewhere. The game is a nice looking, yet very generic hack 'n' slash loot fest. If that is something that interests you, you will probably love this game. If you are looking for something more, this game should be avoided.\"
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"There is virtually no choice and consequence whatsoever. Quests rarely have any branching paths or variables that hold lasting effects according to your actions; indeed, as demonstrated by Skyrim and Oblivion beforehand, Bethesda fasely believes that ""role-playing"" amounts to little more than ""having alot of stuff to do."" Combat is incredibly flawed and was not improved upon over OblivionThere is virtually no choice and consequence whatsoever. Quests rarely have any branching paths or variables that hold lasting effects according to your actions; indeed, as demonstrated by Skyrim and Oblivion beforehand, Bethesda fasely believes that ""role-playing"" amounts to little more than ""having alot of stuff to do."" Combat is incredibly flawed and was not improved upon over Oblivion in the slightest; enemy A.I. is without any complexity or variation, and this, coupled with the lack of precision in attacks (""WOAH LOOK AT THAT CAMERA FLYING EVERYWHERE WHEN I SWING REALISTIC!!!111!!!11"") reduces battles to little more than mindless hack n' slash fests, with the only ""challenge"" in these battles being how well you can last out against objects with inflated stats (This isn't Skyward Sword, or Dark Souls, where you actually have to think and adapt your strategies accordingly to different battles; the only difference among Skyrim's foes, most of the time, is what numbers are attributed to each NPC).The leveling system is terrible and encourages mindless grinding. While ""practice makes perfect"" works in theory, you aren't actually practicing when you level your one-handed skill, for example; you're just repeatedly hacking and slashing to get higher points. This stands in opposition to games such as Dark Souls, where you are rewarded for tackling tough enemies that require thought to take down. In Skyrim, you are rewarded for doing nothing.On that note, level scaling is terrible. Early on, abilities seem to be balanced; there are fair benefits to going with either a melee or magic build. Later on, the system becomes incredibly broken, giving unfair advantages to melee builds and rendering casters useless.The animations are still hideous and robotic, and differ little, in quality, from Oblivion's (In fact, many of them seem to be ripped straight FROM Oblivion).Quests are poorly designed and feel like standard MMO fair (Which should be inexcusable in a game that is NOT an MMO); unfortunately, there is no hint of quality story-telling to mask this problem (It's as if Bethesda's writers spent a little too much time in the young adult literature section of the local library and came back believing they could write quality fantasy with compelling characters).While the overworld is nice and gives the illusion of complex design, dungeons are still cramped, narrow corridors without any nuance to their design. The environment itself should be a challenge; if there is no challenge present in the dungeons, it is pointless to include them.The game does feature quality music, and the visuals are pretty (Except when you get a little too close to a wall or the ground and realize how low-quality the textures can be), but that isn't enough to mask the game's mechanical flaws. Skyrim may be a great nature walk simulator, but it's a bad game.\"

2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"Simly put: the pros outweigh the cons. Biggest pro: Aesthetics. Biggest con: Magic Constrictions. Theres more if you're willing to read. I will start by saying my vote is based on a scale of 0-10, 0 meaning ""unplayable"", 5 equal to Oblivion (not inherently bad, just to compare Skyrim respectively), and 6+ is an overall improvement from Oblivion. Voice Acting (+1) has been greatly improvedSimly put: the pros outweigh the cons. Biggest pro: Aesthetics. Biggest con: Magic Constrictions. Theres more if you're willing to read. I will start by saying my vote is based on a scale of 0-10, 0 meaning ""unplayable"", 5 equal to Oblivion (not inherently bad, just to compare Skyrim respectively), and 6+ is an overall improvement from Oblivion. Voice Acting (+1) has been greatly improved from 12 to 70+ actors, meaning you can play longer before you are driven insane by the repetitive voice of Jauffre. Aesthetics (+2) are greatly improved over Oblivion. The map itself is slightly smaller than Oblivion, but it's designed to feel 4x bigger, and it does. Filled with flowing creeks, ice caps, mountains, snow, and A LOT more. Graphics (+1) are improved, not by much tho. It looks better, for sure, but that's thanks to the aesthetics. As for clarity and detail of models, it's only a slight, but noticeable improvement. Skills (+1) have a better setup. Many people like that the skills were directly related to your use of them like in Oblivion, but perks make the game feel more survival/strategic based. They're done nicely. Professions (+1) are a wonderful addition that are a tie between skills and aesthetics, but is prominent enought to be listed as its own plus. While the only real mechanical upside of professions relates to smithing, it's still wonderful to be able to chop wood, mine ores, smelt ores, and so on to improve your gear. Dragons (+0) are an interesting replacement to Oblivion Gates. That's exactly what they are, a replacement. While epic within the story line, and fun to battle with their random characteristics, they are also as repetitive as Oblivion Gates. No matter how epic they are, I find myself only wanting to kill them only for their souls, but after the first 10, it starts to get old. That's why it's a plus zero, cause they're epic, but repetitive. Number of Places (+1) have been increased by about double, and to top it off you never feel like you explore the same place twice, unlike Oblivion. Magic (-2) has been drastically reduced... I'm not sure the number of spells in either game, but I do know they REALLY trimmed magic. They completely did away with Mysticism, and got rid of the ability to craft spells. Bethesda combated the lack of spells with the ability to dual wield spells, but it's not enough... They dropped the ball on this one. User Interface (-1) has always been a core downside for Bethesda's most recent games, even on consoles. I would have not listed UI as a downside, however I hate that they replaced the D-Pad hotkeys with a pausable favorites menu. While it's nice at first, it really pulls you away from combat when all you want to do is unequip your shield and equip a spell. So, to summarize, Oblivion is a 5 on the scale (not inherently bad, just to compare Skyrim respectively), and the improvements include Voice Acting +1 (6), Aesthetics +2 (8), Graphics +1 (9), Skills +1 (10), Professions +1 (11), Dragons +0 (11), Places +1 (12), and the downsides: Magic -2 (10), and UI -1 (9), so overall Skyrim is a +4 compared to Oblivion.\"

The detail in the world, NPCs, dungeons and lore is all something very special.  It is a huge world to explore, with tangents aplenty.Minor pop in, low res textures and glitchy (very, very rarely) are the only flaws in my book.  Nothing can stop me from loving this world, and every time I jump back into exploring the lands of Skyrim it feels perfect.  Don't worry; Graphically, this game is ridiculous.  The beautiful vistas coupled with the achingly beautiful soundtrack is stunning...It's so hard to explain because games just don't do what Skyrim does anymore.And a side note...This game has a sprawling and downright ridiculous amount of things to do.  I won't spoil any of them for you, but don't worry.  You won't be short of things to do.  Forever, most likely.  It may not be everyone's cup of tea, But it's mine.

While I got a sense of satisfaction playing the speechcraft mini game in Oblivion to obtain better prices or information, its necessity caused it to be a time sink - I don't miss it.Interface is pleasingly minimal compared to Oblivion.  Main quests are separated from a ""Miscellaneous"" category which allows my sanity to stay in tact as I accumulate a pile of them in the first town of Whiterun.  Beyond that, every button (aside from the joysticks) can be remapped as you please.  Such a simple freedom, but sometimes makes all the difference.  The ""Favorite"" button follows the form of the interface being an easy way to quickly swap frequently used items.One gripe I do have is that poisons still seem too awkward to use regularly.  I'd really like to see a ""poison queue"" option so I could select concoctions to be automatically applied to whatever equipped weapon I was using at the time until the entire queue ran dry.  And perhaps even a little indicator to show when a new one had been auto-applied. Another problem I have is the inability to go beyond the ""follow"" and ""wait"" commands for companions. I would really like Passive/Aggressive/Defensive stances so that I don't have to do as much micromanagement.Now Skyrim is very much like Oblivion in many ways, but I think it's unfair to use this as leverage against it. I enjoyed Oblivion thoroughly even though I hardly made it halfway through the main quest line.  For the same reason, I have thoroughly enjoyed Skyrim so far as the immersion has been deeper for me.  Ultimately, an RPG does require some effort on the player's part to become part of the story - to be invested in their character.  This isn't a shooting gallery type of game where you're a track expecting to be entertained by cinematic pomp and circumstance that would make Michael Bay blush.  It's a role-playing game that does a fantastic job of urging you to be invested in your own story through its setting in a vibrant world and organic leveling system allowing you to choose your path as you progress rather than as a weighted decision at character creation. In short, suspend cynicism and enjoy this game with the patience you would give to a good book - it deserves it.\"

YES! FALLOUT WAS BASED ON OBLIVION, THE PREVIOUS GAME IN THE ELDER SCROLLS SERIES! seriously, get your facts right before you mouth off about how supposedly overhyped and bad this game is when it's clearly not. This is probably Bethesda's crown jewel. The game is awesome in almost every way: the gameplay, the story, the RPG elements, the sheer scale of the map in which you get to explore as you see fit right down to mundane things like buying a house and organizing books. Again, I'll repeat, I challenge ANYONE to fix bugs in a game this massive. And for those convincing themselves that the critics have been bribed by Bethesda, go choke on your on phallus. The game is outstanding in every sense of the word, get a grip or get lost.\"

The graphics is outdated though, we are looking towards 2012, and the graphics looks like from 2010, not saying it was bad but I guess its the lack of budget in creating a perfect game engine.Gameplay:Unbreakable pots, surroundings, coming from BF3, I'd actually would like to destroy stuff (not buildings) but I want to crack some rocks and pots, plates and glasses - but that opportunity is not available in Skyrim. You can't attack while mounting which is ridiculous, your companion doesn't ride with you when you are on your horse + your companion takes a different path you take which leads to him/her being left alone. These are the only ones that I didn't like the most, the rest are good.Sound:Better than before, but wouldn't hurt to have more. It's kinda boring hearing the same sound everytime. Maybe next time they should have different background music for every city, houses, and so on.Overall:The whole game is a bug, it feels like its a beta of an upcoming game from the producers. As of now, I've spent a 100 hours (>_> just being modest here, I spent more) meaning this game is totally worth your time. You can read books, farm, smith, become a cook, merchant, thief - the only thing here missing is to become a prostitute or a gigolo (which is coming up in their next game hopefully).Buy this game, don't rent it.

2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"Skyrim is the best RPG once could ever ask for, possibly even the best game one could ever ask for.

I simply cannot ask for a better game than Skyrim"
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,After spending hours of my life exploring in Oblivion I wondered if my thumbs could handle another trek of that kind. Well after a mere 8 hours with Skyrim I can safely say the gamble has paid off. Skyrim is a must have game for any gamer that loves an role play game. Pick this game up ASAP as you will not regret it!!

You have the chance to excel in becoming an archer, mage or a warrior, but it is entirely up to you on how skilled you become in either of these departments. Fancy like firing arrows at people from a long distance? You can do that. Fancy like using a combination of magic and melee to pray upon an unsuspecting opponent? You can do that too. Upon levelling up you can customise the paths you take in ANY skill; alchemy, pickpocketing and light armour to name but a few.If you have never played an Elder Scrolls game before, do not fret (or threat - whatever the correct term is)! Skyrim references back to its predecessors in a way that old-timers can connect and engage with, and newcomers can learn the ancient lore of the Elder Scrolls storyline.An absolutely outstanding game from an absolutely outstanding series!

2011,Batman: Arkham City,"I just downloaded this recently when it hit Xbox live market; I am already at 100% and working on the ""harder"" replay of the game you unlock.

I can see already that this game has very little replay value other than occasionally trolling around beating up thugs and fantasizing that I am, in reality, capable of being like Batman. As a fan of the character, I expect better.This game isn't terrible, and I can tell a lot of work went into it. However, it seems like they couldn't decide whether they were making a game for adults or for children, and tried to split hairs. It's like like they went half ""dark knight"" and half cartoony Batman... The story-writing and clever humor throughout the game are pretty good, but the combat mechanics are often unresponsive or too impractical; the camera angles make precise control difficult no matter what setting you use; the enemies take unrealistic amounts of damage. The game uses high health enemies and sheer numbers to make it ""hard"", and it feels stupid to be fighting a large crowd of ""common thugs"" who can apparently take 20 or 30 Batman punches before going night-night. (I understand the game wants you to master combos, but seriously?) Sometimes the game forces a certain action or gadget use when other more obvious routes should have been available to batman (having to use a zipline or remote control batarang by being prevented from gliding, grappling, swimming, climbing, or any other action Batman is normally capable of).Everything is hidden, even stupid simple objectives like payphones are deliberately placed in hard to reach spots so as to run down any timers associated with a mission. The supporting characters play very minor roles- why does Catwoman make more of an appearance than Robin? Why is Nightwing nowhere in the campaign? Why are there 50 thousand ridler trophies; all I know is if I find them all the Riddler had best show up as a secret fight or I will be angry.The biggest killer is that there is little to do at endgame other than to fight and collect trophies. The challenge modes are ok, but I would rather play Special Ops in that case if anyone knows what I am saying. It is too late now to worry about any major expansions, but I hope the developers work on these things for the next Arkham game; it is too common to see developers getting comfortable with subpar output when they know the game has a dedicated fanbase that largely supports anything with the logo on it. This game is in no way a 10.\"

In addition, Arkham City offers a lot of cool new gadgets, tougher enemies, and a way bigger sandbox to play in.  I've been playing this game for over a month, and I'm still enjoying it (an extreme rarity, due in part to the lack of original ideas new games offer, and in part to my own short attention span).  I'm actually finding it hard to find anything to complain about.  The only thing that comes to mind is that Rocksteady may have gone a bit overboard on the Riddler challenges this time (440?!), as I'm still not done finding them all.  I do wish that the refresh rate on the smoke pellet was a bit quicker, and that it had it's own quick-button combination (when under fire, you can simply hit Y, but when facing any other enemies you have to manually select it and hit LT+RB to drop it).  Other reviews I've read have complained about the boss battles being too easy, but I actually had a tough time with both Mr. Freeze and Two-Face (for the latter, the endlessly spawning henchmen is a bit of a cop-out, Rocksteady).  Other than that, it would have been nice to free-roam as Robin or Nightwing, but this is not a big deal.I recommend Arkham City for anyone who likes action-adventure games, stealth-based combat games, or games based on comic books.  If you enjoyed Arkham Asylum, you will absolutely love Arkham City.  If you never played AA, you missed out on an awesome game, but AC is great place to jump back in.  The only question now is where will Rocksteady take Batman next...?\"

Wished the main story and side missions had been a bit longer too. Some of the side story villain missions seemed to cut a bit short. Also I have to say how unhappy I am with the Catwoman content unlock pass. I think that really wasn't necessary and it annoyed me a lot that I couldn't share the full content of this game with family members, or that in the future if my profile ever becomes compromised, I may not be able to access the Catwoman content at all. At the very least a PC style revoke tool should have been implemented so that we can move the content to different profiles and xboxs if we encounter problems. And don't believe it doesn't happen, my brother lost his profile to hackers and lost all of his GS and purchased DLC. But apart from that I thoroughly I enjoyed this game and would recommend it to any gamer, even if they aren't a Bats fan. Fantastic game. Congrats to the developers.\"

I find the direction they have gone with the depiction of Batman in these games to be even grittier and perhaps more mentally unstable than the Christopher Nolan films, which are well known for their dark approach to the dark knight. The single player campaign is well paced with the catwoman missions and interesting side missions and when the game comes to an end you will have also collected a number of collectibles and arena missions that can be attempted with batman and also catwoman and robin depending on what DLC you have. Which leads me to the negatives, apart from the short single player and the surprisingly small city, the catwoman and robin DLC not being included on the disc is just a huge annoyance and it is becoming ridiculous, although I know its not the fault of the developer. At the end of the game, a hardcore mode is unlocked, however i didn't particularly want to play it again, as the gameplay can become somewhat repetitive at the end and as the game is story driven and once all of the secrets have been told they don't have the same impact. The arena mode was a nice time waster, but overall i felt that i'd payed 40 for a very enjoyable but very short adventure. For this reason i just couldn't stretch to giving the game a 9 and i'll award it a very high 8/10\"

Before that game I had a lingering curiosity for Batman comics and like everyone else enjoyed the old movies as a kid and now greatly enjoy the Chris Nolan Batman movies.After Arkham Asyulm I wasAs a huge Batman fan, it's possible to say I am a little biased into liking this game more than I should, but it should help to know the only reason I am a Batman fan is Batman: Arkham Asylum. Before that game I had a lingering curiosity for Batman comics and like everyone else enjoyed the old movies as a kid and now greatly enjoy the Chris Nolan Batman movies.After Arkham Asyulm I was hooked. So when Arkham City was announced, there was very little to keep me from squealing like a school girl. The few weeks before it's release the sinking feeling crept into me, what if its not good? What if it contains a similar lack luster ending? Well now that it here and I have played it for a week I can safely say, This is single handedly the best game I have played all year and a glorious follow up to 2009's Arkham Asylum.Every aspect has been improved upon. Combat now flawlessly incorporates gadgets and new combo moves while feeling as fluid as ever. The player starts with just about every gadget from the first game and is able to upgrade them throughout. By the end, every gadget has multiple functions and juggling which way to tackle a new objective or puzzle is dependent on your knowledge of your equipment.Stealth action is back and can now be even more challenging than the extreme challenge maps from the first game without feeling frustrating. A player could get through the entire game relying on tactics from the first game, but new gadgets and moves make combat and stealth much more exciting and diverse.While the story missions are the primary draw and are given a great deal of effort and detail, its the side missions that really shine. Anyone who blows through the main game and skips the side missions are really missing out. They encompass everything from investigating a serial killer, to tracking an assassin, and working with former enemies. Fans of the comics will get the most out of these missions as they contain debuts of lesser known Batman villains. But non-comic readers will also enjoy these as they may also contain hints about possible sequels.On to the story. While the side missions tend to focus on one Bat-villain each, the story is packed so full of foes you would think they would be stepping on each others toes. But each villain has a purpose. Some might find these cameos not as fleshed out as they should be. A few well known villains are given very little screen time, But I think each character is handled expertly. Only being involved in the story in a natural way, never feeling jammed in or forced.What really pulls it all together is the voice acting. As usual Mark Hamill's Joker steals the show. But other voice actors from the Animated Series make their way in. Kevin Conroy continues to prove that he is the greatest actor to don the cape and cowl. Even the original Mr. Freeze voice actor returns adding a chilling calmness to my personal favorite villain in the game. The 5000 character limit isn't enough to go into detail about how great every character featured in the game is, but if there is one more worth mentioning it is the Riddler. After his defeat in Arkham Asylum Edward Nigma is back with a vendetta against the Bat. He now less resembles Jim Carrey's Riddler from the movies and is more reminiscent of Jigsaw.The first game contained Riddler trophies and riddles adding up to a whoping 240 collectibles. Well Rocksteady upped the ante with a staggering 460 trophies, riddles, and breakable objects. And each trophy is no easy snatch-and-grab affair. They are all part of some puzzle that needs to be solved before claiming your prize. Each trophy I came across felt like a portal puzzle only instead of only orange or blue, I had a utility belt full of possible solutions. Not to take into account that I may not have acquired the necessary gadget to solve the puzzle.The climax of the game is where words cease to be able to convey its quality. If the ending was the first games greatest shortcoming, then the ending is the sequel's crowning achievement. It would be unfair for me to try to explain, as words fall short of how to describe the final minutes before the credits roll. So I won't, but I urge every single person who calls themselves a gamer or a Batman fan to play this game.So far Batman: Arkham City is easily my top choice for game of the year. It encompasses the best aspects of every other GOTY contenders. Portal 2's puzzles, Uncharted 3's action adventure and great story telling, L.A. Noire's character detail and voice performance all while tying it up in a neat Batman bow. Don't mistake my meaning for this being some kind of Frankenstein monster of gaming. These are just the best aspects of the great games this year, just all done in one game.\"

The only flaw I see with Arkham City is that one too many villains were in the story and so some villains did not get as much spotlight as they should have but this is a tiny flaw compared to the rest of the game, nothing to damamge the experience.

Additionally, there were some niggling factors in Arkham Asylum, such as repetitive boss battles and unchallenging Riddler Trophies, which have all been massively improve upon in the sequel. It's clear Rocksteady has made great strides to make each boss battle feel unique and interesting. From a technical perspective, Rocksteady is literally pushing Unreal Engine 3 to its limits with Arkham City, and the result is beautiful visuals, fluid animations, and high-detailed character models. I'll be honest, Batman: Arkham City features some of the most incredible art I've ever seen in a game, with Arkham City designed as a dense, macabre and unholy prison - roads and streets are filled with burnt-out cars and trucks, while bags of waste have formed in alleyways. I could go on about just how fantastic Batman: Arkham City, but it's a game that really does have to be experienced by anyone who plays games - not just a Batman fan. It is a monumental feat in game design, and could very well be the first game in a long-time that I can honestly is absolutely perfect.\"

2011,Batman: Arkham City,"Surpassing it's predecessor (Batman: Arkham Asylum) in every way, Arkham City is not only the best comic book-based video game ever made, but it is one of the best games of this console generation. Yes, that is a hefty statement to make, considering this puts it in the league of juggernauts such as Grand Theft Auto IV, Red Dead Redemption, and Fallout 3, but this praise is more than wellSurpassing it's predecessor (Batman: Arkham Asylum) in every way, Arkham City is not only the best comic book-based video game ever made, but it is one of the best games of this console generation. Yes, that is a hefty statement to make, considering this puts it in the league of juggernauts such as Grand Theft Auto IV, Red Dead Redemption, and Fallout 3, but this praise is more than well deserved. From a visual aspect, the recreation of a gritty, dark, and depressing section of Gotham is a dream finally realized in amazing fashion. The quality of the environment, the detail of your surroundings, and the ability to finally take Batman out into a more open world than ever before all come to fruition. While the gameplay is not truly innovative, and does nothing radical that Asylum before hadn't already done, the controls feel polished, the mechanics solid, and the execution of the controls in game is very satisfying. Leaping from enemy to enemy, brawling your way through endless waves of varied enemy types, and delivering bone-crushing finishing blows is yet another satisfying part of the game's overall perfection.The story and voice acting, not to be overshadowed by the visual and gameplay aspects, are really what sells the game for me. Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill ARE the voice of Batman and Joker, respectively. They embody the characters and bring them to life in a story that is full of suspense, a few surprise twists, and an ending that will leave you feeling as if you had watched a dramatic tale come to it's close, all while playing a video game. One issue I would like to address is one that has been brought up in several of the negative reviews. Concerning Catwoman and her inclusion/absence from the game. YES she is included as a downloadable content add-on, but NO she is not a crucial part of the games story. If you buy the game new, you will get her, free of charge. If you buy the game used, and which to play as her, you will have to pay $10 to download her. Her part in the game is short, with 4 very quick chapters to play through. Only one of the chapters significantly adds to the story, but that addition comes in the form of a ""choice"" that is presented to the players that has to be made the right way in order for the story to proceed, so it's not a choice at all. The story can be played without her, as all of the depth to the story she brings come in the form of the cut-scenes she is in, which are not a part of her DLC.Overall, visually, gameplay-wise, and story-wise, Arkham City stands out as the best game released so far this year, and one of the best released in the last decade. A clear contender for Game of the Year, and well deserving of all it's accolades, it has surpassed all other licensed games before it, and will stand as a testament to what a truly perfect game can be.\"
2011,Batman: Arkham City,This game is worth retail price. Story is amazing. The only problem with this game is that it has too many gadgets and upgrades. A minor defect is learning the combos but you can not blame the game if you can't handle awesomeness that is way above average.

2011,Batman: Arkham City,"Game of the year. Improves upon Arkham Asylum in exery aspect. Great main story and effectively developed side missions. The unlockable rewards like character trophies, concept art, interview tapes, bios all adds to the game's epic feel and it feels like a homogenous well conceived product. Getting all the Riddler trohies and challenges is fun and makes you use all your gadgets and your brains :)"
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"This game was pretty solid. It continued the awesomeness that Arkham Asylum started. This game brought in a few new characters (familiar faces) to the series, like cat woman, robin etc. The fighting is epic as you just punish multiple enemies at once and the counter button is pressed a million times.

2011,Batman: Arkham City,A truly stunning game that is a completely worthy sequel to the amazing Arkham Asylum. What the story lacks in focus is made up for with a huge amount of content and detail within the city itself. This game also contains the best sub-quests of any game because they feel like whole plots within themselves. A massive lifespan and stunning looks makes this game a must buy.
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"Batman Arkham City is a well-executed game that doesn't diverge from it's predecessor too much.  I'll start off with the good, as there is plenty of it.

I'll start off with the good, as there is plenty of it.  The game's overall concept is innovative and created relatively high expectations.  For the most part, these expectations were met.  The award-winning combat system is back and the addition of new gadgets, combos, and new characters is enough to evolve this feature.  There are plenty of characters in this game, which some pop out of nowhere as a surprise, which keeps the excitement rolling.  There is plenty of gameplay, with the addition of side-missions, Riddler's Revenge, other characters' campaigns, etcs.  The game's drawbacks are quite noticable to a veteran gamer.  The story is sloppy and will make you question Batman's decision-making abilities.  The overall experience may be fun, but you'll soon realize that Arkham City is quite small, and it becomes extremely formulaic beyond the main story.  While there are more things to do than in Arkham Asylum, it's not too far off from being AA 1.5, which means this game cannot be considered revolutionary.  That title belongs to AA.  The graphics are sub-par and nothing to be excited about.  If you've been gaming on this gen since the start (back in 2005), then you're probably begging for a new generation to pop up already.  Perhaps some sort of innovative multiplayer may have boosted the score to a 9.  Assassin's Creed did this, which ended up being a huge success.  In sum, if you enjoyed AA, you'll enjoy this game too.  Luckily, Rocksteady will most likely put off Batman 3 until next gen, which will hopefully feature all of Gotham City.\"
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"Easily one of the best games of 2011, the voice acting and characters alone set this apart from most of everything else from 2011.

I personally felt that Arkham Asylum got a bit too repetitive and this one was no better. However the story and everything that revolved around that really makes this a great game, if for nothing else than to hear Mark Hamill perform his final performance of the Joker. The ending is great and I feel that everyone should play this if just to see how things turn out for our favorite bat. A couple of issues I saw were that Catwoman's story, a major part of the game, is not available from the start. You need to download it and good luck if you buy this used. Playing her story will cost you 10 more bucks, which means you should just buy it new until the price goes down if you want to experience the full story. Another thing I didn't like was the fact that pretty much 90% of the available side missions in the game were just to collect Riddler trophies. I expected something more when they said there would be hours of side missions to do. I did not want to waste around 8-9 hours of my life on a glorified fetch quest. Other than those things, this is a must play. Whether you want to experience the catwoman part of the story is completely up to you as it's not totally necessary to enjoy this game but you will miss out on alot if you don't play it.\"

From the cinematic opening to the shocking ending the storytelling is as good as it gets. The gameplay is excellent, Rocksteady took the combat system from Arkham Asylum and managed to improve it. The pairing of Batman and the open-world form was an excellent choice and Rocksteady excels at making Arkham City feel alive. The side missions are fun and entertaining and the Riddler trophies are always a challenge. This is probably my favorite game this generation and I am eagerly awaiting the next Rocksteady game.\"

I beat Dark Souls in a couple days because I love ""a challenge"" with Arkham City I love the masterfully crafted world which you transverse.  I have never been a huge comic book fan but this game makes Batman a living character in a living world.  He navigates around the environment as you imagine he might if he were real.  The villains, although not a challenge, are still fun mini puzzles that are a blast to see in action.  They actually have the  personalities like you would expect from the characters you have heard about since childhood.  That isn't even to touch on the sheer amount of recorded voice content the player can overhear while traversing the area.  These conversations let the player see how the various villians are interacting with each other.  Rocksteady studios actually makes you feel like Batman in a living city and they do it with flair and subtle, clever invention.  On top of all that the game is huge; especially if you take into account all the side missions, Riddler trophies and of course the challenge arenas.  I have never written a review on this site before but I would like to start so that companies that put blood, sweat, and tears into extremely polished content such as this game, can get the lip service they truly deserve.\"
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"As a huge fan of Batman I am just happy and proud to say that Batman: Arkham City is one of the if not the best best super hero and comic book game of all time.

Arkham Asylum itself was a great game but Arkham City just almost surpasses it in every way. Instead of an island we have a whole large city to explore and there is so much stuff to do that once you get yourself into this amazing Batman universe you will not want to escape. This game just makes you feel like you are Batman. They also bring in alot of villians from the Batman universe all the classic villians like Two-face, Joker, Penguin among others are all here that is just pure nostalgia for long time Batman fans like myself. The main mission itself is very long and enthralling and will easily take you around 20 to 25 hours and it is just totally awesome with so many areas that you to stealth and even fight your way through in this game, some sections of the game where you have to put your fun gadgets to good use. And perhaps the biggest improvement in this game is the boss battles instead of mostly having thug battles, this game actually provides good, well designed and fun boss battles all of which are very unique and entertaining in their own. The Story despite being a little confusing and complex at times fits the batman universe and once you beat a mission you will just keep coming back for more as this game just sucks you in its universe. But thats not all there is to it, the game has even more and better challenges than its predecessor, the ability to play as Catwoman and Robin via DLCs, other side missions within the game and even the riddler challenges and trophies are funner to do this time around. The only drawback is that in order to understand the Catwoman's part of the story and get all the riddler's challenges done in the game you have to buy her DLC from the get go which may prevent some players from experiencing the whole game if they cannot afford it. Completing the game 100% will take you more than 40 hours which gives this game a very long lasting appeal along with its already high replay value. The music and voice acting are just excellent, the music always suites the environment and builds the feel of the game and all the actors provide excellent voice overs for all the characters with ofcourse Mark Hamill stealing the show as Joker. The graphics are also awesome, the characters models are well detailed and the environments are just excellent the game itself provides a really great comic book feel. In the end Batman Arkham City is a great achievement on the part of Rocksteady Studios and arguably the greatest superhero and comic book game of all time and a potential contender for the Game of the Year 2011. I am proud to be a  Batman fan.\"

A beautifully rendered world created specifically for Batman (ahem, and *Catwoman*) to prowl and terrorize the weak and evil criminals of Gotham (err Arkham?). Batman is a walking Weapon of Mass Destruction in this game, it's utterly insane how awesome it is to kick ass with the Bat. And Catwoman is rendered PERFECTLY. Playing with her with put a smile on your face EVERY SINGLE TIME. It's heavenly. While the game has a few flaws, the lack of Two-Face who disappears after an awesome intro until the end of the game, NO BATMOBILE (this disappointed me the most because the open world set up literally invites this idea to be in the game, come on Rocksteady add the Batmobile PLEASE!!!), and some minor hiccups along the way that I won't spoil.

2011,Batman: Arkham City,"This is one of those games where the developer took a big risk that could have gone horribly wrong and ended up going almost perfectly. Its not easy to expand what was a fairly linear start to the series and open it out into a huge open world, but Arkham City's upgrade into the big city from the confined space of the Asylum couldn't have gone better. The entire landscape feels detailedThis is one of those games where the developer took a big risk that could have gone horribly wrong and ended up going almost perfectly. Its not easy to expand what was a fairly linear start to the series and open it out into a huge open world, but Arkham City's upgrade into the big city from the confined space of the Asylum couldn't have gone better. The entire landscape feels detailed from the rooftops to the floor, and the end result is that you feel like your Batman as he should be, not locked up on an island but swinging and gliding through a whole city.Anyone who has played Arkham Asylum will be familiar with the gameplay, you have your quick paced hand to hand combat to take down unarmed guards, your slower stealth parts to take down armed guards, platforming to get around the landscape and a bit of puzzle solving. All strung together with beautiful pacing that keeps you from getting bored or feeling like your sick of any one part of the game. Add on the incredible boss fights that pit Batman with nothing but his mobility, his gadgets and his wits, against opponents who are bigger/stronger/more well equipped than you are. But as should be expected, Rocksteady updated the gameplay with new gadgets, new abilities and new enemies to renew the gameplay and once again make you feel like the Batman. Not just because your playing as Batman and swinging down from pillars to string up bad guys, but because the entire time your being made aware of the fact that you are the one enemy everyone is united against, and everyone everywhere is learning and developing to try and get the better of you.In terms of presentation the game hasn't missed a beat since the last. The voice acting is superb, the city is expansive and detailed, the graphics are brilliant.. Its a lesson in how to present your game to the player and make them feel immersed in the experience.As for the story, once again Rocksteady is proving what separates its Batman series from every other super hero game out there, and to be honest most other games out there. Anyone with a vague knowledge of the Batman universe will instantly click with what is going on but even if you haven't there is plenty of information given as to the situation you find yourself in. You start out having been arrested as Bruce Wayne by the current man in charge of Arkham City, Hugo Strange, the man who has discovered that Bruce Wayne is Batman. From there you desperately try to figure out what Strange has planned, the mysterious ""Protocol 10"". Soon enough however Batman is put onto a search with much more on the line.Not only the best licensed game ever made, one of the best sequels ever made too. An epic story, a detailed city, well paced gameplay that constantly makes you feel like you are the Dark Knight himself. Not just a game for Batman fans but a must buy for any gamer.\"

To start off, Arkham City has a beautiful control set that anyone already familiar with Arkham Asylum will immediately sinkTo rate this as a ""game"" would be an injustice to both Batman and Rocksteady, rather, I must rate this as an experience. I'm afraid most of this article will be just a bunch of redundancy and repeats of what has already been said but I'm going to say it all anyways. To start off, Arkham City has a beautiful control set that anyone already familiar with Arkham Asylum will immediately sink into. Yes, some of you may say ""its only two buttons!"" well..its not. Yes, you punch with X and you counter with Y but a player of skill can make this game as complicated as he wants to by implementing gadgets. If you prefer to keep it simple, then please, enjoy the two button attack set. Now, the gadgets I did find a little annoying at times when I needed to use them RIGHT AWAY, but  hotkeys are provided  when the gadgets are most crucial to make this possible. There are some other common complaints that I want to address: a) ""This game is too easy!"", I found the game a trifle challenging actually, especially when I was expected to take upwards of 8-15 men armed with assault rifles down stealthily in a tiny room. If you feel the game is too easy, then turn up the difficulty. If its still to easy then go buy a batsuit and become Batman, perhaps that will be a challenge for you. b) ""Rocksteady screwed us over! You have to buy the game to play as catwoman!"" So what? I think if I were a game developer I would do this too. You have no rights to bonuses supplied by the developer if you didn't purchase this from the developer. I am all for buying games secondhand but I think that game developers have every right to combat this in any way possible. As for those of you that are without xbox live I am terribly sorry but what is Rocksteady to do? c) ""Navigating in the game is too hard!"" See the big bat symbol in the sky? Yeah, follow it...Now to get to the part where I just get down on my knees and praise this game for what it is. OH MY MERCIFUL GOD the voice acting is -amazing-. For any one who has loved Batman since 90s, you will find yourself full of nostalgia as you hear the age-old voices of Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy. There are some new voices as well for other characters but they are done incredibly well. The story is also incredible. At first it felt a little bit under-developed in comparison to that of Arkham Asylum but once I got towards the second half everything started to really dramatize and then I allowed myself to be completely swept away into it. PAY ATTENTION, because I did not and I found I was kicking myself when it all wrapped up. Treat this game more like an M. Night Shyamalan film (one of his good ones) and expect the unexpected. I think another paragraph has to be devoted to just the fan-service this game has to offer. Although the main storyline only includes around 5 or so villains, the side stories and challenges offer plenty of nostalgia for anyone who wants to see some old faces. I do truly enjoy how they changed some of the characters to fit this realistic tone. Two-Face took on a very Dark Knight-like visual, and Mr. Freeze got an update too, to name a couple. To sum up, this game is absolutely incredible. And any small gripe I have with it is easily smashed by its incredibleness (is that a word?). The graphics are amazing, especially for such a large game. The voice acting is top-notch, the combat is engaging, the story is ZOMFG...the game just plain ranks with the best of the best.Why are you still reading this? Go out and buy this game. And if you can, get the collector's edition, its definitely worth the extra 30 bucks.\"
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"Batman: Arkham City is exactly what a sequel should be; it expands on the fantastic story and formula that the original game created. You start off with nearly all of your gadgets from Arkham Asylum; none of the cliche ""oops you lost all of your gear you already earned"" that  was popularized in games like the first two Metroid Prime games (not implying that those we bad games, it's just asBatman: Arkham City is exactly what a sequel should be; it expands on the fantastic story and formula that the original game created. You start off with nearly all of your gadgets from Arkham Asylum; none of the cliche ""oops you lost all of your gear you already earned"" that  was popularized in games like the first two Metroid Prime games (not implying that those we bad games, it's just as an example here). No Batman:AC only builds on the foundation that was set before it. More great bat-gear, more bad guys, more riddles, more free flow combat moves, more challenges, basically more of everything that made the first game great and memorable. The voice acting is top notch (though I can say the dialogue itself is a little bit generic superhero speak, we get it Batman ""today is a bad day to mess with you""), the visuals stand out more (just watch the details like how snowflakes fall on the dark knight's cape), and the map of Arkham City is much larger and dense to explore than back on Arkham Island.All that being said, I did feel that the main story line was a little shorter than I expected, if only by an hour or two. Maybe it's just because I ran through it so fast knowing that was a new game plus mode waiting on me. Or maybe it was because the story line was just something I had to continue despite all the enticing distractions like the character side quests or Riddler trophies. Or maybe even it was that the learning curve is much smaller than it was in Arkham Asylum since I've already saved the day (night) with Batman once before. Whatever the reason, the result of this story line left me a bit taken back and certainly wanting to find out more of what happens after this long long night. Hopefully there will some expanding on the story line in the future with DLC or even a third game in the years to come. Regardless, what matters most is this: if you enjoyed Arkham Asylum, or if you've ever wanted to know what it would be like to be Batman, this is the best interpretation you will ever get. Do yourself a favor and pick up this game, you won't regret it.\"

Blah blah we get the point. however what they are failing to see is that the game itself is gorgeous, voice acting is astounding beyond words, and the story is better compared to what other video games have tried to offer. I also see a lot of reviewers saying that They have to play as Catwoman. First off, it is downloadable. Secondly she is in the story of Batman, and goes way back to the origins. I think we as gamers, should take the time and collectively give Rock Steady a round of applause for an absolutely great game!\"
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"What's not to love about this game? It's Batman meets Assassin's Creed. A huge improvement over the last game, and the last game was pretty good. My only complaint is that I wish they let you explore the sandbox environment a little more before pushing certain elements of the main storyline. If you like Batman, video games and fun, buy this game."

2011,Batman: Arkham City,"Gather 'round, children, and I'll tell you a story. A story of Best Buy, a stroke of luck, and a caped crusader. It was a dark and stormy night. A young MrMayge awaited his parents ruling on the content of a certain Battlefield game. As lightning crashed, his father emerged from the next room, shaking his head. It was at this time that MrMayge started on his quest for a game to satisfy him until the newest Halo or Alan Wake episode.As he was browsing through GameStop, he happened to glance at a demo of Batman: Arkham City. He looked through his old Official Xbox Magazines and GameInformers and consumed all of the information he could about this odd game. Then, two weeks before it's release, MrMayge was the proud holder of a pre-order receipt for Batman.I got home and started playing Batman, and was at first overwhelmed by the freedom and scope usually only seen in  games like Grand Theft Auto.I was also intrigued by the game's unique story. Involving the main villains Joker, Mister Freeze, Poison Ivy, and The Riddler. Basically, the Joker tricks Batman into helping him survive the TITAN toxin he injected himself with in the first game.There are also side missions, like a mysterious hooded man who you sometimes find watching you, and when you approach him he says random things like, ""Are you the one the prophets foretold of?"" and dissapears. Another side mission involves a deranged serial killer who calls you whenever he's about to take a victim.The combat is also superb. Attacking is as easy as pressing ""X"" and pointing Batman (or Catwoman, Nightwing, or Robin) in the right direction. Doing cool counter-attacks is as easy as hitting ""Y"" when prompted. You'd think such a simplistic combat system would seem repetitive, but after seeing my 10,000th kick in the teeth, I'm still not bored of the face-bashing.I would've waited until I finished the game to do this review, but after seeing not one, but DOZENS of people give it less than what it deserves (a 10), I had to even the score.\"

The story is quite intriguing (which was the big thing I was worried about going in - Batman:AA had a great story and I was worried about ""sequel story syndrome"" of making a cheesy story just to sell a new game).  There are definite 'holy crap' moments in the plot (no spoilers here) where you are left asking- ""did that just happen?'  The story is great because it appeals to a wide audience while at the same time including many easter eggs for comic junkies like myself.  I keep reading the description that this game is now a ""sandbox"" game.  That isn't any more true than the first game- sandbox games (like GTA for example) have a 'go anywhere, do anything' mantra.  While the open world of Batman:AC is much larger than the Asylum, you still are bound by definitely rules- you can't swim, you can't kill the cops, etc - therefore, NOT A SANDBOX GAME.  I've read that the transportation in the game is tedious, which couldn't be further from the truth- I can get across the map in about a minute (those who can't just don't know the tools available to them).  Ok, now that I've defended the game against the negative reviews, here are a list of positives--Story on par with the first game (arguably better)-Great gadgets and fighting gameplay-Pretty graphics with great ambiance and light contrast to create the proper dark Gotham city feel-Enjoyable side missions-Unlike the first game, there is a reason to solve all of the Riddler puzzles (doing so advances your pursuit of one of the major side missions)-Aside from the story mode, the addictive challenge mode is back - and even more fun with Catwoman, Nightwing, and Robin, each of whom have unique fighting abilities and styles (they're not just 'skins' over the Batman fighting model)All I can say is- buy this game- for what it is, there is really nothing better in the genre, period.\"

But really when I get to be a super badass Batman to do all these ""chores"" I can't complain too much. This game is great and a must buy. It might be a challenge to achieve 100% completion but I think Rocksteady had that in mind when creating it. It will be a challenge I will be happy to suit up for days to come.\"

This is one game where a perfect score is not an exaggeration, it takes everything good from the series past and improves upon it in such refreshing and exciting ways. The inclusion of the Wii motion plus controls is also a very big contribution to the games overall greatness. Never has there been a motion controlled game that works so effortlessly, you might even forget you are holding a controller it works so well. I was skeptical they could make it work but it simply does. Something i found very interesting was the fact that the game does not use the pointer on the Wii remote AT ALL. All items that require aiming use the position tracking of the motion plus to move the cursor on the screen, if you feel it is out of alignment you simply push down on the d-pad and it centers the cursor for you. It works amazingly well, no longer do you need to make sure you are pointing at the sensor bar. Aside from the controls, the graphics are amazing as well, despite what some ps3/360 fanboys WILL say. The world has been crafted with great care, and the watercolor like style really makes good use of the limited horsepower of the Wii, it is without a doubt the best looking game the system has to offer. But in the end it is all about gameplay, thankfully the game is no slouch in this department either. Many people have complained that zelda hasn't done enough in recent years to go beyond what was done in Ocarina of time. I am happy to tell these people that is NOT the case with this game, in fact it feels like every single thing you do in the game is taking your expectations of the series and shattering them, in a very good way. The dungeons are all very well done and they are spread out at a good pace, you will have plenty to do between dungeons. The bosses are probably the best the series has ever seen, each new boss you fight gets more and more epic and will actually give you a challenge. Last but not least is the story. This is the first game in the series story wise and it will definitely blow your mind if you have been a fan of the series since the beginning. Finally the connection between all the games has become more clear than ever, I won't spoil a single thing for you but rest assured zeldas story has never been better. I feel like i have said enough about the game now, please ignore the 360/ps3 trolls giving the game a 0, they have not played the game and are simply trolling as trolls do. I give the game a 10 because it deserves it, simple as that.\"

2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"One of the best Zelda games of the series. It's both a pleasure to play and just watch the people and environment. Also the controls are completely fine, gamespot just hires a bunch a dumbasses. There is nothing wrong with them they are responsive and fun to use."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"Skyward Sword stands at the peak of the Nintendo videogame-crafting. It's colorful but eerie atmosphere, the polished gameplay and the amazing plot builds the greatest game in the series."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"I have all the Zelda games, and Skyward Sword is my favorite. The story is amazing, gameplay is fun, and controls make Zelda a rare gem in video games. This is my game of the year."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"This is a great game. I can understand why people may have minor gripes with it, but anything below an 8 is just silly. Not only does it contain everything we love about Zelda already, it really does innovate. The blurriness of distant objects I find truly striking and not unlike a Nintendo nod to Monet and other impressionists right there on my screen, blending seamlessly with the actionThis is a great game.

The blurriness of distant objects I find truly striking and not unlike a Nintendo nod to Monet and other impressionists right there on my screen, blending seamlessly with the action oriented foreground. The controls are not perfect, but they do a damn good job. It's Zelda - chill out from your MW3 session and enjoy it for what it is.\"
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"The Wii was built for this. The motion controls are completely unmatched by any other game, and graphically the game uses all of the Wii's graphical power. The gameplay is amazing, and it's a real change from previous Zelda's. This is the game the Zelda 25th anniversary is deserving of!"
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"i think Oot met his match, the controls are awesome the environments great the story without Ganon is pretty cool, when i expected the same stuff from nintendo, they proved me wrong i maybe have my new favourite game of all times"
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"Just here to balance out the trolls. Honestly anyone who says that the formula is the same hasn't played the game yet. For the first time in a long time, this game doesn't feel like Dungeon -> field-> dungeon. Now everything is integrated into one huge dungeon meaning that you will always be on your toes having fun."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"Please don't listen to the people who are rating the game negative. They are simply Nintendo haters who are plainly jealous that a non HD system is out performing their precious ""hardcore"" games. Skyward Sword is a excellent game as evident from the critic reviews. If you're a Zelda fan you simply owe it to yourself to play this game."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"At first, I wasn't sure about this game. I was playing for ages, constantly bouncing between thinking it was brilliant and thinking it was terrible. It was pretty solid, there was no denying that, but something just felt a bit off about it.   But now that I've had the time to play a fair chunk of it (I'm about three temples in, I think), Skyward Sword is easily a contender for best ZeldaAt first, I wasn't sure about this game. I was playing for ages, constantly bouncing between thinking it was brilliant and thinking it was terrible. It was pretty solid, there was no denying that, but something just felt a bit off about it.   But now that I've had the time to play a fair chunk of it (I'm about three temples in, I think), Skyward Sword is easily a contender for best Zelda (and therefore best game) of all time. Everything about it is brilliant. The controls work perfectly (anyone having an issue, try recalibrating your controller), the Dungeons are challenging without being frustrating, combat and monster design is simple yet engaging, The bosses are like the classic bosses of Zelda, but with a new flare to them making them unique.And the graphics are amazing. The environments are absolutely beautiful; especially the third area you go to which is designed flawlessly. Nintendo once again proves that you don't need the best of the best graphics technology to create an amazing, breathtaking world.   In the beginning, I was having a real issue with there not being much of a plot. Things just seemed to be happening with no real explanation and for a while I had no plot-based motivation to keep moving forwards. But I'm now beginning to realise that this was an intentional choice by the designers to withhold information and I'm loving how they're presenting it.  Also, the villain of the game is probably the best non-ganondorf villain in a Zelda game since Majora. He's funny, yet creepy, and with a brilliant physical design that kind of reminds me of David Bowie... Turns out, combining Zelda with David Bowie is actually the greatest thing ever.\"

2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"It's amazing how after telling the same story for 25 years Nintendo continues to have the magic of the first time.Skyward Sword is the best Zelda ever.For several years we have motion controls. Although we have enjoyed in small portions, their performance was more of a fashion. It is to this day that Fujibayashi and his team of geniuses have given me a tour of a dimension of interactionIt's amazing how after telling the same story for 25 years Nintendo continues to have the magic of the first time.Skyward Sword is the best Zelda ever.For several years we have motion controls. Although we have enjoyed in small portions, their performance was more of a fashion. It is to this day that Fujibayashi and his team of geniuses have given me a tour of a dimension of interaction did not know. My faith has been revived: this is not a fad. The hardware depends on how developers use it. Forget everything you know about the motion controller gaming, Skyward Sword is the true beginning.Skyward Sword starts and doesn't stops. From start to finish, is a feast of amazing and charming characters. Explore new places and enjoy the most beautiful scenery we've seen in a videogame. In most of the adventures we've had in a game just press a button at the right time to get an achievement. However, in Skyward Sword feel firsthand the success to overcome every Bokoblin. It is not meaningless shake control: real enjoyment of defeating an enemy is to give careful consideration to each opponent. We are in the rethinking of how it should work a sword in a game-a fantasy that has been with us since childhood.Skyward Sword Zelda is also the freest Zelda of all. It's a world that you'd want to explore in its entirety. The options are endless, even outside the main story. Hundreds of NPCs have fun tasks you will be always busy.I have purposely avoided the subject of the story. Skyward Sword is something you have to play by yourself.Visually, Skyward Sword has a lot of personality. The graphic style is very original, from the introductory sequence to the credits, graphics feel fresh. They are very similar to the magnificent and original style of Street Fighter IV.The dungeons in Skyward Sword are the best I've seen the series. The battles with the bosses redefine what it means to fight a boss in a videogame. The intelligent design in all the puzzles in the game is a constant feature throughout the adventure. Get ready to find mechanisms similar to those seen in the dungeons of the last games of the series, but now scattered throughout the open world, free from confinement of a room or hallway.From the moment you start Skyward Sword until the last second, is an hearig brutality. The orchestral soundtrack of Koji Kondo and Hajime Wakai is perhaps the most impressive in the history of the medium. Whether you're in a cave or in a vile dungeon impressive, Skyward Sword is a sonic masterpiece. Freedom of sounds and instruments present in this title is something we've never heard in the series. The album included the 25th anniversary of the franchise is not far behind. I confess that I rarely had moved so much a melody as the theme of the source of the Great Fairy.this is the prime example of art in a videogame... simply a must own. 10/10\"
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"This is by far the most expansive and coherent Zelda game ever.  Perfect controls, amazing art style and a heartfelt story make you truly invested in the characters and what happens to them.  The great animations and facial expressions really sell the experience, and the dungeons and side quests are some of the best in the series."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"Absolutely fantastic game. From the moment it begins to the moment it ends, everything about this game is setting the standard for Zelda, the Wii, Nintendo, and video gaming. The controls are perfect, I never want to play The Legend of Zelda with buttons ever again. The motion+ technology fits so seamlessly into the traditional Zelda gameplay that I couldn't help but feel as if maybeAbsolutely fantastic game. From the moment it begins to the moment it ends, everything about this game is setting the standard for Zelda, the Wii, Nintendo, and video gaming. The controls are perfect, I never want to play The Legend of Zelda with buttons ever again. The motion+ technology fits so seamlessly into the traditional Zelda gameplay that I couldn't help but feel as if maybe Nintendo designed the attachment just for the sake of this game. They've given Zelda so much more depth than ever before, every instant is a challenge, and there's no button-mashing in sight.I don't want to spoil anything, but the story is beautiful. I'd be willing to call this the best story ever told in a Zelda game, no matter how far fetched that may sound. The wide and varied cast of main and supporting characters differs from the Zelda norm, but it's a refreshing change, and upholds the usual charm that we've come to expect from this series.Unfortunately, the game isn't the best looking thing we've ever seen. Compared to the other big name titles hitting stores this month, it simply isn't as visually impressive. However, it pushes the Wii to its absolute limits, there's definitely no better looking game on the system. It was a wise decision for Nintendo to take a more painted art style approach rather than a realistic one, or else the hardware Zelda has been limited to would really start to show its flaws.Aside from being compared to the big HD titles, the game is very pretty, that's irrefutable. Not to mention the attention to detail Nintendo has put in with character animations and little tweaks, which just make every corner and character in the game feel so alive.In terms of design? The game breaks from the standard Zelda formula. We've still got the forest>fire>ice/water progression as usual, and there are of course familiar elements to the storyline and the world, but past that it's all been revamped, and it's definitely an upgrade. No longer do we have a big empty hub world with dungeons and areas attached to all the corners. No, the overworld is just as dense, challenging and fun as any of the dungeons, and they flow pretty seamlessly together. It's a fun world to explore, and there's a lot of it. Flying is fun. There's not much to it, but it's just... Fun. It's got that breathtaking, discovery feeling that we all loved in Wind Waker, only without the crappy fetchquests and slow travel.This is the definitive Zelda game. A Link to the Past and Ocarina of Time were my childhood, because of how adventurous and exciting and memorable they were, and despite having played all the Zelda games that followed, none managed to evoke those feelings in me again. Until now I thought it was because I'd grown up and had just gotten used to those quality standards, and was enjoying more ""mature"" games. Not any more. Skyward Sword is one of the best games I've ever played, if not THE best. I think in 15-25 years, the current generation of children will remember this adventure as fondly as we all remembered our first Zelda games.10/10.\"

The world would be better off if you all disappeared or went far away and drowned in a lake because you are a waste of space. Now to the great game. I've played Batman: AA, Portal 2 and U3. Skyward Sword is the greatest achievement in games this year. It sets the standard for how motion controls should be used in gaming. Its the equivalent of Mario Galaxy to the Mario series. Nintendo are masters at attention to detail and Skyward Sword is no exception. Everything from the world to NPC's have so much personality and rank as some of the best in the series. Every perfect score you read folks is well deserved. The only equal this game has in 2011 is Arkham City with Skyward Sword edging it out. Zelda is back and better than ever.In the meantime, the trolls should worry less about killstreaks and bashing this masterpiece and losing weight. Stay free you IQ lacking trolls!\"

However it is far to long to explain in 5000 words. Here are the most important things to know about the story: Skyward Sword occurs before all other released Zelda games. It is essentially the prequel to Ocarina of Time. ZeldaThis is my final review of Skyward Sword after beating 100% of the game.I have a very lengthy review that sums up the entire story and all elements of the game. However it is far to long to explain in 5000 words. Here are the most important things to know about the story: Skyward Sword occurs before all other released Zelda games. It is essentially the prequel to Ocarina of Time. Zelda is not a princess, but a childhood friend of Link's. The game explains what the Legend of Zelda is! Yes, this game actually explains where the Legend of Zelda originated from. Skyward Sword also tells the back story of the Master Sword and where Gannon originates from. Although Gannon makes no appearance in this game, you learn he is actually the Evil Will of Demise. Long story short is Demise is the main antagonist in this game and when he is defeated, he curses all decedents of Link and Zelda. Basically saying they will always be fighting his demonic will, as his will can never die. Please note, this was a very very rough breakdown of the story. Skyward Sword's story is very deep. There are many cut scenes and text boxes to read through (no voice acting, but I actually prefer Zelda games to be this way). Fans of the Zelda series will appreciate the amount of references to other Zelda games. Once again, this game will explain many things about the origins of many Zelda characters and items. If you've played Ocarina of Time, then the story alone makes this game a must have. Story 10/10.Moving onto gameplay, Skyward Sword takes full advantage of Wii Motion plus. This means 1:1 sword movements between Link's Sword and your Wii-mote. Your right hand is Link's sword. The entire game is revolved around this and players can expect enemies and puzzles to take advantage of these controls. Enemies will block your attacks unless you attack their weaknesses. Meaning enemies will leave an angle open and you have to attack it. Otherwise, you can swing all day is never land a hit. Now these controls make for a very engaging and satisfying experience. The only drawback from this is sometimes the controls feel over sensitive. Every once in a while Link will do something you don't want him to do. Also, do not fear that you have to stand up and fling your Wii mote around. The controls do not require you to make full sword swing motions, and only require a small flick with your wrist. In all, the controls offer a very innovating and add a new experience to the Zelda series.  Gameplay: 10/10Finally, you can expect Skyward Sword to offer 30-50 hours of content. The main story will take at least 20-30 hours to beat on its own. Add in side quests, mini games, and other activities and you can add on another 20-30 hours. In my first playthrough I got everything in the game (completed all quests, got every item, found all Goddess cubes/chests, upgraded every item, etc) in just under 50 hours. Its also worth noting that once you beat Skyward Sword you are given the option to save over your file and play Hero Mode. Hero mode is basically a more challenging version of the game. All enemies do double damage and enemies never drop hearts unless you have the heart medal. The player is given the option to skip some cut scenes, and a few other perks are given to the player (eg: the Skyward Strike attack is at master sword level as soon as you obtain the Goddess Sword).  ITS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ONCE YOU CHOOSE TO OVER RIDE YOUR SAVE FOR HERO MODE THAT YOU'LL LOOSE YOUR NORMAL GAME SAVE!!!! This means if you choose to go hero mode, everything on your save will be lost in favor of the hero mode save. To avoid this, make sure you copy your file before going into Hero mode. Skyward Sword will keep you busy for months to come. 10/10 re-playability.Some TL DR stuff:- 10/10 game, MUST HAVE for Wii owners- 7 temples-30-50 hours of gameplay (60-100 hours if you complete Hero mode)- 1:1 sword control- Amazing Story*Please note I did not mention anything about the areas you will explore. It would take pages to go through all 3 areas, plus the clouds. The only thing to know is Skyward Sword is designed to include ""temple elements"" throughout the mainland. This means you'll have to constantly solve puzzles and defeat bad guys to gain access to new lands.\"

2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"Ok so I got this game a few days ago and still have a long way to go but I had to write a review in response to so many people who rated this 0. 0? seriously are you really that bitter that you think this game has absolutely nothing to offer? even if you think you are too grown up to play Zelda (im 27 and I can swallow my pride to play a less mature game) and you think the graphics look aOk so I got this game a few days ago and still have a long way to go but I had to write a review in response to so many people who rated this 0. 0? seriously are you really that bitter that you think this game has absolutely nothing to offer? even if you think you are too grown up to play Zelda (im 27 and I can swallow my pride to play a less mature game) and you think the graphics look a few years old you have to admit that the game play and the controls are quite spectacular, the experience it creates for the first time with motion controls gives a sense of reality that all these other high end graphics button bashing games can't achieve. Yes the formula of quirky characters, dungeons and puzzles is similar to previous Zelda titles but why break a wining formula. Any one who is unsure about this game don't listen to the 0 reviews they are people who are more entertained by style rather then substance (not that this game doesnt have style). I will say that it takes a few hours to really get in to the game as the first part introduces the story and controls. This game isnt perfect and in my opinion so far doesnt deserve 10/10 but not many games do but there are several moments in the game that are 10/10 and unrivalled by any game on any other system purely because of the unique controls. I want to see more games use this control system and yes it would be good to have better graphics and some blood and gore but not in a Zelda game. I was playing Skyrim all last week and was addicted but I cant go back to it until Zelda is completed because pointing in the right direction and bashing a button seems so unsophisticated now. The only thing that bugs me about this game is not so much the graphics but that the Wii doesnt support HD so doesnt do the art style of the game any justice.\"
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"I love how jealous these negative reviews are. Just because the game is better than your copy/paste MW3 or BF3, does not give you the right to nerd-rage and give Skyward Sword a 0. None of these negative reviews have given me any good, solid reason as to why they gave it that score, proving to me that they're just angry Sony/Microsoft fanboys. Don't listen to the negativity. Now onto theI love how jealous these negative reviews are. Just because the game is better than your copy/paste MW3 or BF3, does not give you the right to nerd-rage and give Skyward Sword a 0. None of these negative reviews have given me any good, solid reason as to why they gave it that score, proving to me that they're just angry Sony/Microsoft fanboys. Don't listen to the negativity. Now onto the review: I've played about 60% of the game and I think that I should judge it. First of all the graphics: not an important factor, I know, but the graphics are breathtaking. The overall world is beautiful and it's as if you're looking at masterpiece painting. Truly a work of art and it shows that Nintendo can create beauty even without HD graphics. 10/10 Gameplay: Amazing! Each dungeon will have something new to offer and even before each dungeon you have to A LOT of different things in order to even enter it. The boss battles are fresh, fun, and challenging and each temple requires you to think for a good amount of time before you act. Flying on the Crimson Loftwing is also engaging since it is something different. While it is simlar to Wind Waker's Boat sailing, I do find flying much more enjoyable because I feel you interact with it a lot more, making it less tedious. The game also allows you to dash which is great if you want to get to one point as fast you can. My only problem is that a shield breaks when it loses its shield meter. This is not a huge deal as it takes a while for it to break, and you can always buy another one. It also introduces a new challenge to the game. 9.8/10 Story: Great. The story is about Link trying to find Zelda and trying to forge the master sword, and all these events lead up to the events in Ocarina of Time. It may sound cliched, but when you actually play the game, you will find the story very engaging. You can read more of the story at http://www.zeldadungeon.net/Zelda14-skyward-sword-story.php 9.5/10 Controls: Perfect. The Wii Motion Plus responds to you every movement. It is so satisfying having to swing the sword in one direction and making Link swing it the same direction. It truly leaves the player proud when he or she has defeated and enemy since it's like they're holding the sword themselves. Holding the shield is also very engrossing since you have to flick the nunchuk upwards in order to activate it. Flick it forward to activate the shield bash, similar to the shield attack in Twilight Princess. It's perfect and it is exactly what I wanted the Wii to do in the first place. My only problem is the flying. You have to turn the Wii remote in a certain direction to steer the bird, and this can get a tad bit frustrating sometimes since the controller does not fully respond to this at times. Not a big deal, though. For 98% of the time, the controls are very responsive and very well done. 9.8/10Music and sounds: Splendid. Every track in this game is beautifully done by a symphony orchestra. Music is always a strong point in Zelda, but I feel that in SS, Nintendo has really outdone itself. Marvelous orchestrated music adds to the suspense and as to the feel of the game, and it really is one of the many assets of the game. The sound effects are also great, such as the ""clank"" when you hit another enemy's sword with your own. Or when you slice another enemy. Nintendo has truly done a wonderful job in this aspect. 10/10Overall, Skyward Sword is a fantastic game. From it's graphics, music, and gameplay, the game really shows what Nintendo is truly capable of. It seems as if Nintendo took their time to make this game, and all their hard work was well worth it. This game is the best Wii game, no scratch that, the best game I have picked up. It is a true masterpiece and, in my opinion, ties with Skyrim for Game of the Year. I give this game an overall score of 9.8/10\"

2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"5 years in waiting for a console Legend of Zelda and by god, it is very satisfying to play a brand new Zelda game on the big screen. I have been playing for 18 hours since Friday so this is a good amount of time to finally do a review. Even though Skyward Sword has the Zelda name, it feels like a complete departure from the other games and I felt like I was playing a newly realized Zelda.5 years in waiting for a console Legend of Zelda and by god, it is very satisfying to play a brand new Zelda game on the big screen. I have been playing for 18 hours since Friday so this is a good amount of time to finally do a review. Even though Skyward Sword has the Zelda name, it feels like a complete departure from the other games and I felt like I was playing a newly realized Zelda. Dungeons are still here but the only difference is that the whole world map is a big fat dungeon and I think it's an interesting take on Zelda tradition. The main selling point of the game is its fully implemented motion controls and while it works really well, it's not perfect as it can get frustrating at times, especially when you're in combat, aiming a long range weapon or playing your musical instruments, all requiring motion based gameplay but you will get used to it and in time, it becomes second to nature as the controls has a tight learning curve. The layout scheme itself has also changed (for the better) as the item menu is pretty much at your firsthand disposal instead of pausing into the menu and picking the item then un-pausing, leading to a more fast paced gameplay. The story is the most cinematic I have ever seen in a Zelda game and the visual and graphical style is jaw dropping gorgeous to look at and while I should be half way to through the story, it's pacing is slower compared to the other games but its memorable characters, emotional attachments and atmosphere makes it worthwhile. In conclusion, this is the best game I have played this year alone and the best Wii game because it completely realize and utilizes what the console can do. Albeit not being perfect, the motion controls does its job easing you in the game's mechanics so well that the frustration is forgotten in seconds and the visual style makes Skyward Sword the best looking Zelda game since Windwaker and the best looking game on the Wii overall. If you have a Wii, you have to buy this game as sadly, this is might be the Wii's final swansong in its six year lifespan and by god, what a way to go.\"

And even the one reviewer that said ""then again, it's a Wii game."" sounds like he barely lifted a finger to give it a proper chance.Now, being someone who HAS played the game, let me say that the positive reviews are absolutely warranted and deserved.  Nintendo has truly stepped up their game this time around, by giving us an adventure that's as fun to play, as it is hard to STOP playing.I've been reading a lot of complaints about the ""unresponsive"" motion controls, and it tells me that some people expected the same waggle-gaggle action that Twilight Princess and the original Wii Sports had.  That icon at the bottom of the box, symbolizing Wii MotionPlus, means that while it DOES accurately track your motions, you should really give yourself time to get used to it.  Remember the frustration in trying to score a strike in Wii Sports Resort? Yeah?  Then be patient!  After time, the controls are very easy to adapt to.  And if you DON'T remember, then maybe you should play Wii a bit more often.Of course, where's a Zelda game without the story?  This game is set back before Ocarina of Time, and while it isn't an admittedly PERFECT story it's better fare than any of the war games that are out today.Between the variety of gameplay options, the vast amount of quests and things to do, the compelling story, and the amazing MotionPlus-enabled combat, Zelda Skyward Sword truly is the best Wii game ever, and possibly the best game I've played all year.Speaking of, I'm gonna get back to that now.\"

It is very difficult to state this is the best Zelda ever. You can observe it in two ways; is it the best Zelda gameplaywise and technically? Yes, it is. It has the gameplay of all the Zelda games and has the best graphics and power. Some dungeondesigns are pretty good. I am pleased they attempted to use more dungeonthemes than just the standard earthelements like forest, water, fire. This time you will use more creative elements like timeshiftstones and pirates. Also the motion controls adds more feel to the game. This is easily the best motion game out there, because it works. the swordfighting is very responsive and I always get an exciting feeling when approaching an enemy, even after 30 hours. You fight only because it's fun while you can just run away. Only Nintendo is able to do this in this video game generation. The graphics are the best in a Zeldagame yet. It combines Windwaker with Twilight Princess and adds a waterpainting feeling to it when watching in the distance. The closer you are to an object, the sharper it gets. although, sometimes it is just a pixelmess.And then there is another way to review this game. Nintendo already knew fans wanted some changes in the Zeldaformula. You can see they tried with this game. But the things they tried, like returning to already done dungeons, an upgradesystem for your items like shields, potions and the beetle, adding a staminameter, collecting upgradeitems, are not the most creative elements out there in the game. This has already done many times before, therefore it adds no new feeling to it really. It feels like a combination of some old gameplaymechanics with the Zelda-formula (Darksiders gave me the same feeling, combines Zelda with god of war). the changes didn't really stunned me in a way the older Zeldagames did when they were new. It is often predictable what to do when you're stuck, like looking to the ceiling or use the new item you get, because you recognize the situation, it feels very familiar. Of course, some people will only appreciate this nostalgia-feeling. But I already thought Zelda TP felt to familiar and therefore the puzzels were easy. This Zelda has gone some changes in the original formula, but not enough. Don't ask me what is necessary to give a Zelda game a whole new feeling to it but at the same time also feels like a Zelda-game, that is for Nintendo to find out. This is CERTAINLY not a bad game! Gameplaywise it is still one of the best games this game-moviegeneration. But is doesn't stunned me like Mario Galaxy did compared to other Mario-games. Galaxy felt VERY creative, did many things new and still felt like a Mario-game. It is time for the next Zelda to do the same. I heard Miyamoto is leading the first Zelda HD. I can't wait to see what they will do with this one.\"

That's what players have come to love of this series and if they changed it then we wouldn't have Zelda anymore. Unresponsive controls? What game are you playing? This probably has some of the best usage of the Wii remote to date. The story is plenty intriguing to grab an audience and keep them playing. Everything seems more thought out, and more time was put into the final product. They use cinematic parts to help with the story driving creating drama and all sorts of emotions. The characters are amazing, and well Link is still Link. Best looking game on the Wii and totally worth a buy. 10/10 from me, Zelda is still going strong.\"

This game is so bad that it is literally the only zelda game i didnt finish because i got that sick of it. (Completing the sword was the last thing i did. I dont recommended this game at all unless you want to experience incredibly bad motion controls.

Grainy graphics, controller goes crazy when you look off the field, the controller is not precise, enemies in spite of the above the new Motion Plus controller, are killed simply shaking the controller. And then the most important thing, the story,missing the magic, the soul is lacking, there is no involvement, few dialogues. It looks like a game made in a hurry to go to meet business needs, putting together the pieces of the previous Zelda,yet they have had 5 years of time.

Your relationship with zelda is higher, and from the point when she is captured you start to really care about it and get motivated to save her. The motion control works incredibly, and the boss battles are fun and epic. The cut scenes are fantastic, and the characters are memorable in different ways, or because he (or she) is a **** or because he is dumb, but starts helping you, and end up being the nicest guy in the game. The history is cool, not that much but pretty cool. If you're a zelda fan, you should buy this game. No doubts one of the best games nintendo made until now, and a major game in history of gaming.\"

In Skyward Sword, the game is designed around the motion controls, and many of the controls don't feel like they could really be replicated without them.  They're very intuitive; my only complaint is at times they can be finicky -- i.e. they don't always respond to what you're *thinking* -- for example, you are thinking ""swipe this way"" but occasionally instead it swipes a different way.  But the game is fun enough that even this seems to be a minor frustration compared to how much the game ROCKS.Not quite perfect, but just about as close as it gets.\"

From my perspective, this new generation of consoles (the ps3 and xbox) have gone far into destroying what I remember most proudly of what videogames were about, and what I remember about them, comes back from the days of the N64. It was all about, creativeness, crazy and memorable characters, also crazy and memorable places, and just simply pure unadult fun! Admittably this generation has its share of good and popular games, but they lack the escence of it all, atleast that is what I feel. Nintendo is the only company keeping up with this magic and Skyward Sword shows this every second while at the same time being intutive, new and fresh. In terms of gameplay, theirs simply no game like it, the Wiis motion plus adds so much to the game in terms of combat and gameplay mechanics. They are not perfect per say, but work pretty well and definately makes it more fun than its predessesors. Its level design is pure Nintendo brilliance. Its story is surprisingly emotional and memorable, at the end, it really maked me feel much more than many other games and this one doesnt even have voice acting, its just pure text. Its grahics are beautiful and artistic. In a generation were developers focus on being more realistic with each game, Skyward Sword is a gift from heaven and definately a game I am sure I am going to remember more in terms of its looks than those others gray and black games. Its music is also spectacular with some tunes being orchestrated; Zelda has always had great music and this one is no different. So in terms of basics, this game is outstanding, no matter from what angle, but the different details it offers makes it a true masterpiece. Its easily 30-35 hour adventure and considerably more with its hidden content, making it once again stand out from the rest of the pack in a time were games last 5-10 hours(call of duty), admittably a portion of the game felt like padding ( the third trip to the forest and volcano surfaces) but as an experience it holded incredibly strong during the entire game. This game its full of great moments, and it accomplishes so much more than most other games. I really liked this game alot! Is this the best Zelda? That is debatetable, as it also changes alot of of things that we are accostumed in the series and that may be welcomed differently by each person, but wether it is the best or not (i have not concluded, as each one is so outstanding in its own way) I from the bottom of my heart can conclude that this is a masterpiece of a game, and is so much more than alot of games that come everyday. My game of the year!\"
2011,Portal 2,"Portal 2 has it all.  A worthy sequel to the original.  The single player focus on story, the co-op on funny.  The best part is the outstanding challenge.  Early puzzles are easy, and most can done quite quickly.  But later on in the game, puzzles get so intense.  The liquid that makes things bounce and slick are a great bonus.   It exceeded my expectations in every way."

The reason it's in the game is because it has apparently been a success in Team Fortress 2, so I don't mind Valve earning an extra buck to fund their next projects.Valve will probably be releasing more free DLC for this game in the future, just like they did with Left4Dead and Team Fortress 2 (a game that's been receiving more than 10 huge free content updates since 2004!). Since the Source SDK is likely to get an update too, the community will get the tools to create maps and puzzles themselves.\"

Much of the bitterness of others probably stems from the underwhelming conclusion of Valve's alternate reality game leading up to the release and the fact that Portal 2 lacks some of the freshness of Portal 1 (but then again, it's a sequel--what do you really expect?).  The brilliance of Portal 1's storytelling came as a surprise to people just expecting an experimental puzzle game; Portal 2, then can only lose points by not having even greater writing/humour/etc.  Regardless, Portal 2 improves on the original with a longer and more challenging single-player mode, a co-op mode, several new mechanics, and more Portal humor.  It's a great sequel to a great game. If the price seems steep to console users, just wait a while and pick it up later--it's worth your time.\"
2011,Portal 2,"Portal 2 is easily the equal of Portal 1, and a fantastic followup that adds much to the already established perfection. Not only is the humor easily as good as last time, the puzzle solving goes from okay, to Portal 1's equal, to amazing and beyond anything Portal ever did over the course of the 7 to 10 hour campaign.

Addressing some concerns that other reviews have said (don't listen to them, they are mad about an ARG and DLC that have nothing to do with the actual game), no, the game is not 3 hours long. No, there is no game-enhancing DLC to get upset about, the DLC, which is PC only in the first place, is purely aesthetic and no one who isn't interested has any reason to buy it. Finally, the ARG that took place before this game was release not only resulted in a midnight release on Steam (as opposed to the planned 7am release), it also got everyone who got all of the ""potatoes"" in the ARG Valve's *entire library of games for free*. There is no reason to dislike this game, and many of the reviews are simply venting frustrations not at all related to the game's quality. It's better in every way than one than the original Portal, save one, originality. And let's face it, that magic has passed, we can't get that moment in time back, so we should enjoy an amazing game for what it is, the best possible sequel to Portal, and the best game of the year so far.\"

2011,Portal 2,"Possibly one of the best puzzles games ever created. Story unfolds much as a movie might, with a plot more complex and entertaining than many movies I've seen.

One of kind, not to be missed."

Unfortunately, the contingent of angry valve ""fans"" have once more been awakened, and trashed the user rating based on other ""fan"" reviews, rumor, dreams, and, apparently, the mutterings of the homeless.As it has become necessary I will now address the erroneous complaints.1. The game is much longer then 4 hours, and is somewhere closer to 8, or 12. This belief could be based around the fact that portal 1 was only about 4 hours, because some ""fans"" are forgetting that the co-op campaign has a completely fleshed out and, different narrative, or some issues that have apparently arisen with the stem ""hours played"" widget.2. There is no ""Launch DLC"" or ""Locked content on the disk"". There is some DLC for cosmetic changes to your co-op avatars, nothing else. You are getting the, as mentioned, full 8-12 hour game. No tricks.3. The Potato ARG... Just in case you didn't know Valve ran a ARG (alternate reality game) for both portal 1, and portal 2, and in the weeks leading up to portal 2's release it was announced that if enough players played the various games in the ""Potato Sack"" bundle of games on steam Portal 2 would be released a little earlier. In a burst of extreme optimism thousands bought the bundle, and played like mad, some claiming that the game would be released as much as 2 days before the ""official"" date. When the game released a mere 3 hours before the ""official"" date however... Never mind the fact that player who did exceptionally well in those games received the entire valve library for free...So to recap. Valve only jumped over the metaphorical pit of fire snakes on a Segway, rather then the magical flying duck that the fan-boys wanted, and now people are whining. I thought we were over this after the whole ""wah! I deserve Left for Dead 2 for free! Left for Dead 1 for free to! Screw actually paying Valve employees! ME WANT FREE STUFF!!!"" debacle of about a year ago, but apparently I was wrong.In closing this is a awesome, funny, original game that took was essentially a 4 hour physics demo, and turned it into a amazing full game.

2011,Portal 2,"Have to say it was definitely worth the wait - The story and dialogue were well written, very funny.

Sure, there are definitely tougher puzzlers out there, but how many are this entertaining?  Any worthy negatives I have with this title are few and far between.  The graphics aren't anything to go crazy about and the occasional platforming elements aren't as tight as they could be (jumping seems a bit off).  The puzzle mechanics are still classic Portal, but the level design does fall victim sometimes to the ""Well, we need the player to have a panel they can make a portal in ... we'll throw one in on the wall over there for the heck of it"" mentality when you find yourself outside of the test chambers.  But really these are minor and forgivable.The Portal 2 single-player is an enjoyable ride that will make you laugh in between twisting your brain with puzzles and twisting the plot. The environment, ideas and characters remind me of BioShock's Rapture and Andrew Ryan, but the Portal series stands on it's own.  There is truly nothing out there like it today.\"

One of the most hilarious, clever, and original stories ever penned for the medium in addition to being one of the most seamless gameplay experiences ever produced. There is no distinction between gameplay and narrative which lends itself not only to developing complete, lengendary characters right before your eyes but to experiencing an environment that shifts and changes just as organically as those personalities trapped with you at Aperture. The finely honed atmosphere is abound with tense electronic pulses and physical effects that at times make you feel truly like the lab rat that you are. The beauty of the series, however, is is ever-encroaching feeling of control held within the player despite your arsenal never truly heralding new gadgets. It's the real human sense of inevitable freedom and escape powered by ingenuity that drives the player to complete each puzzle, a trait that Chell is indeed replete with. The main campaign is short and linear (8 hours), but so expertly crafted and dense with character that repeat playthroughs are as necessary as watching BTTF for the 20th time 25 years after it's release.

2011,Portal 2,"A masterpiece erected over its predecessor's foundations, Portal 2 stands as a monument to game design.  Brilliant voice acting, wry, understated humor, and a plot that manages to provide back-story even as it surprises with twists and provides context for new mechanics all serve to elevate the brilliant core gameplay, culminating in a experience best summarized as What A Sequel Should Be.A masterpiece erected over its predecessor's foundations, Portal 2 stands as a monument to game design.  Brilliant voice acting, wry, understated humor, and a plot that manages to provide back-story even as it surprises with twists and provides context for new mechanics all serve to elevate the brilliant core gameplay, culminating in a experience best summarized as What A Sequel Should Be.  The game starts in familiar territory, reacquainting the player with the portal gun and slowly layering in the complexity.  The first couple hours bring players up to speed with the original's features, but by the end of the game you'll be working with launchers, turrets, barriers made of light, tractor beams, and several flavors of gel: one that reduces friction, one that amplifies jumps, and one that paints surfaces, allowing portals to be fired on anything it touches.  Puzzles are elegant and satisfying throughout the game, but those near the end are particularly imaginative and challenging.  Equally important to the game's success is the addition of a versatile cooperative mode, wherein players take on the role of a pair of testing robots, each armed with its own portal gun, and team up to solve puzzles that would be impossible to solve alone.  Levels are accessed through a central hub divided into 5 sets of rooms, the first four focusing on specific concepts and mechanics in a manner similar to the single-player campaign's progression, with the 5th appearing once the first four have been mastered.  From the hub, players can access and replay any level they've completed, or pick up where they left off, and returning to the hub is as simple as pausing the game and selecting the correct option.  The cooperative puzzles are at least as engaging than those found in the single-player mode, and though the plot is essentially a monologue by GLaDOS peppered with context-sensitive commentary, the ride is nevertheless enjoyable.That said, however, Portal 2 is not for everyone.  An inordinate amount of negative user reviews are surfacing here, most of which give the game a ""0"" for being too hard, too short, not pretty enough, or as a blatant and admitted effort to counteract the ""fan boys"" and produce an average that better reflects what it ""should.""  For the sake of clarity, I'd like to address a few of those issues below, from a different, and, I hope, less biased perspective.  In my estimation, Portal 2 is far from a mediocre game, but most people will either love it or (apparently) hate it.  And so, a disclaimer:FPS fans accustomed to more conventional titles -- Halo, Call of Duty, BattleField, and all the many copycats -- may find Portal 2's focus on platforming and solving puzzles to the exclusion of explosive eye-candy and wanton violence a bit off-putting.  Similarly, solitary gamers and those conditioned for competitive multiplayer may find the game a little short.  The single-player campaign takes about 6 hours to complete, with the multiplayer campaign (Split Screen, System Link, or over Xbox Live) taking about as long, assuming the player plays each level once and only once.  Resultantly, those without a friend to play with and lacking Xbox Live may feel short-changed, and players expecting an endless online frag-fest with every game that supports online multiplayer will find themselves similarly disappointed.  All of the above is doubly true for people with a poor sense for spatial relationships, and those suffering from what I'll diplomatically call a ""problem-solving deficiency;"" you don't have to be a rocket scientist to play Portal 2, but most people will occasionally need to stop and think about what they're doing -- particularly towards the end.Portal 2 is a fantastic game in every way, but isn't for everyone.  If you'd really rather not think while playing video games, look elsewhere.  Similarly, if you're going to play each level once and be done with the game -- particularly if you don't subscribe to Xbox Live -- there are many titles that have longer narratives.  However, most players will find the game undeniably unique and tremendously enjoyable, and many will play through a second, or third time -- particularly with the introduction of the flexible co-op mode.  I'd recommend those hesitant to buy at least rent the game  before dismissing it -- most will, I think, find themselves pleasantly surprised.  Portal 2 is one of the treasures of this console generation, and will be played long after most of its competition has been replaced and forgotten.\"

2011,Portal 2,"Let me start off by expressing my shock toward the negative reviews I've seen. Now look, the game is not without it's flaws, but few games deserve a 1.

Now look, the game is not without it's flaws, but few games deserve a 1. I would only give a game a 1 if I bought it, loaded it up, and it came up as a screen that said ""Haha, you just paid $50 for NOTHING"". I can sort of understand the middling scores, since I can see some of the frustration with certain elements, but frankly, all this rage-posting pissed me off enough to score the game a perfect 10 when I probably would have just given it an 8 or 9, just to offset the people who think that this excellent game deserves a 1 for their stupid complaints, which I shall discredit in a way that also shares my own feelings.1) ""The game is too short"". This is probably the most common and valid reason I've seen, so I'll tackle this one first. First of all, anyone who claims that they beat this in four hours is either lying, has no concept of time, or enjoyed playing so much that they lost track of time. This game cannot be beaten in four hours on the first run. I'm sorry, I don't believe you. The people who say eight hours, I'll believe you, at least for the solo campaign. It took me about 10 hours all in all and I only got stuck about 4 times. Even so, on a speed run, I could see someone completing it in 6 hours if they REALLY knew what they were doing and never faltered. 4 hours on a first play-through is complete bull.That being said, it could be argued that 6-10 hours for a campaign is still very short, particularly with little replayability and at full price. I would argue that we generally pay $20-30 for a two hour movie. Two movies would cost about the same and that's only 4 hours. So 6-10 hours of gameplay can be worth the price.I say ""can"" be worth the price, because it depends entirely on how GOOD the gameplay is. If it was 6-10 hours of BAD gameplay, I could understand the complaints. However, the fact that people complained that it was too short implies that they ENJOYED the time they spent with it SO MUCH that the brief time they spent with it simply wasn't enough. So why are these people giving it a 1? If you gave it a 1, I would expect that you hated the gameplay, but if that were so, why complain that it was too short? It's like complaining that your friend's waffles taste terrible while also complaining that they didn't make enough of the terrible waffles to satisfy you. It makes you sound like an idiot.So to summarize on this point, I can understand people who think the game is too short to justify the cost of the game. I kind of agree in theory, but frankly, the quality of the gameplay makes up for this to me. Plus, there is SOME replayability. Even if you don't want to play the co-op campaign (which is a lot of fun), you can replay the game with developer commentary (a concept that I think more games should implement because it is fascinating), you can achievement hunt, and, well, you can play the game again. It's a great game well worth playing more than once. I mean, if you have no intention of ever playing the game again, just rent it! That's what rental stores are for. Anyway, enough of that.2) ""First Day DLC! SACRILEGE!"" Anyone who complains about first-day DLC needs to understand two things. First, the DLC in question is purely cosmetic. If you don't want it, you don't need to get it. Second, you need to understand that the AAA video game market is having a hard time dealing with rentals and resellers. By including first day DLC that you can get for free by pre-order it, they encourage their customers to buy it retail. It's an advantage for buying it at full cost instead of waiting for it to be available used. It can be frustrating when this tactic is employed on something significant, but in this case, it was just for silly pointless things, so your argument is moronic and also doesn't reflect the actual content of the game at all.3) ""The Xbox Version got shafted"" I actually kind of agree, but you guys act like that's Valve's or the game's fault. No. It's the Xbox's fault. You think they dumbed down the graphics because they have some kind of vendetta or because they're lazy? No, it's because the Xbox is simply not as powerful as the PS3 or a personal computer and because Microsoft has to make everything proprietary. So yes, it is the weakest release out of all of them, but the most you will notice is reduced graphics and the lack of a bundled PC version. And frankly, if you picked up Portal 2 for the graphics, you are an idiot, and if you want to play it on your PC, you should just buy the PC version.Disappointment in one or two aspects of the game is no reason to act like the game gave you cancer. It is a great game. It may be shorter than some retail games, but the content you get during that gameplay is far better than what you would get from most other games\"

Single player is hand's down the best experience I've had in a video game, ever. Though it may be linear, it's what the game is. Multiplayer has more in-depth and gripping value than the previous and still continues to be a modest asset to the game. I give 10/10s to games that are perfect or nearly perfect.

2011,Uncharted 3,"This game is the PS3 game of the year in my opinion. Not only does it have one of the, if not the best, graphics I've ever seen in PS3 and superb voice acting, sound and music, it also has a great story and gameplay that really supplements those to come to life. Some people complain about gameplay, complaining that the platforming is boring, aiming is awkward, and bad AI. DO NOT LISTEN TOThis game is the PS3 game of the year in my opinion. Not only does it have one of the, if not the best, graphics I've ever seen in PS3 and superb voice acting, sound and music, it also has a great story and gameplay that really supplements those to come to life. Some people complain about gameplay, complaining that the platforming is boring, aiming is awkward, and bad AI. DO NOT LISTEN TO THEM. 1. PLATFORMING IS WHAT DEFINES UNCHARTED SERIES: Yeah, I can get frustrated at times. But never once have I ever thought it was boring and repetitive. Saying platforming in Uncharted series is boring and easy is like saying gliding in the air for Arkham City or walking in FPS games boring and easy. 2. SAYING AIMING IS BAD IS DOWNRIGHT LUDICROUS: What did you honestly expect, FPS? This is as good a third-person shooting I have ever seen in video game from any consoles or PC. If it's too silky for you, you can tone down the sensitivity in the option, no problem. 3. AI IS NOT BAD: There are a very few times that I said, ""Wow, I can get away with this?"" But I have found no games that are completely free of that question. There were times from UC1 and 2 that I felt pretty frustrated, but it wasn't because of cheapness, but of my own ineptitude. 4. LINEARITY IS HOW UNCHARTED SERIES IS SUPPOSED TO BE: This game is linear, no doubt about that. But I would rather have a story AND gameplay be linear and have fun playing every minute of that, than say, having a Fallout 3-kind of non-linearity. Fallout 3 was a great game, but UC series is obviously different to the very core. Now my own POSITIVE. 1. SEARCHING FOR TREASURE IS A GREAT TIME-SPENDER: I played this game for 5 hours, and I don't think I am a quarter way there, searching for treasure and being mesmerized by in-game environments. There are 101 (including strange relic) that you have to collect, and without guides, you will spend abundance of time happily searching for treasures. 2. AMAZING GRAPHICS, SOUNDS, VOICE ACTING, AND MUSIC: This has always been the biggest strength of Uncharted series, and it actually improves on Uncharted 2, which I didn't believe was possible. 3. GREAT SINGLE PLAYER EXPERIENCE: Heavy on cut-scenes, but really a gaming moment that you will cherish for years. 4. CO-OP MODE: I kinda think this will be ignored from gamers due to the greatness of the single and multi-player modes, but make sure you check it out. 5. GREAT MULTIPLAYER MODE: Some ignorant people who gave out 0 completely neglected to mention the awesome multiplayer mode. Not only are there eye candies like customization, it is...just indescribably great. This simply is the best third-person shooting multiplayer experience out there, and it really got better from UC2 and beta. New perk and point system is great, giving you advantage for playing more, even if you stink. ONE NEGATIVE, there IS an abundance of cut scenes and movie. Although amazing and epic, I wish I could spend a little (actually, I wish it never ended) more time playing this once-in-a-lifetime single-player experience that most would not forget in years. BIG STEP FORWARD, to contrast one particular reviewer, FOR NAUGHTY DOG AND UNCHARTED FRANCHISE.\"

The second review, however, has clearly been written by some bored ""troll"" who has nothing better to do. The fact that he/she highlights all the good points of the game, which have clearly been lifted straight from reviews, but gives the game 0/10 on the basis that it is 'linear' shows that not only do they not own the game, but they have never played an Uncharted game in their lives. The fact that they also call it 'basically an interactive movie' also shows that they have no idea what they are talking about. This is NOTHING like Heavy Rain. Fundamentally, all great single player games are pretty much interactive movies when it comes down to it anyway, aren't they?Perhaps this irked reviewer gave Uncharted: Drake's Deception a 0/10 because they do not own a PS3 and is suffering from a case if sour grapes. Considering this is said to be one of, if not THE greatest games ever made, I do not blame them. But seriously, get a life. My advice is to ask mummy nicely to raise your allowance, save up your pocket money and invest in a PS3 slim. Until then, Batman: Arkham City should be able to satisfy your needs and will also be a better use of your free time.\"

Cut scenes interrupt gameplay so frequently that they would have been better off making this a movie, especially as the gameplay isn't much to write home about.

The new melee systems' only purpose seems to be to get you shot as you flail away, counter and break holds for what seems like an eternity (at least the old system was quick). The gun play feels the same as it ever did, only enemies seem to have developed an immunity to bullets, showing little to no reaction when hit, and that's not counting the  all to frequent 'heavies' that have literally been designed as bullet sinks.The story starts off well enough, but quickly devolves into the usual race to the lost city, and while there is an attempt to add drama and feeling part way through all that is lost the second Drake picks up a new gun and begins gunning down bad guys and making impossible jumps as if it was just another day at the office. Levels are as linear as ever, which wouldn't be such a bad thing, but you move between locations so frequently that despite the sprawling vistas most levels can't help but feel small and forgettable. Puzzles are also as simple as ever, but unlike in Among Thieves they are at least mercifully quick to solve.I didn't play the multiplayer (couldn't be bothered putting in the PSN Pass code), but the single player lasted just over 8 hours on hard for a first run, after which I decided to play Drakes Fortune again to see if my memories of it where only rose colored or if they where actually real; they are real. As a big fan of Uncharted: Drakes Fortune I couldn't help but be disappointed with Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, and while I feel that Uncharted 3: Drake Deception is better overall than 2, it is also in some ways worse (melee system) and doesn't hold a candle to the original.\"

Naughty Dog: learn the difference between millimetres and metres, please.A recent reviewer here commented that ""the 'cinematic gameplay' takes control away from the player and even adds movement to the character that's not coming from player input"". There's no better way of putting it. What's the point of buying a game if half the time its playing you, rather than the other way around? Half the time the engine's just timing how quickly you pull down on the joystick before deciding whether to play the 'live' of 'die' cut-scene. The most extraordinary thing is that UC2 (an incredible game) had these issues, but only to a fraction of the same degree. How is it possible they've been amplified rather than further reduced in the upgrade? Rhetorical question: it's been rushed to market of course. You watch the User Metascore plummet as more players start to wake up to this.\"
2011,Uncharted 3,"It really pains me to write this as Uncharted 2 was one of my favourite games of all time but Uncharted 3 is not even close to its equal.  Even the original Uncharted happens to be more fun as I had been playing it the week before to prepare for this.To summarise, nothing in Uncharted 3 is done better than any of the previous game except for the graphics for obvious reasons but graphicsIt really pains me to write this as Uncharted 2 was one of my favourite games of all time but Uncharted 3 is not even close to its equal.  Even the original Uncharted happens to be more fun as I had been playing it the week before to prepare for this.To summarise, nothing in Uncharted 3 is done better than any of the previous game except for the graphics for obvious reasons but graphics do not maketh the game.  Possibly the multiplayer too but I don't really care about that.  Uncharted for me has always been about cinematic single player.  Without having spoilers, the story is worse than both previous Uncharted games as many plot threads remain unresolved and the game ends on one of the biggest anti-climaxes I have ever seen in a game.  The main villain managed to be even more boring than Lazarovic which I kinda thought amazing because he was pretty generic.  The pacing is worse than both games and it will take nearly a couple of hours before you even get to shoot anything which in a 6.5 hour game (yes, shorter than both previous games) is pretty awful.  The shooting appears to have changed for the worse being incredibly laggy and making long distance combat nearly impossible.  It's quite nasty having to shoot the armoured guys walking towards you when you have to get numerous headshots to take down one of them and the game won't let you aim properly.  Speaking of, the game continuously likes to spam these guys at you as well as guys with sniper rifles or rocket launchers where they were few and far between in the original games to get you to change your strategy a little.  The change means that often you deaths are the result of having 3 guys firing rocket launchers right at you the moment you poke your head around a corner.Melee combat takes far too long to beat people and the game seems to be reluctant to let you get out of melee mode with the result that you quickly get shot dead because you couldn't run away.It should be mentioned however that the visuals are excellent and the music is very good at getting your heart racing when doing a cinematic move.Overall I was extremely disappointed with Uncharted 3.  My experience was mostly made of cheap deaths and a story that failed to soften the blow.  I would have returned it but because of the online pass I wouldn't have been able to get all my money back.  Seeing as how the majority of people like it, it may be enjoyed by you but there's the risk you may be disappointed like I was.  Buy with caution.\"
2011,Uncharted 3,"Let's get this out of the way first: Graphically UC3 is not what I was expecting. Look closely and you can see that draw distances are actually poor and detail diminishes quickly with distance. The colours are too saturated and, in some cases, I believe this is what leads to the feeling of having stunning graphics. NPCs are really poorly detailed and would be more at home in SIMS 3. OnceLet's get this out of the way first: Graphically UC3 is not what I was expecting. Look closely and you can see that draw distances are actually poor and detail diminishes quickly with distance. The colours are too saturated and, in some cases, I believe this is what leads to the feeling of having stunning graphics. NPCs are really poorly detailed and would be more at home in SIMS 3. Once Drake is standing next to an NPC the difference in the amount of detail between the two really hits home. In narrow areas, and while climbing, the camera struggles to find a suitable angle leading to some awkward up close shots of Drake. Combat is very stiff and similar to that of the previous two iterations, with nothing new at all here. The story itself is heavily cliched and probably the most linear game I've ever played: In some cases, once you've passed a certain point, it's not even possible to go back, so make sure you have all the collectibles before you take your next step. I finished the single campaign in one night with the game set to hard. I'll start again  tonight on crushing. Multiplayer's not possible tonight as PSN is down - can you imagine if that had happened on the day after launch of Gears? Anyway, I don't believe this game's here for the multiplayer - there are only two trophies for this. All in all a purely predictable game with graphics that are good but don't aim for realism. Apart from the new (but again, predictable) environments this is Uncharted 2.5 in all but name and not worth the price tag, especially for the collectors edition.\"
2011,Uncharted 3,"I wish I could give this game multiple scores. Why? This game is easily a 10 if your not shooting. The shooting mechanics might have been tolerable in past games, but it's simply bad now. The AI is bad in the shooting situations, both enemy and friendly. The aim assist and sensitivity sucks no matter what your settings. This all makes me very sad because of how good everything else is. TheI wish I could give this game multiple scores. Why?

Heck even the melee combat is decent and it'd probably seem better if Batman wasn't so fresh in my mind. But I simply can't get around the fact that a big portion of this game is shooting. Even if you successfully manage to stealth your way through some of the areas there's still plenty of it and its too unbearably bad and frustrating.\"
2011,Uncharted 3,"From the start of this game to the end I was amazed by how good the graphics were, it was just visually stunning. Running through the streets of London at the start made me question if I was playing a computer game or watching a film.  Some people have said the story was poor and the game short and while the game is perhaps a little short when you compare it to Drake 2, but if you compare it to the first one there is certainly a lot more game play there. The story as well is entertaining and intriguing enough to keep you entertained.For me this games let down its is controls, all to often you find drake doing things you didn't want or ask him to do. The hand to hand cant reach the levels Arkham city achieved and the gun play still just some how feels untested.However despite these niggles this is still one of the most outstanding games to come out on the PS3, the levels on the boat possibly being the stand out moment of the whole game. If you can get past the control issues it is a pleasure to play it.\"

Another Uncharted game this generation without a noticeable engine upgrade would be a disappointment. That said, UC3 is still an unmatched technical achievement. I'm not sure what it would have taken to turn me off of this game but Naughty Dog is in no danger here. This is a perfect example of how all the pieces can come together to deliver an experience that oozes quality and polish. Personally I would love to see the next UC game take some risks. Maybe even jump genres entirely. As for UC3, it doesn't get any better.\"

The last 3 hours or so you have none. I was waiting for one final big one and it never came. The ones it did have were great but I felt UC2 had some better ones. Also the end I love and hate. Quite good and not annoying like UC2s but then again there wasn't much play more of a guided movie. That and the occasional stuck in an unfair firefight spot but that happens in lots of games. Other than my nit picks though the levels are incredible, the story is great as always and the graphics deliver in detail and smart design. I won't ruin it but the faces if you have played are my favorite, took a bit of starring to figure them out but once I did I thought now that's awesome! Every part of this game has insane detail and although I hope from here on out they start to open up the climbing and the routes to have a more open approach (even if they take this mechanic to a new series, who knows if this one is done or not) the climbing parts were much more varied and the objects much more natural. A bit of color hints but for the most part you felt like you were climbing on stuff instead of ""this yellow ledge"". I don't have much more to say without giving spoilers besides buy this game. oh and no worries on multiplayer, it's fantastic too. Opinions can be made in comparison to other shooters and such but this one definitely has it's own flavor and style to make it compete for my online hours. The addition of player customization and emblem creation are huge to me as a professional designer. May not be as big of points for others but I like to make things unique and my own and I love that they added this. Tons of upgrades and unlock and plenty of levels to keep you interested. The levels themselves are varied with their own unique situations I guess I would say which definitely makes you feel like they aren't just another map. Some are better than other of course but that's all opinion. To wrap up overall great game with minor gripes but only because it makes you wanting more. Covers all the essential, great gameplay, great story, great multiplayer. you will play again and again.\"

2011,Uncharted 3,"It's hard to say this but overall I enjoyed Uncharted 2 more when it came out. The 2nd one was a much larger leap forward from the first Uncharted game. The 3rd one is not as much of a leap forward like the 2nd one was to the 1st one. The story also follows a similar formula like its predecessor.

Scoring wise Uncharted 3 may be the best when it's all said and done, just the leap forward wasn't as major if you know what I mean. And in my opinion nothing tops the train sequence in Uncharted 2. Remember riding and taking out bad guys from the jungle to the snowy mountains in one scene? That's the pinnacle of video gaming right there! But that's not to say other people may have differing opinions on the awesome sequences in the 3rd one.\"

Now, we have Uncharted 3: Drake\s Deception. It\s a solid entry in the series, having many similarities with \Among Thieves\, but bringing enough to the table to stand on its own.The graphics in Uncharted 3 are absolutely breathtaking. Easily the best on any console to date. The lighting is gorgeous and spot-on. The textures are pitch perfect, whether it\s grains of sand, Drake\s clothing, or shrubbery, it\s all stunning. The game is a sheer pleasure just to look at and drool over. The sound in Uncharted 3 is also a pleasure. The musical score for each area and cut scene document the current situation well, providing good production values to the cinematic experience. Uncharted 3\s voice acting is very well-done, as usual, with all the same voice actors as in previous installments.Uncharted 3: Drake\s Deception\s story is great, with well executed cut scenes, and moving along at a steady pace. The writers of Uncharted have really made a unique and attractive experience, with each game remaining the same at the core, with an almost identical premise, but it\s the gameplay that switches things up enough to make it fresh. I feel strongly about the next Uncharted entry though, I believe it will make or break the series, there are some things that just absolutely have to change every now and then. The game\s length is respectable as well. It\s not too short and not too long. All of the DLC being released should feed the appetite of hardcore gamers though. The multiplayer remains one of the Uncharted series\ most attractive offers, as there is never a dull moment while playing online. The gameplay is essentially the same as Uncharted 2, with not a whole lot of change. There are more types of guns and weapons, more diversity, such as horseback riding and a lot more climbing and swinging. The controls can feel clunky at times, and you may make mistakes accidentally that become frustrating, but it\s still solid.Overall, Uncharted 3: Drake\s Deception is a worthy entry in Sony\s premier series, with many new aspects and elements added to it\s arsenal. The main issue with the game is that many players may feel like they\ve been her before, since it has many similarities to its predecessor, \Among Thieves\, but new story and new gameplay elements should override its faults and deliver an unforgettable experience. The diversity in its gameplay is what makes the game and series stand out, with a lot of shooting, running from disaster, flying planes, riding on boats and horses, and so on. In the end, Uncharted 3: Drake\s Deception delivers with a top-notch story, stellar gameplay, great voice acting, gorgeous visuals and solid controls, making it a must-own for Playstation 3 owners.\"

But the best part of the game is the art direction. There are varied, stunning landscapes that really immerse the player. The camera angles are stunning and make it feel like a movie. Truly a great game."
2011,Uncharted 3,"The king of puzzle games.It's full of action , parkour, puzzles  and a great story. The characters are strong and Nate is more badass than ever.The game is more mature, has a lot of weapons. I highly recommend it to everyone"
2011,Uncharted 3,"Awesome culmination of a very successful series that is sure to come back sometime and I'll play again . One thing I regret it not quite perfect ending to this series . With so many cut scenes throughout the game , I would expect better cinematic endings but that's just my opinion ."

2011,Uncharted 3,"The game begins two years after the previous game, Drake and Sully enter a pub in London to make a deal with a man named Talbot.

Outside the Pub Nate and Sully are shot by Katherine Marlowe after being subdued byThe game begins two years after the previous game, Drake and Sully enter a pub in London to make a deal with a man named Talbot. He is looking to buy Nate\s ring belonging to his ancestor Sir Francis Drake. A fight starts after Nate and sully accused Talbot of giving them counterfeit money for the ring. Outside the Pub Nate and Sully are shot by Katherine Marlowe after being subdued by Charlie Cutter, Talbot\s cohort.A flashback brings back the player 20 years before the pub fight where find a 15 years old Nathan Drake exploring a museum in Cartagena, Colombia in search of Sir Francis Drake\s ring. Nate is caught by Marlowe who is also looking for the ring and she was confronted to Nathan who was able to steal the ring already. Marlowe is threatening Nathan to give her the ring using a gun but a young Sully comes to the rescue and gives Nathan the opportunity to escape. Nate is caught by Marlowe\s henchman on a rooftop, but Sully arrives just in time to rescue Nate from the agents and take the boy on as a protg.When the flashback is over, the player returns to present times where we see that the meeting was an elaborate plan set up by Nate and Sully to try and find Marlowe. They followed Marlowe\s car to an underground library where they manage to retrieve T.E. Lawrence\s note book and a Map showing Francis secret travels to Arabia where he was asked by Queen Elizabeth to search for the lost city of Ubar.GameplayIn the game the player controls Nathan Drake, the animation of Nathan is very well done since he can react to a number of different circumstances according to his surroundings and is able to walk, run, jump, sprint, climb and can scale narrow ledges as well as perform acrobatics actions. Drake has the ability to uses every weapons in the game but he can only carry two fire-arms, one single handed, one two handed and 4 grenades. Drake can cover behind wall and use his aimed or blind-fire to kill enemies near him. Sneaking is also part of the game, sometimes the player has the opportunity the take out his s opponent without alerting them and kill them with one blow. Some areas of the game will require the player to solve puzzles with the use of drake\s journal, which will provide clues but no answers to help solve them.There is also a multiplayer mode in Uncharted 3 similar to the second game which includes s competitive and a cooperative play mode.ConclusionI have to say I am not surprised of the goodness of this game, I played the second one and I just loved it. This game has it all, puzzle, gunfights, adventure, good story, good graphics, good gameplay, I could go on but the list would take a few pages. This game is a GameXplicit must have, well done Naughty Dog!Written by Mikael Dahan\"

2011,Uncharted 3,"Mindblowing visuals. I cannot believe how crazy some of the locations are, and you won't either. Sadly, the story feels rushed towards the end, but that didn't stop me from enjoying the story in a whole. Uncharted 3 adds great lore and backstory to Nathan's early years, and that is done masterfully."

I was wondering how I could finish this game if the starting is already wearing me down but lucky for me I finished all 22 chapters and I will say it's one the best PS3 gaming experience I'll ever have (although the game is just way too short for my liking), yes the aiming is at times frustrating but it was never bad enough to discourage for enjoying the game... while I do think the game holds many flaws but minor ones, now I'll await a good multi-player from my cousin XD.\"

Naughty Dog shows again how the Uncharted franchise is the jack of all trades, with phenomenal set-piece moments, gameplay, graphics, audio, characters and so much more. The writing is clever and humorous while still presenting realistic human interactions. The environments will astound you with their beauty, with the only graphical flaws being the awful shadows (relative to PC graphics). Facial animations not only look beautiful, but convince you that the characters are real human beings. The gameplay this time around has a more weighty feel to it and Drake is a bit more unwieldy to control. Whether or not you like this change is up to you, as I personally feel like Drake is more human and adds a bit of welcome challenge to the game. If you have ever played Killzone 2 and 3, imagine that in reverse as Killzone 3 removed the gravity effect but Uncharted 3 adds it. Otherwise, everything else about this game is impeccable. If you have a PS3, you owe it to yourself to purchase this game as soon as possible.\"

2011,Uncharted 3,"Letting it sink a little, i should probably shorten and change my review to this: I love Uncharted so much that the lesser story (than previous uncharted games) is a notable letdown. If you watch the developer commetary after finishing the game.. makes perfect sense. Hope they don't do that for the next game :/"

The game makes more use of physics than the previous title and does so in wonderful fashion... the physics based gameplay in this game is probably the most impressive I've seen since Half-Life 2. The newly added melee system does a great job of complimenting gun combat and combat in general now is more challenging, due to more aggressive enemies. There are more stealth parts to the game but unfortunately, it's rather difficult to clear an area without being seen. The story is another tale of treasuring hunting but this time, focuses more on Drake and the lovable Sully, including bits of their past. But what unfortunately, ND felt it necessary to tweak the aiming system from previous game and it simply doesn't feel as smooth as the previous games. It takes quite a bit of time to get used to. And many of the events become a bit to cliched, like crumbling floors and falling ladders. Overall, this is a great game but it falls just short of the perfectly paced Uncharted 2. Multiplayer, however, is the highlight in this game. It's been significantly improved since the last game and is simply more fun so the game will keep you busy for months after you finish the single player mode.\"
2011,Uncharted 3,"Uncharted 2 was, in my opinion, as close to perfect as you can possibly be, which thereby makes it almost impossible to make a follow up with the same level of excellence.

This game sports all the same action, platforming and story telling that made previous entries so enticing and it is all presented with the same high production values we have come to expect. Despite falling victim to the ""more-of-the-same"" syndrome, the game still manages to be thoroughly entertaining from beginning to end. Where the game differs is in its extra focus on hand-to-hand combat which I felt was often misplaced and underdeveloped. My favorite addition to the game however is the Free-For-All multiplayer mode, most modern shooters rely only on team-based multiplayer these days so it was very refreshing to see this alternative.\"
