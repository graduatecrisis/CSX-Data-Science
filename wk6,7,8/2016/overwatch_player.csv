Additionally, defending teams get a 60 second head start which allows them to easily camp the initial attacking team's base with impunity.- 20Hz tick rate and predictive ""favor the shooter"" netcode that leads to lots of cheap deaths and kills. Turn off your kill cam unless you like to rage.I scoff at the very notion that this will ever be a competitive shooter. We're already watching competitive outlets outright ban maps like 2 Control Point and community map voting rules have effectively banned King of the Hill maps. No custom servers, no server browser... this is a casual game through and through, designed solely for people to pick up and play a few matches then put down. If ever anyone needed proof of this, just look at how Blizzard was quick to address an animation cancel for Widowmaker that promoted skill. (Third post time is a charm, I guess.)…"

There is no SKILL in lucky timing.+ Some classes have weapons which literally require you to aim within 75 degrees of an enemy to hit them. It's a little ridiculous for a ""Skilled"" FPS.…"

7,"A serie with alot of hype, mainly because it is a Blizzard game with their ""Blizzard polish"". This game is fun, but won't have a long longevity for me after spending a decent amount of hours(around 100) playing this game. I will explain it as short as possible for the people who wants quick and short reviews to compare it with each other:EDIT: It isn't as short as I thought it wouldA serie with alot of hype, mainly because it is a Blizzard game with their ""Blizzard polish"". This game is fun, but won't have a long longevity for me after spending a decent amount of hours(around 100) playing this game. I will explain it as short as possible for the people who wants quick and short reviews to compare it with each other:EDIT: It isn't as short as I thought it would be, so my appologize.Positive:- It's a fun and solid teambased shooter when you're new to this game:It's a fun and fresh experience, when you're learning each maps and characters. Every character is unique, but also easy to learn/understand. The maps are also well designed enough for each character.This is subjective and a negative for some gamers: People who wants complex characters won't get what they want. So this could be a negative. For example, Mei is a hero with a tier 4 difficutly, yet she doesn't feel that different in difficulty compared to a tier 1 character like Bastion.- You can switch characters during game and also able to play as the same heroes as your teammates::So you and your team can accustom to how your opponents are playing incase you have chosen the wrong hero. Or you can experiment by changing your heroes till you find the synergy to win the game. Or go crazy and have fun with weird hero combinations(even though this may be disrespectfull for your opponent).- Teamplay is pretty important in the game:For example, your health won't regenerate, hence you need a healer. However, you don't need a healer if you don't want to play that way, since there are healing items lying around the map with a respawn/cooldown timer. This will slow down your teamplay if everyone is scattered around to find the healing items and heal themself. Each hero has their role(attackers, defenders, supporters and healers).- Game isn't technically impressive. However, we're gamers and the visual presentation and performance is nice and that's what matters:It looks like a Pixar movie(not hitting that lvl, but the style is similiar) and the gameplay is fluent. Especially on the console, since it's pretty hard for developers to hit the 60fps on consoles and Overwatch is one of those game hitting the 60fps with a dynamic resolution.Negatives:- Short longevity for some gamers:This doesn't apply to everyone ofcourse. But the amount of content is pretty small for a priced game. This game is only PvP and while the game is fun to play, it's all you will get(with the exception of future contents(but the question is, will that be enough)). All the heroes are unlocked and the maps. The only thing you will get are sprays, skins(some are interesting if I'm honest hehe), taunts, etc. As you may noticed, all the things I've mentioned doesn't add any value to the actual game, beside being aesthetic. All the character will play the same, meaning you won't be able to personalize your character like some other games do. Hence this longevity will be short after knowing how all your heroes plays and how to play in each maps. This is the main reason why I won't give this game a high score/perfect score like a 9 or 10.- The game isn't complete, since the competitive gamemode will come in the next update:Meaning, you're buying a game which isn't complete. Similiar towards SFV, but that one is far worse. This may be a trend in the future where publishers releases an incomplete game for the full price(sadly, I also bought this game, meaning I can't say much about this). Also another reason why I won't give this game an 8.Hence my final verdict being a 7. I hope you understand why I gave this a 7 and this is my personal opinion anyways for the people who disagrees :) 7 is a good game IMO, even though it isn't a 9 or a 10. Hope I helped some people with this review. And if you will buy this game or have bought this and still read this, because of curiosity:I hope you're enjoying your game and hope we will be teamed up and teamed against in Overwatch :PPS: Srry for my English.…"

For me, person who hates military shooters this title suits well. The game is very fast paced and there is always some action going on, which is great.Pros:- Pretty good and consistent artstyle- Cool heroes with distinct abilities- Fluid and polished combat- Simple to pick up, but has enough depth to not get bored quickly- Great performance even on older machines- Engaging gameplay centered on objectives.Pros:- Game suffers from not that good netcode with only ~20Hz tickrate- No ranked (competitive mode) on release (being reworked and patched in at a later date)- Hero stacking can be frustrating at timesOne more thing is that people complain about it's business model. Personally I like buy to play model, with some cosmetic micro-transaction. If this had pay-walls or grind-walls with f2p model, I would not even play it. I hate that in hearthstone and hate that in Heroes of the Storm. With Overwatch, you can take few months break and don't fall behind compared to other people - all heroes (including upcoming ones) are available right of the bat, same goes for maps and game modes and what not - basically all content, apart cosmetics (which is not any in-game advantage whatsoever).But this is fun game, especially to play with friends (but it's okay too when playing with random people). If you look for hardcore competitive game with advanced mechanics and lot of depth - this games is probably not for you, in other case - I can recommend it.UPDATE!!! (mostly about competitive mode)I initially gave it weak 8/10. But since Blizzard patched in competitive mode (aka ranked system) I've decided to update my review.Basically competitive mode is in broken state. There are serious bugs (or maybe design choice) related to how your rank progression is calculated. As notable example, if you win the competitive game, and there is a leaver (person who abandoned game), regardless if you are on affected team or not, in any winner gets barely no rank progress (in comparison on average it's more than 50% of rank progress, with a leaver it's less than 10%), but you always lose full amount of progress regardless if some leaver screws your game. 1week in, still no response on this issue. Additionally, people with 60% or greater winrate can fall in ranks just like that.Matchmaking is terrible, especially for solo people and small party groups. Most games are either you stomp the enemy or you are being stomped. Close games are scarce.The competitive mode is plagued with leavers (which can basically can leave as they please, because you have to abuse it to get even slightest penalty), griefers (who basically play the game their own way ignoring team's interest), trolls and all kind of people that will ruin you the fun of competing with other players.On top of that if game ends in draw, you basically play a coin flip, because draw is played on asymmetric map, where one side gets attack and other defense (that is not 50/50 chance to win).It's not a super competitive game when you go heavy try-hard mode, but competitive mode is competitive, even with casual aspects, but in current iteration it's absolutely broken and it will cause you only frustration due to multiple bugs and/or design flaws. Because the only long-term value is competitive mode (which should give you progression system and goals to achieve) and it's broken I'm changing my verdict from 8 to 5/10. Even if you look at this game more casually and intend to play just like 1-2 weeks per season, still some things can't be ignored and I eventually would not recommend it at this point.…"
2,"Overall disappointed in Blizzard. I really really wanted to give this game a chance.

I really really wanted to give this game a chance.   I have been a Blizzard fan since Warcraft 1 on PC...owning and playing every game they have released religiously.Overwatch has good character design, smooth game play, decent graphics on PC/PS4 but no innovative features or game modes that will pull me away from any of my top FPS/TPS games (old and new).   Overwatch is a simplified FPS compared to others and it's not necessarily a bad thing.  The maps are well designed for close quarter battles and the game doesn't drag long.I think the simplicity of it will draw new players to the genre so they can pick it up easily.   To me,  it seems like they made this game for beginners to the FPS genre.  Sure vets can still play it and have fun with the characters abilities but if you look at it overall it's not as FUN as it can and should be.It reminds me of the same thing they tried to do when they entered the MOBA genre with Heroes of the Storm.  They simplified it compared to other MOBA games but I got bored of it quickly.  Maybe I'm an old hardcore gamer and I want to get my money's worth.  But $60 is alot of money for a multiplayer only FPS game with only 2 modes  There's not even a campaign with all the story behind the characters.Star Wars Battlefront basically multiplayer only but Battlefront is a much better FPS.  Like AMAZING compared to boring Overwatch!  Plus, the 2 game modes of hold the area and move the convoy aren't really exciting at all to play.  Couldn't they think of something more creative?   Heck! The game modes in Unreal Tournament especially 2004 still blow the Overwatch away.  Unreal 2004 (and on) still has the most enjoyable and creative progression objectives like Assault, Onslaught, etc.    Instead of a boring hold this spot then protect this new spot or convey.  It would've helped Overwatch tremendously if they learned from the game modes of Call of Duty, Castle Wolfenstein, Unreal Tournament and not just copying mainly Team Fortress.   I would've gladly pay $60 for this multiplayer-exclusive FPS game if it had better modes and features.  For example, maybe with some maps or modes they could have a train fight scenario to find the bomb, destroy big turret by progressively completing objectives.   So Overwatch is just a plain shooter.  Nothing special at all.  You could play any sci-fi shooter of the past and still get the same experience but just without the awesome character design.Overwatch took some good ideas from some FPS but not enough to make it great.It's just a ""clone"" FPS with a gorgeous reskin of characters with special moves.I'm a big fan of Blizzard and have played all their games religiously and even own collector's edition of all the PC games (from Warcraft, Diablo, Starcraft and I even bought the Overwatch one).  But I'm sorry I have to give this one a bad rating.  Not sure who took over creative directing at Blizzard but this one is a fail to me.  It might do well for teeny-boppers and millenials that jump on the hype.  And most likely Blizzard will front a bunch of $million dollar tournaments because they can.  But that still doesn't help make this a great FPS.  It's below average to me.  Even Team Fortress and Counterstrike are more fun than this.   They may only have a few maps or modes but they were the originators and still the BEST.  Blizzard tried to copy them and some other FPS but ended up being flat in the end.…"

They're all pretty linear making the map a more or less negligible element of the match. There is no reward system that seems to drive you to play or achieve something.For me, the game feel unfinished. Like it's a late stage beta or something. There just isn't enough content to keep players hooked for a considerable period of time. Most players will burn out after a month or two.

Whut?Yeah, this game has potential, it has promise, but it also has a lot of problems too. Character balance is awful, fans of the game will tell you that it's an amazing game where being able to change your character means it's a constant game of rock paper scissors. That is until you realise that half a dozen characters in the game are both rock and paper, or scissors and rock, or even all three, when played by someone with a modicum of experience.Half objective based team shooter, half team deathmatch, the game shines when it is played like the former and results in pure frustration and anger because 2 or 3 people playing it like the latter can ruin any real sense of strategy or territorial control.But then the game clearly isn't set up to be a game of tactical nuance. Spawn times are almost non-existent meaning defenders are constantly able to defend, and maps are so poorly designed that they're either too open or too narrow.But ultimately (no pun intended?) what kills it for me are the one-two combos that many characters have that are nigh on impossible to counter without one of those rock and paper characters I previously mentioned. Roadhog's Chain and point blank shotgun blast will kill almost anyone in one shot after dragging them (with no counter and a stun) to right infront of him. McCree can stun you in place with a flashbang, unload his 6 shooter, roll for instant reload and shoot you for 6 against straight away. Mei only has to start hitting you with her stream of ice and, unless you have some kind of ""escape"" ability, you're going to be toast as she freezes you in place and then lines up a headshot while you can do nothing and kills you.This game is touted as supposedly being about being a ""Postive"" FPS, where people aren't downvoted or reported, where people are encouraged to commend people for achievements, where everyone gets ""elimination"" stats for having taken part in a kill. But at it's core it's a devious deathmatch game which rewards trolling behaviour by one player against another.But fans will tell you that there is depth and skill to this game, which may be true for Blizzard fans that have come from outside an FPS environment. For those of us that have been playing the genre for 20 years aren't seeing anything fundamentally new here, and what is new (the MOBA ability elements) are hamfistedly introduced without care for what makes MOBA games work... that good positioning and ancillary item use can counter and lessen the effects of people's abilities and ultimates, something entirely not present in this game.Over-hyped, this game could be mindless fun, but it's not even that right now.…"

Overwatch is another Blizzard title that is more like a mobile app than an actual multi platform game.Pros and cons:+ Not many bugs or stability issues, runs really well+ All characters are unlocked from the go so you can easily try your favorite hero+ Lots of different characters with different play styles+ Graphics are typical for Blizzard, game looks pretty nice and doesn't require you to have a beefy PC- Netcode is quite simply horrible- Servers seemingly don't boot players with extreme pings- Game is designed around countering heroes/teams rather than improving your skills- Many auto win mechanics that will net you easy cheap kills with a press of a button- Matchmaking right now is quite bad, most rounds are insanely unfair and end pretty fast with one team just steamrolling the other. I've only had a handful of rounds that felt balanced and played well.- Punishing for solo players- Only a few maps and game modes, game is very repetitive. After playing for about 10-15 hours you've already seen and experienced the entire game and it doesn't really offer variety since the maps always play exactly the same.- For 40€, you get a polished game worth about 10 hours of play time, most f2p titles can offer twice that, easily.- The game is constantly trying to guess where you're character is going to move because the tickrate is so low, so you will notice (at least I do, playing with 144hz @ 144+ fps) a lot of stuttering when moving as a fast character. To me this is really really annoying and I can't understand why this would be a thing in 2016.Conclusion:This is one of those games that feels like the designers were focusing on perfecting one aspect of the game and completely forgot about everything else. In traditional Blizzard manner, this game is pretty much bug/glitch free and runs really really well, performance wise. It is however very apparent that Blizzard has no experience making FPS games. The horrible netcode, cheesy free kill mechanics and lack of content really scream for f2p. I do understand the benefits of having a 40€ price, as it will discourage cheating and will eliminate any sort of pay-to-win model, but trying to justify that price for a multiplayer only title that has as much content as Dirty Bomb seems hard.Nevertheless, this will be a fun game to play with friends, for a while. I wouldn't pay full price for it unless they add more free content in the future. If you are an FPS games, this game is probably not for you, as it seems to be more aimed at the MOBA people out there. I've played a lot of games but I would consider myself mostly an FPS games, and I can safely say this game is definitely NOT aimed at players like myself.…"
0,"Let's start with the positive stuff.The gameplay of Overwatch is great.The maps, the heroes, the models, the abilities all play really fine. The world is rather mysterious, but thanks to the cinematic shorts, comics and other posts, it's actually quite cool for a Shooter. I want to love this game really, really hard.But I can't.First of all, the matchmaking!Blizzard isLet's start with the positive stuff.The gameplay of Overwatch is great.The maps, the heroes, the models, the abilities all play really fine. The world is rather mysterious, but thanks to the cinematic shorts, comics and other posts, it's actually quite cool for a Shooter. I want to love this game really, really hard.But I can't.First of all, the matchmaking!Blizzard is notorious for their incompetent matchmakers. Heroes of the Storm was a huge failure because of it, despite HOTS having pretty damn awesome gameplay and design, the cancer that was matchmaking proved to be fatal to the game. One would think that the company learned from its mistakes. Nope. The game throws everyone together. Seasoned, highly skilled tryhards who are in it for the win and teamplay, and useless, noobcake newbies who will pick a 3rd sniper to cement your team's failuire. The teams are rarely ever balanced. One team usually stomps the other. Virtually every single game is full of frustration and stress. I tried to cling onto hope so hard that I gave the game more than 50 hours played hoping that the matchmaking will get a bit better, but nope, it didn't. To make things worse, there is no ranked play. Why would any developer release a competitive team based game without ranked play? That's the point of the whole game. It's like, selling a car without a motor: ""Here's your car, we don't have your motor yet, but in the meantime you can sit in it, or you can pretend to dive it!""Did I mention high latency? In most online games I have 20-25 ms ping. In overwatch the lowest I've seen is 40-45, but it usually is 60-70.The server communicates with the clients 20.8 times per second. So, everything you do in the game happens on that other guy's monitor about 0,1 seconds later. That's a lifetime in a fast paced FPS shooter! You will get shot by snipers and everybody all the time despite the fact that you were already in cover on your machine. It's a joke.I played plenty of multiplayer FPS games in my life. I used to be a Quake1 player, touched Q3, Quake Live, the COD and Battlefield series, the UT series and so on, but those games were FUN. Overwatch has a much better gameplay, but the matchmaking nullifies every bit of that so hard that I have to arrive to the conclusion:I never had such an awful online experience in my life.…"

2,"Could've been a good f2p game you can enjoy with your friends. Instead it became a mediocre FPS with little to no content, minimal playerbase and the worst micro-transactions and loot systems you can think of."
4,"Pass on this. Nothing new except maybe the art style of the game is pretty good. Should have been a free to play game with the option to pay for the skins. Needed a single player mini campaign or something to add some story for each character. Multiplayer matches are quick and for the most part fun but it's get pretty boring quickly."
6,"Possibly one of the most over-hyped shooter ever released. You read many websites praising how awesome the beta was and then you get to game itself and you will realize there isnt much to be praised about overwatch.Game features 21 heroes with lots of unlockables. Each hero has an interesting passive and a set of cool abilities but many of heroes are either over-powered ATM or either orPossibly one of the most over-hyped shooter ever released. You read many websites praising how awesome the beta was and then you get to game itself and you will realize there isnt much to be praised about overwatch.Game features 21 heroes with lots of unlockables. Each hero has an interesting passive and a set of cool abilities but many of heroes are either over-powered ATM or either or with such a low skill cap they do an insane amount of damage which results in ez 1v3 in games. I feel like the game is not in a playbale estate and needs lots of re balancing in terms of abilities ratios.Secondly the game doesnt have much content. aside from tones of unlockables, maps and heroes will be summarized in about 1 hour. The rest of your time will be spent on playing the similar modes again and again. Although i should say the maps and their layers are awesome! may be one of the best map designs ever.But the actual concern for me comes in when you can switch heroes in the game. When such a features exist then what is the definition of mastering a certain hero or a roll. as far as I have played either no1 wants to support or we see 2 bastion in single game. I feel like in terms of choosing heroes the game should locks it for 1 choice and one champ per a game, this way the team will be enforced to a better team building and teamwork.Lastly, the game doesnt have much content, but I hope blizzard updates it with free new modes and maps and perhaps new heroes and features. After seeing what it has to offer the rest of your time will be spent on understanding maps, item locations and mastering a hero regarding their abilities in respect to the team and map itself. But I fink this will not be possible for every1 since the game allows you to switch freely between characters. Like i said this decision questions if mastering a hero or a certain roles matters at all. Perhaps only for team games, other than that the quick game mode of Overwatch is a chaotic and frustrating set of short gameplay which teaches you nothing and rewards you wit nothing as well. Other than this I will not recommend This game if you fink this will satisfy your love for MOBA games as a FPS shooter. Its a game with a very low skill cap IMO. As a person who has played League of legends for over 4 years with Master Tier, I am pretty sure I do have a good understanding of skill cap and over powered factors in respect to heroes.…"

After an opening scene lifted whole cloth from 'The Incredibles', you're tossed right into the game, which is essentially an arcade FPS. There is zero character backstory. There is zero character progression. You can unlock things for characters (skins, dialog options, etc) but you do so with random loot boxes. If you stick with a favorite character you will not unlock items for that character any faster. If you thought 'Evolve' and 'Rainbow Six Siege' were small games, then you'll be even more annoyed with this.The most galling part is that the character design and core gameplay are really well done (hence the 4). They couldn't have spent time on a story mode like in a fighting game, where you play through matches with bots to get each character's backstory? Nope. Supposedly Blizzard has already announced free DLC for this game, hopefully it's, I don't know, maybe the option to select what type of match you want to play?

See below)-Beautiful game design, smooth operation-Great and easy to use group featureCONS:-Horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, HORRIBLE map design. Perhaps some of the worst maps ever made into a shooter game can be found in Hanamura, Temple of Anubis and Volskaya Industries. These maps are comically easy to defend, and require a level of total and complete team competence to attack that is all but unheard of in a pub setting.-Similarly, cheese defense is way too easy and way too effective. Yes, heroes like Bastion and Torbjorn may be counterable in theory, but actually going out and breaking their line of defense on the game's atrocious maps is perhaps the hardest task I've ever come across in a video game-Overtime is similarly a very poor design. Losers become winners and winners become losers because of it. Often times in the control point modes, a team will hit 99% but they will not win because of their defenses finally cracking during the game's ludicrously rewarding overtime.-20 tick servers are awful, you will get hit around corners a lot-Because of the issues above, the game is about as competitive as a game of catch-low amounts of content but I'm not scoring on this because it's definitely going to change as the game evolvesOverall, I give overwatch's current state a 4/10. It isn't anything spectacular and is plagued by a number of nuisances that just aren't suitably beatable for pub play. That being said, it's a great amount of fun and it will definitely stick around for a while.…"

The graphics are gorgeous and the control is smooth and responsive. Finding a match is easy and quick usually. The characters designs are interesting and their powers are impactful and fun. Why is this game not a 10/10 like some of the critic reviews, you may be asking yourself.Overwatch has several shortcomings (knowing Blizzard these will be fixed in time) that hold it back from a full recommendation to all gamers. For one this game is only a multiplayer online shooter, so you are subject to other people's success and failure as much as your own and that can be frustrating at times, especially considering the amount of teamwork required. One guy who refuses to change classes to help the team can lose you the game. If no one wants to play tank or healer, well, good luck winning. Also, there a decent amount of maps, but the game could certainly use more.If you're not the type of FPS fan that likes to like of things like strategy and meta, than this may not appeal to you. If you're very competitive, this may not appeal to you, as you can only control 1/6 of the outcome of the game, unless you make a team with your friends. Finally if you want a story mode or something novel other than standard multiplayer matches you can find elsewhere you may be disappointed.People that love online competitive TEAM shooters, will love this game, but many people will get bored quickly as there isn't a whole lot of modes (yet) or things you haven't seen before. Its solid and very well made, as is tradition with Blizzard, but it's lacking reasons for FPS vets to change over from there game of choice other than being a fun, by the numbers experience.

That's pretty impressive considering how the market have been treating launches lately.Cons- The price is way too high. It's the most expensive game ever released in my country. Something close to 90 USD. Considering the amount of content, this game should be F2P. So that's a terrible move by Blizzard. If it wasn't for the price, I'd easily give this game a 9.- Some unbalanced combat situations. Some might argue that I just didn't learn how to effectively counter some specific characters yet. Indeed, I'm still learning so I can't tell for sure, but at first, some classes feel way stronger then others.- 20 Hz tick rate? Choose Tracer and don't stop moving. You're pretty much invincible. Those hit boxes, man.- Being so casual has it's price. The game just released but the lack of more complex game modes and rankings will probably make me grow tired of this pretty soon. There's nothing that forces me to come back and pick up from where I left off. No career progression, nothing.But what it desperately really needs is more content.

The game is very polished, and runs incredibly well even on very low powered hardware.Movement is fluid and fast, and the shooting is satsfying.Heroes are really distinct and have their own personality and gameplay. No hero plays the same like another.  Also, since i have seen this online lately, disregard anyone who complains about hero balance and about cheesy tactics that are somehow ""unbeatable"". This is clearly a ""learn to play"" issue. I played the Beta a lot, and let me tell you, that balance is in a very good place, though could be improved even more. Everything has its counters.While this game has only 12 maps right now, and it is repetitive, it manages to stay fun and interesting for a surprisingly long time. The main reason for this is that the game has immense depth under the casual-friendly appearence, it is one of those easy to learn but very hard to master games. There is always something new to try and learn. And the competitive aspect of the game will keep you coming for more.The main downside of this game, is that if you have no friends to play with, you won't get nearly the same satisfaction with those who do have their own party. This game is heavily based around teamwork and tactics. You can still find success solo, of course, but will be more difficult.Other than that, the game deserves its price. Totally recommended.…"

Overwatch draws heavily from Team Fortress 2, which isn't a bad thing because TF2 is an amazing game. Unfortunately there simply isn't as much depth to this game as there is in TF2 with only 12 maps and 2 game modes (yes, I know there is technically a 3rd mode, but it is just a mashup of the 2 game modes).Despite the varied cast of playable characters, the game gets repetitive quickly.  Especially since a lack of balance means you'll be seeing the same heroes over and over, sometimes 2-3 at once, each and every game.  Yes, hero stacking is a thing.  Additionally, there isn't enough of a payoff for mastering higher skillcap heroes when playing a lower skillcap hero can be more effective (looking at you Bastion).Another issue I had is the lack of a story.  Blizzard put a lot of time and effort into the animated shorts it released in order to set up the story for Overwatch.  Yet, in the game there is not hint at any story, largely because there is no single player campaign, which this game is just begging for.  It's a puzzling decision, and makes it all the more awkward when your team consists of characters heroes and characters that are villains.  Why are they fighting together?  No idea.  To me, this represents a lost opportunity for a game that truly could have been special.Then there is the elephant in the room, the price.  At $60, the content provided feels more like a free to play game than full on AAA release like Call of Duty, where at $60 you get a single player campaign, a lot more multiplayer modes, and a compelling unlock/leveling system.  Oh, and did I mention Overwatch even has microtransactions?  The content and value simply isn't there to justify the price of Overwatch.  I have no doubt the game will sell millions by virtue of the fact it is a Blizzard product, but it's sad that the company that gave us the Warcraft, Starcraft, and Diablo franchises isn't even giving players a fraction of the content that a $60 price tag should include.Disclaimer: Blizzard does offer a $40 version of the game for PC, but they don't widely advertise that fact and actively try to upsell you on the $60 version in a rather misleading fashion.…"

Each character can be very strong in different scenarios, but there are definite counters to each. Torbjörn also comes to mind on defense. He is very strong if you continue to select characters and run into turret fire.I think this game will start to really shine as people hit the level to go into competitive ranked play and will make for a very entertaining E-Sport.Quick Positives:+ Polished Gameplay+ Hard to master+ Promotes teamingQuick Negatives:- Repetitive Maps- Lack of reward/progression…"

For example, characters standing near debris, slanted walls, etc will adjust their feet's physical location so that it makes sense, as in no one appears to just be floating. Equipment, hair, earrings, pretty much anything that would have physics when people move does. The sounds and animations are incredibly varied and smooth on every character, and mechanical parts move in an incredibly realistic way.That being said the game is still in it's infancy stage of release. So the content, while they claim to be expanding soon, is pretty bare right now- even if all of the characters are varied and super fun to play.There are some minor balance issues and matchmaker will probably see some improvements over time.All in all, while resembling TF2 in a few ways (Route 66 map, the game mode types...) it's variety of enjoyable heroes, level of polish, price point with loads of free content promised over this summer, and the Blizzard IP behind it- Overwatch will only gain traction from here on out.…"

I mean even for the casual gamer who only plays mobas, counter strike, or some free p2w mmo giving it a 10 is just too much.Don't get me wrong. Overwatch is not a bad game. On the contrary, it can be quite enjoyable at first with its colorful graphics, tight gameplay and limited but quite balanced character rooster. Even more so if you play it with a couple of friends. But there are only so many things one can do in an online only (60$ no singleplayer...wtf?) game with very few stages and extremely limited game modes. I do believe that eventually you will get tired of the game's repetition but then again I might be underestimating the casual gamer. And what's up with those disgusting rng boxes? Ok so they might not be mandatory because they will only give you cosmetic upgrades but it's still like blizzard is begging for more of your money. First it was day one dlcs and microtransactions then season passes and now we get multiplayer only games like Battlefront, The Division (don't tell me about its singleplayer missions) and now Overwatch. I wouldn't even mind about all that but see, people are buying these games giving the greedy developers motivation to make more of the same since these are the games that sell the most.It's all very sad. Not because these repetitive multiplayer games are overshadowing other worthwhile or even great singleplayer games that have been crafted with much care and love by their developers. Not even because these despicable exercises of greed are becoming a trend in α declining gaming industry. What saddens me the most is that most of these casual gamers will probably never bother giving a chance to all those wonderful games that already exist and will instead keep on with their lives as they have. But then again it might just be me that doesn't  get the point of multiplayer games like overwatch. There is one thing however that I think we call all agree upon. In a full priced game wouldn't it be nice to have the best of both worlds, both multiplayer and singleplayer, so that everyone can be happy? I say yes.…"

On the one hand, the goofy characters and frenetic gameplay lead to some good experiences where you have fun. On the other hand, the game lacks any sort of serious depth and I struggle to play it for hours at a time like I did with Team Fortress 2.Instead of having different loadouts like Team Fortress 2, Overwatch deigns to have many more characters with different abilities which more or less takes the place of the different weapons from TF2. This is fine and it does a great job of making each character unique, but many of the abilities have some serious flaws. Many ultimate abilities for example, can and will essentially destroy an entire enemy team with little counterplay. For example, one hero has an ultimate ability that will aim for you automatically as long as the opposing champions are on your screen. Another hero's ultimate ability automatically fires unavoidable damaging blasts at all hero's in a radius around him. These overpowering abilities detract from an otherwise enjoyable experience.The lack of game modes and maps is also a concern. With only two game modes (Domination with a single point and a Payload-style mode), the game quickly becomes repetitive, exacerbated by the comically small amount of maps for a FPS (12 maps). The game is desperately in need of more content to justify the price tag.By far the largest complaint I have, however, is how short matches are versus the time required to get back into a game. It is common to wait around 30 seconds to get into a match, then you spend another 60 seconds while everyone chooses their character, then you spend another 60 seconds while the defenders set up. At the end of the game, you spend around 30 seconds voting for the best team contributor, and another 30 seconds watching the ""play of the game."" This is in addition to any loading times while the game chooses the map or finds new players to fill a game after others have left. After all of this has occurred - the game has the potential to last just 5 minutes if a team struggles. At it's maximum, most games of Overwatch rarely last longer then 10 minutes. In my humble opinion, the best way to counter this is to introduce longer game-modes such as the popular ""tug of war"" style maps from Team Fortress 2.Despite these flaws, Overwatch definitely has some charm, and it's easy to see the love put into the game - Blizzard are definitely masters at creating appealing games. The characters are likable enough and the maps are mostly satisfactory. It's a game that I tried very hard to love and in the end I found the experience simply ""OK"".If you are looking for a successor to Team Fortress 2, the game fails to deliver a satisfying experience. I would recommend waiting for a sale before investing in this game, and I definitely would not recommend this game for folks who are easily frustrated.…"

Good for them, bad for the videogame market's overall creativity.…"

It takes a few games to start learning the maps and the heroes which in itself is a fun experience.There is a great in game voice chat which ensures that your team do no longer connect on skype, team speak or mumble.Find a few friends and get started!"

It's great they give so many ways to recognize player-skill - you will never feel like your actions go un-noticed. The endless possibilities of hero-on-hero combat is addictive and ever-evolving.

The Hero's feel balanced - though It's been a long process of tweaking stats, and the game will continue to be closely monitored in this regard. I can't wait to see what new hero's and maps are introduced in the future (I literally can't wait, I've been spoiled by beta's and I'm ready for more). The game is polished to a squeaky-clean shine and very immersive. It's just a fantastic game that will suck hours of your life away. Overwatch is definitely here to stay - yet another success for Blizzard. Keep it up, and thanks for giving our beloved industry some standards!…"

The best part of this game is that no game is ever over because of big ultimates.  This is the first Blizzard game that I've played and it really lives up the name that Blizzard have made for themselves."

You think Activision/Blizzard wouldn't want to boast these scores in marketing?Now about the actual game, we all criticized Titanfall, Evolve, Battlefront for all being mutilplayer only but Overwatch gets a free pass? Battlefront actually had more content at launch 14 maps to overwatchs 12(they are also much smaller). It's simple, it's Blizzard, and they'll get away with it.Yes! The game is fun but it's not 10/10 fun, it is going to get stale after several long hour playthroughs you are going to see the same things over and over again. This isn't a moba, nor does this game have custom maps or modes better yet pc won't get mods so that the Lootboxes are pay2play contents.…"
10,"Overwatch is a very addictive, fast game-play FPS. I played 100 hours in the beta alone and already have 10 after release. I have not had this much fun since the early days of TF2. The 40$ price tag is very cheap for how much content you get and their in game purchases are not in any way pay to win."
10,"From the locations & character design, voiceovers to creative and unpredictable gameplay this has to be the best FPS released in recent years. It brings a fresh breeze to the genre that grew a little stale over time. All with the high polish that is Blizzard's quality trademark."
