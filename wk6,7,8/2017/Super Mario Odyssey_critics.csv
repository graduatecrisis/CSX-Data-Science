"CD-Action","100","The best entry to the best platforming series is so ridiculously huge it’s like a theme park made of theme parks. It’s a wonderful tribute to Super Mario 64, but it’s not a lazy homage. Super Mario Odyssey draws inspiration from the superb classic to top it and everything that came after it. [13/2017, p.38]"
"LEVEL (Czech Republic)","100","Probably the best Mario game and one of the best games of this year. Pure, uncompromised entertainment with lots of fresh ideas and worlds that are a pleasure to discover. [Issue#280]"
"Games.cz","100","An incredibly playful platform game full of amazing ideas, which almost don´t repeat. If you are a fan of platformers, you should try Mario – you will not find such original gameplay and the transformations of one genre anywhere else."
"IGN Japan","100","Mario easily jumps high above all expectations. Even if you think that Super Mario Odyssey is not for you, you'll be shouting out ""YAHOO!"" like a kid once Cappy is done with you."
"FANDOM","100","Mario’s first Switch outing is not only one of the best releases in an unusually brilliant year, but arguably one of Nintendo’s greatest gaming achievements ever. With refreshingly varied kingdom designs that offer a playful mix of the old and the new, Super Mario Odyssey is a game where you never really know what to expect next.  We could tell you more about the individual moments that make this game such a magical experience, but honestly, to reveal too many of its secrets would simply spoil the fun."
"GameGrin","100","Super Mario Odyssey is a phenomenal return for Nintendo’s mustachioed mascot, and (whisper it) the worthy successor to Super Mario 64 that fans have been longing for."
"The Digital Fix","100","Updated for a new generation, yet full of old school charm and nostalgia for long time Mario fans. Super Mario Odyssey is simply one of the most joyous games of all time."
"We Got This Covered","100","Super Mario Odyssey is a pure expression of joy and fun that never ceases to amaze or delight."
"Gameplanet","100","Super Mario Odyssey is an innovative masterpiece that takes an already creative series to the next level, demonstrating that there is no limit to the adventures that can be had in games or the ways they can be played."
"GamingTrend","100","Super Mario Odyssey is a treat that needs to be experienced by everyone who has a Switch. The attention to detail mixed with a host of expansive content and enjoyable gameplay will have you coming back for more."
"games(TM)","100","We don't give out tens lightly, but we have to ask, what more could we have wanted from this game? What could it have offered that would have made it better? The answer is not much. Playing Super Mario Odyssey is to experience pure joy. We couldn't wish for anything more than that from this series or from Nintendo. [Issue#193, p.64]"
"Digital Chumps","100","Super Mario Odyssey is essential gaming.  It’s a sanguine throwback, a jewel of gaming fundamentals distilled to its core, constructed with the building materials of fun and surprise.  Predictability and reason have no place on this journey—but the kid in all of us will surely take the helm, a smile on his face."
"DualShockers","100","Super Mario Odyssey is a bold re-introduction to 3D Mario and one that is flat-out mandatory in 2017. The game is not the challenging, rigorous exercise found in the series’ past so much as a deep dive into abject fun originality. Placing creativity and wonder above all else, Super Mario Odyssey is Nintendo’s equivalent of a Pixar movie: magical, creative, and captivating, no matter what age you are."
"Easy Allies","100","Super Mario Odyssey embraces its heritage at every turn, and the payoff isn’t merely a warm feeling of nostalgia at the fan service, but a reworking of the old with the new to produce something completely unique. Previous games have brief moments of wonder and charm, but they do not come close to the emotional gratification of Odyssey. Near-flawless controls, amazing worlds, a phenomenal new special ability, and a sense of freedom that’s not been seen in any previous game all add up to something special. This is another Mario game that will be remembered for ages to come."
"GameSpew","100","Super Mario Odyssey’s unabashed sense of whimsy and charm is all too welcome in today’s modern video game climate. Whereas other titles feel the need to overbear you with endless things to do, people to kill and towers to climb, Mario’s latest globe-trotting adventure is all too happy to keep things simple — and in the most imaginative way possible. Super Mario Odyssey is the type of game that I’d probably have taken for granted as a kid, but as an adult, I’ll cherish it for decades."
"Twinfinite","100","It’s adorable, heartwarming, comforting, and just an absolute joy to play. Super Mario Odyssey sees the series return to the collect-a-thon/3D platformer genre that it, itself pioneered, and once again, Mario is setting the flag up high for others to follow."
"The Sydney Morning Herald","100","Mario Odyssey is an inventive, playful and incredibly polished experience that pays constant homage to the storied series' past while never feeling redundant or old. From the creative way classic characters and styles of play are inserted into the worlds to the brand new capture mechanic that gives a new perspective on what an open-world Mario game can be, this is a timeless journey I'll keep coming back to for a long time."
"DarkZero","100","Not only does Super Mario Odyssey celebrate the history of Mario over his 30 years with nostalgic treats, but it embodies the delight of discovery that comes with the openness of a sandbox Mario title, pushing it forward with Nintendo’s creativity to think up thrilling platforming scenarios. Nintendo has delivered a superb game that wants to take players on a trip through its bizarre and wonderful landscapes without restrictions, something that has been absent for too long in modern platform games."
"Gaming Age","100","This latest entry to Mario certainly helps prove that single player experiences still have a place in an industry where games as a service seems to be the norm. I managed complete the game in about 20-30 hours, a robust post-game will keep the me coming back for more. Coupled with Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild, it looks like Nintendo will need to clear some shelf space when end of the year awards are named by the gaming press. If you don’t have a Switch, I’d encourage you to get one immediately before the holiday rush begins. This is an experience you should not sit on."
"GameSpace","100","Simply put, Super Mario Odyssey is the best game of 2017, and one of the greatest games of all time. Nintendo is on a roll. Long live the King."
"Vgames","100","In my eyes, Nintendo has created the Magnum Opus of 3D Sandbox Open-World Platforming with this game. From start to finish, this game oozes with fun, great gameplay, amazing worlds and vistas and absolutely phenomenal music. The fact you have to use motion controls in order to get the full use of Cappy is weird but that's the only bad thing I can say about this game. Nintendo is spoiling us this year."
"Hardcore Gamer","100","Mario has over thirty years of history behind him and yet Odyssey manages to mix those feelings of old titles with new ideas for a fresh take on a genre everyone is familiar with. Whether in it for a simple fun time or looking to play Odyssey to completion, there’s tons to be enjoyed by every player that will keep pulling them back for more. Mario’s trip across the world is one of pure, simple joy that simply shouldn’t be missed. Super Mario Odyssey is nothing short of a love story to the series as a whole and a title no Switch owner should be without."
"Atomix","100","Super Mario Odyssey is the culmination of years of experience from Nitendo's developers. It seems like everything great from past games has found its place in this adventure. All the exploration and its marvels are back, combined with great platforming and surprises. Also, Super Mario Odyssey is a game that really pushes the Switch's capabilities... and you can play on the go and get some Power Moons anywhere, anytime."
"3DJuegos","100","Mario jumps 30 years in time, and it's one of the biggest jumps ever made, not only in the Super Mario franchise, but in the history of Nintendo. Odyssey is evolution, talent and a non-stop enjoyment. A game that marks a new hit in the platforms game genre and that justifies going to the shop to buy a Nintendo Switch."
"Pocket Gamer UK","100","Wild, Weird, and packed full of imagination, Super Mario Odyssey is the first platform exclusive that every Switch owner needs to own."
"IBTimes UK","100","Nintendo proves once again why it is the very best at what it does, with the Super Mario game players have waited 15 years for. Rooted in an wonderfully absurd design idea, Odyssey is a glorious and jubilant adventure for all that, like its plump hero, revels in the freedom to explore, experiment and play."
"TrueGaming","100","Super Mario Odyssey is one of the best experiences this year with its great gameplay and huge amount of content with a lot of different ideas. Definitely will be one of the games nominated for game of the year"
"Areajugones","100","Super Mario Odyssey is without a doubt one of the best games of recent years and probably of the franchise. Great gameplay mechanics, an outstanding number of worlds and amazing graphics are the ingredients of this masterpiece."
"Giant Bomb","100","Each kingdom is absolutely packed with charm, clever objectives, gorgeous visuals, a stellar soundtrack, and a huge variety of ways to have fun. One moon would have me leaping across tiny platforms with pinpoint precision, and the next would have me cheering up a businessman by dressing like a clown. At no point did I feel like I was checking boxes just to up my completion percentage. Even now that I've collected every moon and purple coin in the game, I still want to play more of it. It’s one of the most joyous and entertaining gaming experiences I’ve had in a long time, and it stands tall among the all-time great Mario games."
"VideoGamer","100","It's extraordinary, really, that after all this time a new Mario game can feel as fresh as any that preceded it. Cappy is a revelation, exploring Kingdoms is bliss, and Super Mario Odyssey is a masterpiece."
"Game Revolution","100","While I may be far removed from the days spent playing Super Mario World as a kid, completing it for the umpteenth time and still finding new secrets with each playthrough, experiencing Super Mario Odyssey transported me back to that same sense of wonder I felt when I first discovered the Star World, or when I used my cape to accidentally stumble upon a secret key that opened up a brand new level. Nintendo has delivered everything I could want in a Mario game, before adding things that I didn't even know I wanted. The end result of their efforts is a true modern masterpiece."
"USgamer","100","Super Mario Odyssey honors much of what makes other 3D Mario games great, plus it adds plenty of its own flavor to the Mario stew thanks to its capture mechanic. Mario Odyssey can keep you busy for hours and hours if you want it to, and you probably will. Outside of a few instances where the camera took on a mind of its own, I can't think of a moment when I wasn't enjoying myself while journeying with Mario and Cappy."
"GamesRadar+","100","Super Mario Odyssey successfully brings the series up to date and opens it up to a new audience, while still retaining every ounce of its nostalgia and retro charm."
"Game Rant","100","In almost every way, the game acts as a love letter to fans of the 3D iterations of the Super Mario franchise. From the spectacular Kingdoms and all of their hidden secrets to the minute nods to past ventures and friends, the entirety of this adventure is a joyride from beginning to end – with countless hours that can be invested into the title long after the narrative has been completed. The formulaic changes have helped modernized a genre that has long been dormant, which is an immense feat in and of itself."
"Guardian","100","New sidekick Cappy could have been just another annoying sidekick, but its inclusion only adds to the playfulness of Nintendo Switch’s first Mario adventure."
"IGN","100","Mario’s games have been around for almost as long as game consoles have been a thing, but thankfully, he’s always evolving. We rarely get the same Mario twice. Super Mario Odyssey delivers on that ongoing promise of originality and innovation: It distills the venerable series’ joyful, irreverent world and characters and best-in-class platforming action, and introduces a steady stream of new and unexpected mechanics. It’s all spun together into a generational masterpiece."
"FNintendo","100","Super Mario Odyssey takes everything that made its predecessors masterpieces of gaming and blends them together into an unforgettable, new and unique experience that packs an absurd amount of content and which will keep players clinging on to it for many, many wonderful hours to come. An absolute monument of a game that gets everything right and which comes down to not only one of the greatest games of this generation but one of the greatest games of all time."
"Cubed3","100","The wait is over; the pinnacle of 3D adventures has arrived in the form of Super Mario Odyssey. It beggars belief just how much Nintendo has packed into this latest outing, without compromising the core Mario goodness of the past. Just as with The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, the Mario series has now reached a special new level of greatness that will be hard to surpass in the future. The Nintendo Switch is fast becoming the hottest platform, crammed full of sublime quality gaming experiences like this fantastic new escapade."
"Gameblog.fr","100","By jumping aboard the Odyssey, Mario takes us on a trip where await nothing but discoveries and wonders all along. By gathering elements from every game of the franchise, Nintendo expand the classic gameplay with Cappy's possession. Diverse, intelligent, colorful and incredibly long and surprising, the free exploration will satisfy both curious and hardcore gamers. Super Mario Odyssey sanctifies a 30-year-old series that still amazes us episode after episode."
"NintendoWorldReport","100","As someone who enjoys level-based Super Mario games more, I have to say that Odyssey blew me away. With the next Power Moon constantly within reach, the push forward is constant. Using Mario's expanded moveset, unique challenges are abound while trying to collect your next Power Moon. Even the lack of traditional power-ups doesn’t hurt the experience at all, as the team of Mario and Cappy offers all sorts of wonderful new abilities. The journey of this odyssey took me to all sorts of amazing worlds that I already find myself missing. Now that I've seen every bit of it, I look back on my adventure with a great smile. It is an incredible experience that I felt extremely compelled to complete, simply because I didn't want it all to end. Only the best games pull that feeling out of me, and this one did just that. Super Mario Odyssey is my favorite game on Switch by a long shot."
"Trusted Reviews","100","It carried ginormous expectations, but somehow Nintendo has managed to leapfrog over the bar by a huge distance. Offering the most satisfying gameplay experience of any Mario game to date, Super Mario Odyssey is near-perfect."
"Nintendo Enthusiast","100","Super Mario Odyssey is the best game available on Nintendo Switch, and just might be my favorite game of the year. It isn’t just a masterclass of level and sound design, it’s a celebration of the Super Mario franchise, and one of helluva celebration to take part in."
"Nintendo Life","100","Super Mario Odyssey represents a shift in direction for Mario. For about a decade we had exceptional but tightly structured 3D series entries, but this new arrival's building blocks go back to Super Mario 64. It's a very modern take on 'sandbox Mario', however - Cappy and his abilities are key additions that freshen up the formula, and we have a sizeable and diverse set of lands to explore. Odyssey will, inevitably, now enter the discussions about the 'best' Mario games. This writer won't be crowning it as number one just yet, but it is nevertheless worthy of the discussion. Particularly in the second half and post-credits it takes on a life of its own, showcasing incredible design and development flair. It's also a wonderful showcase for the Switch, and could introduce a whole new audience to the wonders of Mario in three dimensions. For the veterans among us, it's yet another special release to remind us of why Mario is still gaming's number one."
"Switch Player","100","Not since Super Mario 64 has a Mario adventure had me this captivated, immersed or impressed. Super Mario Odyssey is Nintendo's finest Super Mario title yet, and easily the most impressive Nintendo Switch title available. With so much to see and do - long after you've dispatched Bowser - you'll be returning to the Odyssey for a long time. Essential for all Switch owners and worth buying a Switch for. It's that good. [Issue 9, Page 16]"
"Telegraph","100","The pleasure of Super Mario Odyssey comes in the constant promise of something new. It is, in many ways, the greatest digital holiday you will ever take. An idea that Nintendo is very much aware of with the ever expanding wardrobe of travelling outfits, detailed maps for each Kingdom laid out like travel brochures and souvenirs that you can buy up with stage-specific coins. The variety, invention and sheer generosity on each trip is bewildering, an affirmation that Nintendo in this kind of exuberant form are absolutely peerless. A trip to savour. And not a second wasted."
"TheSixthAxis","100","Super Mario Odyssey is bursting at the seams with creativity, as Nintendo plays with new ideas while also paying homage to their long history. Cappy's abilities are a perfect compliment to Mario's own, and there's a wonderful silliness and humour to their adventure as they visit a string of contrasting kingdoms that just beg you to find the secrets hidden around every corner. Simply put, Super Mario Odyssey is a masterpiece."
"Vooks","100","Nintendo has managed, not once, but twice now in 2017 to take one of their beloved franchises, give it a breath of fresh air while still retaining the core of what made the series great in the first time. Super Mario Odyssey is a wonder and shows everyone why Mario is still king."

"COGconnected","100","Super Mario Odyssey is a masterpiece. It surprised me regularly, delighted me constantly, and smashed my expectations in ways I’d never have predicted. The deftly woven combination of nostalgic themes, intuitive gameplay, and incredibly inventive design make this not only the best Mario game to date, but one of the most joyful and compelling games ever made."
"Critical Hit","100","It’s impossible to pinpoint a fault in Super Mario Odyssey, which both elegantly and eloquently surprises and calls back to its storied history. It’s a game full of surprises; one that plays with your expectations and supersedes them in almost every way. If you have a Switch (or are yet to get one), it’s simply essential."
"Digitally Downloaded","100","I’d usually count myself a completionist who’s only goal is to earn every single achievement possible, but Super Mario Odyssey showed me that there’s so much more to it than collecting things. Maybe I’ll revisit the wonder of the Cascade Kingdom and ride a Tyrannosaurus Rex. I could even play fetch with a shiba inu amongst the sand dunes, or bust out Mario’s infamous swimsuit and test my skills against an ornery octopus thirsty for revenge. The best part of getting to the game’s ending is the fact that it’s a journey of your own creation, and if you reflect on the game as a whole, it’s really a linear quest that somehow feels more freeing than the largest open-world game."
"EGM","100","A mix of the nostalgic, the fantastical, and the wonderfully bizarre, Mario's latest adventure provides more than a dozen tantalizing playgrounds to explore. With hundreds of collectibles, Kingdoms full of delightful details, and secrets waiting around every corner, Super Mario Odyssey is bound to keep players exploring long after the credits roll."
"GamesBeat","100","This is another Mario all-time classic that we'll be remembering and celebrating for decades to come."

"God is a Geek","100","Platforming perfection, full stop."
"Edge Magazine","100","Like Breath of the Wild, Odyssey is a new entry in a long-running series that belies its age with sprightly invention, taking big risks with an established formula, and having all of them pay off handsomely. Mario might be getting on a bit, then, but a dinosaur? This astonishing adventure proves he's anything but. [Dec 2017, p.98]"

"Game Informer","98","Quibbles aside, Super Mario Odyssey is an absolute delight, and another Switch release that will have Nintendo fans debating which 3D Mario game is the best of them all. I still hang my hat on Super Mario Galaxy as the pinnacle of the series, but Odyssey and its wealth of gameplay styles and moons make it a close second."
"AusGamers","98","Super Mario Odyssey isn’t just the best platformer to come around in years, it’s also one of the most essential releases of the year. Period. A showcase for Nintendo’s development talent and Mario as an iconic character that can still deliver surprising and transformative experiences even after all these years. It’s a game that not for a second lags or starts to feel like more of the same. It rewards players in ways that we rarely get to see, and even when it’s over it begins anew and invites you to keep exploring, keep discovering, and keep reaching for the moon."
"The Games Machine","97","Super Mario Odyssey is a true expression of joy: a vibrant explosion of colours, surprises, wonderful design and excellent gameplay.

"Everyeye.it","97","Super Mario Odyssey is the rightful heir of Super Mario 64. It is a platform game full of surprises, secrets and wonderful levels. Original and astonishing, Super Mario Odyssey is a journey which will impress you the way only masterpieces can do."
"IGN Spain","97","One of those games that you have to play without doubt. Fun, deep, full of secrets and beautiful. Nintendo has done it again, and now we all love Mario in every possible form."
"Game Over Online","96","Super Mario Odyssey has a few flaws, but the end result is Mario’s grandest and best 3D adventure to date. There is so much to do and enjoy that this game should give players years of fun, even if they aren’t out to complete every single quest and grab every moon."
"Cheat Code Central","96","Super Mario Odyssey feels like a new glove that fits like an old glove, the new high point of a decades-long evolutionary process that is so smooth, so finely-tuned, that playing it nearly feels like an extension of yourself. It creeps up on you, the scale and design of it all, in a way that often doesn’t dawn on you just how purely grand it is until you stop playing and reflect on your experience. In a year full to bursting of huge, great games, Super Mario Odyssey stands out by acknowledging what’s cool and works about games today. It trims all the fat and doubles-down on not a gameplay loop, but a gameplay flow that feels effortless the whole way through. Even when you lose, when a challenging bit sends you sailing into the Nintendo-y abyss, you just keep going. Super Mario Odyssey is here to remind us how uniquely compelling jumping and flipping around a colorful video game space is and lets us indulge as long as we can stand it."
"Vandal","96","Mario is back with one of his best adventures yet – a fantastic game that reminds us why Nintendo is still relevant after 30 years. Pure fun, perfect control and one of the most generous and surprising endgames we’ve ever seen in a game like this."
"NF Magazine","95","Perhaps no past Mario game has ever elicited so many smiles as this, and even if every other winning aspect of its design were set aside, that reality alone would make it a masterpiece. [Issue #31 – January/February 2018, p. 39E]"
"Forbes","95","It's a world that feels huge at first, then small as you get to know it, and then huge again as you realize how fantastically dense it is with secrets and challenges. It gives you a simple set of tools and then asks you to do something different with them every ten minutes. Super Mario Odyssey is a fun game, an unoriginal observation that feels nonetheless vital in the modern gaming landscape. It is a game that tasks you with finding joy, and then lets you point yourself in the right direction. It is a game you should play."
"App Trigger","95","With the exception of some very occasional control frustrations, Super Mario Odyssey is a visual, auditory, and structural treat to play from start to finish for anyone at any skill level, and seems to delight in the player’s enjoyment.

"GameOver.gr","95","An immersive gaming experience that will have you travelling through a plethora of kingdoms, with many secrets to discover and many opportunities to experience the unique features of the console. A game that is sure to make Miyamoto-san proud of the newer teams working on the Super Mario Universe."
"Gamer.nl","95","Super Mario Odyssey is an amazing experience for Mario fans, but even gamers that are not familiar with Nintendo's mascot will definitely enjoy this game.

"SpazioGames","95","Mario Odyssey is an incredible game: is the infinite possibilities that a simple cap and some fantasy can bring to the evergreen Nintendo World."
"Polygon","95","For a character nearing 40 years old, it’s amazing that Mario has remained not only a beloved character but one whose games are generally expected to be great. From that perspective, it’s no surprise that Super Mario Odyssey is, yes, a great game. But more than that, it’s a fantastic, even fundamental addition to Mario’s legacy.

"Metro Montreal","90","Nintendo has proved countless times that it can balance innovation and nostalgia like no one else, and Super Mario Odyssey is a great example. The hat completely transforms the gameplay, but at its core, it’s still really much a Mario game. It’s a game with many strengths and very few weaknesses."
"ZTGD","90","There are endless joys to discuss with Super Mario Odyssey. Being a huge fan of Mario 64, this game is a love letter for me. I enjoyed every minute I was playing it and cannot wait until I get some free time to return and continue collecting moons. Switch owners need this game, players without a Switch need to go buy one to play it. Nintendo knocks another one out of the park, and this may very well be their best year of games since the Super Nintendo."
"DarkStation","90","Super Mario Odyssey is a lovely experience from beginning to end. The sheer scope of the game can be a little overwhelming and there are some bumps you’ll encounter in your journey. If you’re searching for a solid experience on the Nintendo Switch beside The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, you should definitely take this odyssey with Mario."
"Toronto Sun","90","Cappy’s powers make for some fresh puzzle solving and a new line up of supporting bad guys have been added. Toss in a storyline that is totally bonkers, really all that matters is that Bowser has once again kidnapped Princess Peach, and you end up with an Odyssey for the ages."

"GameCrate","90","Super Mario Odyssey is exactly what we all expected, a great 3D Mario game. It doesn’t shake up the formula, but it nearly perfects it. This is the collect-a-thon platformer that people have been waiting for, a chance to bring the genre into the modern day gaming environment. All it took was a massive expansion of scope."
"Washington Post","90","I can’t think of another 2017 title that has given me as much pure delight as Mario Odyssey."
"Yahoo!","90","Mario’s big debut on the Switch is a joy to experience. Its beautifully realized worlds, excellent platforming, admiration for series’ past and new gameplay mechanics make Super Mario Odyssey worthy of the portly plumber’s legacy."
"The Daily Dot","90","With hundreds of Power Moons to collect, an entire wardrobe of outfits that span Mario’s storied history, and no shortage of Easter eggs to uncover, Super Mario Odyssey is one of the most complete packages Nintendo has ever offered."
"Post Arcade (National Post)","90","Super Mario Odyssey is an absolute delight that will remind you why you started playing games in the first place."
"4Players.de","90","An inspired and creative jump & run adventure with funny transformations and remarkably clever hidden secrets. Overall the story mode is a little bit too easy for experienced Mario players, but nonetheless this is a tremendous new start for Nintendo's iconic hero - even though overall I still prefer the spheres of Super Mario Galaxy and its cool planet mechanics."
"Eurogamer Italy","90","In the first appearance of Super Mario on Switch, Nintendo revives all its 3D games of the past in one unmissable title."
"Worth Playing","87","I love Super Mario Odyssey, but it isn't flawless. The kingdoms are mostly open and varied, and they encourage fun exploration. However, the main story and beginning of the game are a bit of a letdown. The postgame is where experienced players will find the most enjoyment. This is not the best Mario title, but it pushes Mario in a new and refreshing direction, and it may even develop into a Switch evergreen. There are plenty of things that I'd like to see rectified in the inevitable sequel."
"JeuxActu","85","We were expecting a tremendous Mario, but in the end, Super Mario Odyssey is not as glorious as it appears. If it has undeniable qualities with well-oiled gameplay mechanics, it also displays technical issues and inequalities in the worlds we visited. Plus, the costumes that we earn are only cosmetic bonuses and the adventure ends a little quickly. But don't panic, Super Mario Odyssey is still a good episode and we've had fun with it."
"GameCritics","80","Aside from those issues and a cooperative mode that seems to exist purely to give a spectator something to do, I had a great time with Odyssey. It doesn’t feel like the massive leap forward that some of Mario’s earlier 3D outings have been, but its polish and spirit make it another must-play in the ever-increasingly impressive Switch library. Leave it to Nintendo to deliver us some blissful escapism in a year when a lot of us really need it."
"Digital Trends","80","Mario’s first turn on the Switch is fun, but lacks the innovation and creativity of Nintendo’s best."
"Glixel","80","For now, as a Mario game that continues the Switch's moves to blur the line between the portable and the home-based console, Super Mario Odyssey is a beautiful, rewarding example of what Nintendo has in store for the system."
"M3","80","Super Mario Odyssey introduces several new gameplay mechanics to a beloved series, and delivers a colorful adventure that oozes with fun and nostalgia. It looks, sounds and plays just as great as expected, but the collection of power moons can sometimes feel a bit like a chore."
"PLAY! Zine","75","Though a really neat game, Super Mario Odyssey is an utterly underwhelming adventure for every long-term Super Mario fan in existence. Unless Cappy brainwashed you. In that case, you are a satisfied zombie customer now. No, seriously, only a zombie would find a healthy challenge in this pleasant but disappointingly easy Super Mario Walk-in-the-park. Sorry - Odyssey."
