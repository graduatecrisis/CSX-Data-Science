10,"In the starting area "" great plateau"" there is endless amounts of things to do and it feels huge! I climbed a mountain to find a shrine and it felt like such a journey. I felt accomplishment something you rarely feel on video games these days.This has to be without a doubt game of the year, and as my experience with the game continues i feel like it could possibly be the best game ever made."
10,"Stunning in every way, While everyone thought that this Zelda would just copy new games and lose its identity, it showed everyone else how its done. What an amazing time to be a gamer"
10,"Breath of the Wild broke a lot of records in the history of gaming. By that, I mean it is most likely impossible to find one thing wrong with this game. It's like Nintendo took the base of Ocarina of Time and modernize it to make it look like this game over here. This is why Nintendo will forever remain in my heart no matter where it all goes.

I'm telling you this, Breath of the Wild has everything... yes, every... single... thing that made Ocarina of Time look like a masterpiece. This is the lost brother of Ocarina of Time and the true brother Ocarina of Time will ever need. Just go buy this game, it wants your money so bad, it wants you to play it so bad, it wants to be your local friend literally bad. I'll be waiting until you get this game.…"
10,"This game is amazing. It's beautiful and It's so fun I just could not put it down. I love going around and exploring and doing the side quests. The gameplay changed things up from previous Zelda games and its great. The music is fantastic. It's just a great game. I love it."
10,"Breath of the Wild is potent mix of pure Nintendo magic with a strong dose of modern, open-world sensibilities. The combination is something truly wonderful that deserves your time and hard-earned money. Do yourselves a favour and jump right in - the water is just right."
10,"Este juego es la perfeccion en cuanto a juegos de mundo abierto y una revolucion en cuanto a la saga de The Legend Of Zelda se refiere. Excelente en todos los aspectos."
10,"Believe the hype. I was skeptical at first, seeing so many 10s and 100s given out to this game. I went blindly into Breath of the Wild knowing nothing about it except for the main trailer of the game.

10,"This is Nintendo! They've done it again! Captivating adventure, unforgettable experience. Lost for words to fully express the way this game makes a player feel. It is unique and you need to find out for yourself what makes it so. An instant classic, no two ways about it."
10,"Down with the fake reviews! I totally own this game and it is awesome!Playing it on the Nintendo Switch is great!  I hope Nintendo can launch other great games during Switch Life Time."

But i was pleased he did as it showed us just how many people can enjoy the SWITCH.It's a pure gaming experience and fun too!An hour later and my Zelda collectors edition, the collectors guide and my case and screen protector set had arrived.. and i'm simply blown away. The game is beautiful, subtle and deep, it's one hell of an adventure and it has only just begun.. i wont say any more because it is something that has to be played  and on a console system that you have to experience.I have experienced no Joy Con issue's, no low frame rates, no stuttering or overheating.I have just taken my first step off of the great plateau and as my adventure lays ahead of me i cant help but think that this time round its also Nintendo's turn to take the leap of faith from off  of a great plateu and into the Breath Of The Wild,.Bravo Nintendo, Bravo…"
10,"Nintendo has done it again, the king of games is back!! The game is beautiful looking with its art style and plus its game play and story, you are going to have a awesome experience. I can't wait to see what they will do with the next Zelda title and where they take the games direction this time."
10,"Its amazing how these fanboys come just to zero vote a game they dont even play, the BoTW user score will remain as a reminder of how much damage Sony has caused with his market strategies"
10,"Great game!Amazing sound track. Fun gameplay and Mechanics. Nice graphics and art style. So far the story has been good.If you like Zelda and/or open world games you need to get BOTW."
10,"The game is great.  As for those saying it is boring or too easy I don't agree.  The direction of the game was to explore and solve puzzles.  It keeps the Zelda charm while building on the past models.I still think link to the past is the best Zelda game in the series but for a 3d Zelda this is a must play."
10,"The BEST OpenWorld RPG ever created. This is even better than the Witcher 3 in which I've already spent 100+ hours. This game is a must have game of this generation.I'm playing it on my Wii U and truly speaking, I want to try it on Switch in handheld mode.truly a gem though.I'd call it 11/10 because bs games like MGSV and GTA 5 got 10/10 from many media outlets."

10,"A good game, with a pretty art direction, and incrible things to do and physics systems, for me is the best game i already played ! We have a  magical adventure with Link, the definitve hero of the games, thank you nintendo for all!"
10,"The Legend of Zelda’s prolific, seminal history has been striking the hearts of players across the globe for three decades. Attachment fans have with the series has withstood the test of time thanks to its immense and vibrant world of Hyrule, memorable characters, iconic set pieces, composition, and more. Now the newest Zelda game is finally here and puts players back in Hyrule where theyThe Legend of Zelda’s prolific, seminal history has been striking the hearts of players across the globe for three decades. Attachment fans have with the series has withstood the test of time thanks to its immense and vibrant world of Hyrule, memorable characters, iconic set pieces, composition, and more. Now the newest Zelda game is finally here and puts players back in Hyrule where they must protect the kingdom from the ferocious evil that is Calamity Ganon after being asleep for 100 years. Breath of the Wild breaks out of a lot of classic Zelda traits, while instilling new ones and simultaneously making the world and game familiar for veterans, as well as accessible and eye-opening to new players alike. Breath of the Wild is unlike anything we’ve ever seen before, not just for Zelda standards, but for gaming as a whole.From the moment you get out of your slumber, you’re invited into the stunning portrait of Hyrule, painted in an exotic green, with the perfect blue hue of the sky and red rays of the sun. It doesn’t take long before you’re on your own and adventuring out into the wilderness, trying to recollect who you are and find your way back as a noble swordsman like you once were.Breath of the Wild’s map size is huge. Really huge. The gigantic portion of the Great Plateau in which you begin is only a spec on the massive open world you’re put into. However, despite the size, it is surprisingly easy to find your way around thanks to landmarks and other cues that guide the player through the story and where they need to go next, but that doesn’t stop you from going off, exploring, and climbing wherever you please – or even going straight to Ganon if you so choose. It’s quite remarkable how Nintendo was able to build a game so big yet so coherent without ever losing a sense of value or direction. Everything you do feels like it has a purpose, and even if it may not seem like it right away, there will always be something down the line that rewards you for your efforts in whatever it is you do and how you choose to explore. Side quests among other tasks all have a reason and aren’t there to artificially increase the longevity of the game. Every task, every quest, every action impacts you and Hyrule as you see it.Hyrule is your playground. Now that you have the ability to go anywhere and do virtually anything, you’ll have to be well equipped – not only with a hefty amount of stamina to climb and run, but with equipment as well. Your weapons will deteriorate and inevitably break over time, which is why you should always be on the lookout for new ones, especially those that enemies drop. Sometimes you’ll feel like you’ve conquered a certain area because you see it as “the easy part of Hyrule”, only to get hit by a flame arrow seconds later that take nearly eight hearts off of you in one hit. Always be on your guard, and if you see your weapon is about to break, you can always throw them directly at an enemy for a critical hit for one last hoorah before having to switch (snap) over to another to defend yourself further. The same will apply to your shield and arrows, and each have their own attributes and strength, so carry whatever you feel is necessary. Even if something is of an extremely low value, when you don’t have much with you, it’s always good to take it with you just in case. I can’t tell you how many close calls I’ve had only to be saved by my measly low level laughable weapons thanks to throwing and headshots. A battle of wits will always conquer a battle of strength.Breath of the Wild introduces a new cooking system, and it’s an exciting mechanic to say the least. Those familiar with creating recipes by combining various materials gained from monster parts the items scavenged throughout the world in Monster Hunter will have a lot to look forward to. You can take just about any five items in your inventory and throw them into a cooking pot, and chances are it will make something worth having. I’ve noticed, however, that combining elements that make the most sense will give you the most reward. It’s no different from cooking in real life. Vegetables go very well with other vegetables, but sometimes meat will complement the dish as well. Maybe you’d like a nice steak with a side of carrots? Go for it. You’ll gain ten hearts for that alone. Or maybe you’d want to go the seafood route and cook some salmon with suateed mushrooms? Go for it. That’ll restore fifteen hearts and give you a temporary stamina boost as well as an increase in cold resistance. It’s all left up to the player how they want to cook, and with enough food to make the world go round, the possibilities are endless. Every dish will provide you with something useful, even the extremely gross ones.This game is just simply stunning and amazing! Game of the Century. Called it here (first).…"
10,"""Revolutionary"" isn't enough of a word to describe how amazing this game is.If you're reading this, never mind the haters who gave this negative reviews on purpose to lower the overall score - most haven't even played the game at all.Play it. It's an absolute must have."

10,"Libertad es la palabara para describirlo, puedes hacer misiones y mazmorras o ir a por el jefe final directamente. El juego te da la oportunidad de hacer lo que quieras y es algo jamas visto, marca un antes y un despues. Jugablemente es preciso y precioso. Gracias Nintendo por estos juegos."
10,"The fact that there are so many people hating, giving zero instead of an appropriate score, only shows how the excellence of this game is disturbing. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is the best game in gaming history so far, already surpassing Ocarina of Time as the highest critically rated game."
10,"este juego es el mejor zelda que e jugado jamas pense que un zelda superaria a twilight princess que para mi era el mejor zelda jugar este juego es como si estuvieses dentro de el es una maravilla todos sus apartados."

10,"This game is probably one of the games that will never die; it seems timeless. Nintendo for sure know how to get their fans excited, and it is never disappointing."
10,"I'm absolutely blown away. Games like this come once every decade. Everything we had hoped for and more. I was very concerned at first, as Nintendo kept delaying the game. But damn was the delay worth the finished product. An incredible and immersive open world. Funny, lovable characters. Excellent combat.

Excellent combat. I'm about 6 hours in and the game is starting to  get quite difficult. You'll notice this once you can leave the Plateau and are given free reign to travel wherever you want. I got absolutely wiped out by the Guardians patrolling the field in front of the castle. I'm gonna explore the world more and more, before committing myself to the main quest. I really love how this game gives you freedom that is lacking in most open world titles. I don't think that I've been this struck in awe since the days of Ocarina of Time on N64. Bravo Nintendo! Way to prove that you guys are still the best in the business. I give this is absolute 10/10. A perfect game for the greatest video game franchise of all time.…"

10,"This is a game that takes the best aspects of gaming goliaths such as The Elder Scrolls, Dark Souls, Portal, and Assassins creed, then mixes them up in a cooking pot with the traditional Zelda games beloved by so many. The result is a game that can rival the near perfect, polished game that was Ocarina of Time. While not truly innovative (but let's be honest, innovation of a concept is farThis is a game that takes the best aspects of gaming goliaths such as The Elder Scrolls, Dark Souls, Portal, and Assassins creed, then mixes them up in a cooking pot with the traditional Zelda games beloved by so many. The result is a game that can rival the near perfect, polished game that was Ocarina of Time. While not truly innovative (but let's be honest, innovation of a concept is far less important than perfection of that concept), Breath of the Wild brings together dozens of mechanics and systems, both new and old to the series, and blends them all seamlessly to create an intuitive and exhilarating experience that few games can achieve. With so much content and so many ways to tackle that content, this is a game that can keep people enthralled and immersed in the world of Hyrule for dozens of hours with its simple but deep combat system and its fantastic platforming and physics puzzles. While this game is nothing short of a masterpiece, there are minor flaws. It's voice acting is often flat and due to the open nature of the game the story doesn't feel like a pressing matter. The former never really detracted from the experience, but it certainly didn't enhance it, while the latter is simply a tradeoff for the wonderfully open world where players are given enough freedom to make a libertarian blush. The last complaint that I can make and have seen other people make is about framerate. Nintendo does not make strong hardware, they never have, and Breath of the Wild pushes that hardware to the extremes sometimes, resulting in chugging framerates and sometimes even complete pauses in gameplay in the most stressful of situations. This isn't due to poor coding or an unoptimized game (see any Bethesda game), but is due to a hardware limitation fully out of their control. To complain about the game's performance is to complain about the hardware, and because these slowdowns hardly detracted from my enjoyment of the game I can look past them. Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a game that brings together so many amazing things from so many amazing games and blends them seamlessly and intuitively. I cannot articulate how intensely I believe that everyone should play this game. This is the defining game of this generation and if you enjoy RPGs in any capacity this game should be right on the top of your list to buy.…"
10,"Everything in this game is just brilliant and amazing. I've played it for the past day and I just love exploring the map. There's so much to do!One of my favorite things to do is to slide on my shield and flying off ledges"
9,"It's quite funny to see how many people can't stand getting a game a highscore because it isn't available on their platform of choice, It's a huge problem of Metacritic that every **** can rate a game they probably just have seen in a 30seconds commercial. Will I give Horizon Zero Dawn a 0/10 because some Sony Fans have nothing better to do than hating on this great game? No, as soon asIt's quite funny to see how many people can't stand getting a game a highscore because it isn't available on their platform of choice, It's a huge problem of Metacritic that every **** can rate a game they probably just have seen in a 30seconds commercial. Will I give Horizon Zero Dawn a 0/10 because some Sony Fans have nothing better to do than hating on this great game? No, as soon as I'm completely done with Breath of the Wild I will play Horizon Zero Dawn on my PS4 and hopefully enjoy it too. Gosh grow up kids, this is getting ridiculous here.I have to admit, I'm not a huge fan of Open World games and if you are also not a fan of those you probably might end up enjoying Breath of the Wild less than previous games of the franchise. Don't get me wrong, I also play open World games but beside of bugs that are always present - which is kinda fascinating because I haven't seen a single bug in Breath of the Wild, yes it has some slight framerate issues, but nothing that makes it certainly less enjoyable - there are always things that could have turned out better in a less open world. For example Red Dead Redemption (for me a 8/10): it's huge Wild West world is great, has a lot of atmosphere and the story is pretty nice, but - not mentioning other flaws here - a stronger focus on the story would have me pleased more. Sure there are also examples where an open world IMO simply works, but that's mainly because it doesn't get to big which is kinda an issues in most modern open world games, bigger is not always better. Well, Zelda IMO doesn't have these problems, there is always something to do, being it enemy's, something you can hunt, NPC and so on... getting to your goal you might pretty much always find something interesting that can distract you if you wish for it. For it's enormous size it's surely an amazing world, it feels like it's breathing... living and way less like an simple scenery you have to complete your quest in. You don't need quest to enjoy it, but while there are is an enormous amount of smaller sidequest, I wouldn't have mind to have a few more main quest, be it as it be if you can enjoy yourself in a huge sandbox you most likely will love this game. The two biggest issues I have with this game are for once the story, I know you don't have to expect to much from a Zelda game but I have fallen for their trailer and expected that they would finally give us more, this game breaks pretty much all conventions this series has in the last 30years so why not? Yeah... don't expect to much, but if you have seen the trailer you will already know a good chunk of what there is available in form of cut scenes... I surely would love a Zelda game following the events that happened a hundred years ago... unfortunately Breath of the Wild doesn't give me enough to fulfill my expectations. The other issue I have with this game is that it kinda lacks of being ""The Legend of Zelda"", probably I would give it a 9.5-10/10 for being the best Open-World game out there but it wants to be a Zelda and with that in mind you might end up disappointed about all those broken conventions , IMO they took it a little step to far. It wouldn't have hurt the game if all the shrines weren't solvable without Items you HAVE to find in a Dungeon or somewhere in the world, those always have added variety to the Zelda games an I simply miss it, there is a good chunk of shrines but you can solve them all with the functions of the sheikah-slate (and a bow), needing a hammer/boomerang/magic rod which you can find in this world wouldn't have hurt but as a Zelda fan I would have wished for a few big dungeons with ""unbreakable"" Items to find and use in those shrines. Don't get me wrong, those Titans are pretty close to a Zelda Dungeon (beside the bosses not having a certain week point due to the lack of special Items) but just four of these in these BIG open-world wasn't enough to satisfy my thirst for ""The Legend of Zelda"", hell not even Hyrule Castle is a god damn dungeon, why Nintendo? WHY?All in all Breath of the Wild is an amazing Open-World game and on it's own it outshines similar games - while you shouldn't expect a story driven RPG as The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt of course - but as a Zelda it comes a bit short in terms of having big and complex dungeons in which you can get lost for hours, well at least you will find yourself exploring this world for a good chunk of time even if you intend to walk pretty straight to the Titans and beat Ganon.…"
10,"The user-score is clearly being downvoted with ""0/10 scores"" by Xbox, Playstation and PC fanboys. Breath of the Wild is the fourth highest rated game (by critics) EVER. Stop reading reviews and get the game. It's clearly NOT a ""0/10"". The game is a masterpiece and some people are just salty because this game is exclusive for Nintendo platforms."
10,"Exploracion masiva, la musica, la duración, las mecanicas, la historia y lo mas importante, la diversión que este Zelda no se puede comparar con nada en los últimos años"
10,"This game is fantastic. Just play it and you will remember it for the rest of your life. The music are amazing. The gameplay is amazing. And there is so much to do, even after the 50 hour campaign"
10,"This is my 1st Zelda game and this is my first Nintendo. I am amazed, the world is NOT empty. It is filled with puzzled enemy encounters.

You can see explosives inside the cave also but how to detonate them if you don't have any fire arrows? There are couple ways: there is a bonfire nearby and you can fire your arrows and shot the explosives or you can see a fire lamp right inside the cave and you can shot it down with regular arrows. There are so many different ways to accomplish the things and you feel extrimely satisfied when you find out the right way!Atmosphere, battle, controlls, I like everything so far.…"
10,"A return to form for one of the most beloved franchise in video game history. The open world is stunning, interesting and entertaining. Probably the best Zelda ever and maybe the best game ever."
10,"The best game ever!This is no doubt one of the greatest games ever made, and one of the best launch titles of any console ever. It has amazing graphics, world design, story, quests, controls, and must i say more, it is LOZ after all."
10,"Absolutely worthy of the praise it's been getting. I wouldn't even call myself a ""Zelda fan"".

They drop you into this world filled with life and questions and places to explore. You can tackle and single instance the way you want to. Just from the size and activities to do in the first zone, I can tell this is going to be a very long adventure.It looks beautiful, it SOUNDS beautiful (man, all the footstep noises and weapon clinks and detailed sounds are amazing), it feels great to play and it feels open. The only thing to say negative about it is, of course, the frame drops. But that alone is certainly not worth docking a point for. (Especially when the other big brand consoles can't even achieve 1080p@30fps with their current games.)Worth your time, regardless of whether you are a ""Zelda fan"" or not.…"
10,"Wow what a game, an absolute masterpiece!! Nintendo showing the game industry how its done since 1983 and no signs of slowing up, hopefully many more like this to come!"

I will not bring much out on Horizon Zero Dawn here, as I have yet to play it, and will get to it eventually. That game looks freaking awesome.With that out of the way, lets get into the real topic here. The legen of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a masterpiece! I've waited five years for this game and throughout each delay, i knew it would be worth it. Sure, the conventions may have been broken and we have a new layoit for the Zelda series, bt Breath of the Wild is in every way, the way Zelda was supposed to play from the beginning. The gameplay is astonishing, the voice acting is not problematic, and the story is quite the thing to unfold. I understand that there are fears in this games huge open world, but fret not, its full of so many things to do. From the beginning the Breath of the Wild was always focused on this expansive open world. It doesnt force exploration, rather it encourages exploration. In fact, you have many open choices from the beginning. You can go face the final boss right from the start if you feel so inclined to.Breath of the Wild is a true thing of beauty and is worth anyone's time. We only get so many games like this every once in a blue moon. With all that in mind, Breath of the Wild deserves a true 10/10.…"

10,"Simplemente el mejor juego de esta generacion, de nuevo tiene que aparecer Nintendo para recuperar esa magia ya perdida, de tiempos en los que me pasaba horas jugando a la Nintendo 64 y PSX, solo pido que ojala tambien saquen el Zelda WW de Wiiu para Swich :3"

They're insecure that the new Zelda game is leagues above their new exclusive, Horizon. These aren't paid reviews. This game is really this good. Allow me to elaborate.In almost every 3D Zelda, you're put on a liner path that progresses you through the game. While they still incorporated aspects of exploration, they lacked the formula that was present in the original Legend of Zelda. This game puts you through a short tutorial in the beginning and then lets you wonder off. No hand holding. Hyrule becomes your kingdom to explore. The game has also implemented a quest system that is similar to Western RPGs. There is a main story quest and a bunch of side quests. There are also over 100 mini dungeons known as shrines which feature puzzles that greatly vary in design. The gameplay is quite similar to  Dark Souls/Shadow of Colossus. Certain enemy hits will completely deplete your health. Guardians will absolutely destroy you at the beginning. The music is very subtle and its ambience allows you to enjoy the sounds of nature that echo throughout this game. This game is a masterpiece. It scored 98 for a reason. Ignore the user score. Like I said earlier, it's being flooded by insecure Sony fanboys who are upset that this scored way higher than Horizon Zero Dawn. I've played both, and can say without question that this game is superior. Good luck to all of you and I hope you enjoy your adventure in the ruins of Hyrule.…"
