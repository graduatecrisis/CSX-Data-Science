Year,Game,Review
2015,Witcher 3,"Very awesome game, reminds me of Red Dead Redemption, Skyrim, and Dragon Age. Bringing the best of those together in a world bigger than GTA V is truly something magnificent. While also telling a very good and mature story in a beautiful setting. Ladies and Gentlemen... Let me present The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. Say goodbye to life for a while! 10/10"
2015,Witcher 3,"Awsome game, nice graph, awsome story line and voiceover. Controls can be more responsive, but is good camera in fight can be better..  If you looking cool story, and fights this game its for you!"
2015,Witcher 3,"This is one of the best RPG and Open World games ever made. The sheer size of the world is breath taking and attention to detail is staggering. You could argue the graphics took a hit when looking at compressed YT clips or still images but once you play this game on PS4 in the convenience of your home on big-ass TV you will quickly delve headfirst into this immersive world and forget aboutThis is one of the best RPG and Open World games ever made.

You could argue the graphics took a hit when looking at compressed YT clips or still images but once you play this game on PS4 in the convenience of your home on big-ass TV you will quickly delve headfirst into this immersive world and forget about the whole 'downgrade nonesense'. It's the most beautiful open world to date with rock solid gameplay and excellent performance ( day 1 patch is a must for frame-rate dips issues, but after that installed you're good to go).If you consider Polish studio with only 200 strong staff and half the budget of EA, Ubisoft are pumping into the same crap year after year, you will quickly realize how exceptional in all aspects Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is.I could go on and praise this game all day long but I have quests to do, and then some.10/10 Must Buy or GTFO. ;)\"
2015,Witcher 3,The best RPG i have ever played. Amazing character creation. Nicely designed quests. Very rich bestiary. World map is very big and full of content. Almost no loading screens!
2015,Witcher 3,"Amazing game with great gameplay and story. This game is while the third in the series, is still a great jumping point and CD Projekt Red has done a good job at explaining the backstory. Granted playing the other games and reading the books will allow you to get more out of it, playing this game is still a must for anyone with a ps4, xbox one or a pc strong enough to run it."
2015,Witcher 3,"Best RPG game ever ! Large diverse open world , mass quests, addictive gameplay . For such a game I waited and did not deceived. Congratulations to the Polish developer."
2015,Witcher 3,"Ive have only played this game for some 22 hours now, and I haven't even left the starting area yet. Im simply in awe of the beauty of this game, constantly finding myself just starring at the screen and the changing environment. I haven't seen this much attention to detail since GTA V, and that is the only other game on the current gen consoles i would give a 10.

2015,Witcher 3,"This will go down as one of the best rpg's ever created.  It's mind blowing in scope and quality and very refreshing to have an adult oriented rpg.  This is a harsh, realistic and brutal world"
2015,Witcher 3,"One of the best games ever made. Swimming mechanics need some tweaking, but this is not enough to rid it of a deserved 10/10. A masterpiece of art and gameplay."
2015,Witcher 3,"This is officially the best game of all time! It's beautiful, combat is perfection and everything was  created so incredibly that I would want to live in this world forever! Reality has become obsolete now!;-)Thanks CD projekt red ! You are by far the best game developer in history! Love you all!!;-)"
2015,Witcher 3,"May I call The Witcher 3 ""Adult version of Dragon Age Inquisition''? Or same level as Skyrim? Because of the amazing story, fantastic living open world. I'm going to spent hundreds of hours into this game ^^"
2015,Witcher 3,"This is not only great game but also, a great story! It is deep and exciting without ""fedex' quests. That' is something that for example Dragon Age definately was missing."
2015,Witcher 3,"Take a bit of Skyrim, Red Dead Redemption, The Wolf Among Us and add following ingrediences: most beautiful and dense open World ever created, hard but rewarding combat and the most memorable side quests ever created from which many are dramatic storylines on its own. This masterpiece is what you get!"
2015,Witcher 3,"Fantastic game, the world is so dynamic and huge it's truly incredible. There is alot of stuff to do, the characters are interesting and the plot as in all games is great. If you're an RPG fan than you should immediately  get this game!"

2015,Witcher 3,"this game is 3 time amazing and best RPG game ever i playing.  story, graphic, gameplay/combat and voice acting are top Notch. there are some weird glitches during gameplay like my horse got stuck against fence that it can't get out of fence. framerate sometimes dip during cutscenes and gameplay. i recommend this game to everyone : this game is worth 60 bucks"

2015,Witcher 3,"An extraordinary game with stunning visuals and details. Great storytelling, fun RPG elements and a breathtaking atmosphere. A good example what a ''next gen'' game should be!"

2015,Witcher 3,"Beautiful world. Mature gameplay and story.True next gen. RPG. Recommended to all B&G I and II, PTorrment, Fallout 1,2 fans.  Deserved 10 out of 10. With free DLCs this game will get only better overtime."
2015,Witcher 3,"One of the best games I ever played. Beautiful graphics, compelling story, addictive game play, large and diverse open world, perfect combat, a lot of interesting side quests. I have to take few days off now..."
2015,Witcher 3,"I haven't even opened the box yet and I'm excited. Giving it 10/10 cause it has horses in it. What also helps is that Geralt seems to have a beard in this one, and I am a fan of beards. I find them comforting."
2015,Witcher 3,One of the best RPGs I've played by far makes skyrim and dragon age inquestition look awful if you haven't got it already I highly recommend you do it's full of content that will keep you from going out doors for days
2015,Witcher 3,"What a staggering disappointment.First off: The controls of Geralt is an abomination.Everyone do this test; Watch how in his first two steps after you first push on the controller, they are really slow steps, and then he moves into stride - It's terrible. What precision and control is possible with that ?Then this test: run straight and then immediately push directly left or rightWhat a staggering disappointment.First off: The controls of Geralt is an abomination.Everyone do this test; Watch how in his first two steps after you first push on the controller, they are really slow steps, and then he moves into stride - It's terrible. What precision and control is possible with that ?Then this test: run straight and then immediately push directly left or right on your gamepad - after that turn, Geralt stops slowly, turns like a slow moving robot, and then moves again. It's insane.The basis of the main characters movement has gigantic flaws that makes this game unplayable.Not only that but all his movement is sugglish and non-resonsive, and when the combat is difficulty already, it makes the gameplay in the Witcher 3 an exercise in endless frustration. And it was built this way. AMAZING.The players animation when on rocks, against trees, sliding down a hill etc, is all terrible. The physical connection of Geralt to this nice looking world when exploring, is awful.If they fixed the controls, the combat would still be really boring. None of the early enemies showed much intelligence or proved an interesting or visceral fight. Hit by weapon animation when you hit the enemies leaves no strong impact, and the AI behaviour in combat very soon into the game feels very repetitive. Sure you have some strategy with the Signs, but it's still in a dull combat system against plain enemies.The positive: is that some of the writing is vastly improved from the Witcher 2, and even most games.But you have to spend such a long time traversing what is a pretty nice designed world, but that setting quality is still not high enough on it's own and for all that imposed length extending traversal imperative, or as compensation for the really poor controls and gameplay.\"

RPG's live and die  by how well their combat system is received, and this game's combat system is an unintuitive, poorly-timed and oddly-keystroked mess.See all those good reviews? I'm pretty sure they're all just too mesmerized by how good the graphics look. It's a shame the way you interface with them is such a turd.\"

The controls are really bad, how could they destroy something so simple, but very essential for a game !!?? The graphics are okay but nothing special ..

2015,Witcher 3,"Witcher 3's combat gameplay is just horrible, i just bought it because everyone is praising it.Gameplay is medicore at best to be honest. I agree with people saying Witcher 3 have good story. But what good is story if the gameplay sucks. Might as well be watching a movie then? When it comes to games, GAMEPLAY is more important than STORY.This game have the same problem as BioshockWitcher 3's combat gameplay is just horrible, i just bought it because everyone is praising it.Gameplay is medicore at best to be honest. I agree with people saying Witcher 3 have good story. But what good is story if the gameplay sucks. Might as well be watching a movie then? When it comes to games, GAMEPLAY is more important than STORY.This game have the same problem as Bioshock Infinite. As good as people say it is. The story is all it is good for. The combat is lackluster and I would rather watch Bioshock Infinite as a movie than play the game. I would rather watch people play the game than playing it myself.This is coming from a guy who enjoys Dark Souls, Monster Hunter series, God Eater, etc.And we all know how much dodging and rolling there is in games like Monster Hunter.But Witcher 3's rolling is just.. Unsatisfying, overly obsessive rolling and spinning.Monster Hunter's rolling = precise timing to dodge a hit that would otherwise kill you. Rolling eats up your stamina bar so every roll has it's purpose.Witcher 3's rolling = You might as well be the Tasmanian Devil. Because spinning and rolling is the new style. I think Geralt is dancing and spinning like a fool when he attacks and its always the same.He does switch the swords automaticly in this game.CAMERA while fighting is the worst CAMERA i have ever seen in a videogame, really and this game has such a high rating?Story is good, but for the most part people are talking nonsense when you speak with them.graphics have a downgrade but are still looking good.this game is a let down like destiny, the order and watchdogs to be honest and it doesnt live up to the hype.My hopes are Batman and MGS5.\"
2015,Witcher 3,"Most of the things in this game are very good.. BUT!!!!! The camera and controls in general, are just unbelievably bad. It is clumsy and unprecisly, makes it a little difficult to loot sometimes, some fight combats looks a bit ugly because of it, and it is just enoying that you run around/running into things and people like a confussed animal or something.

If you have played the buggy Assasins Creed then you probably know little about how it feels like.It irritates me, cause this game got so much potentiale. It have potential of course, but the bad controls just ruins the experience a bit. I really dont see the point about making a game with that much content, without making some of the most important basic things optimal. It feels like the game is unfinished, and i would LOVE if they could patch this problem, then it would be a really good game.\"
2015,Witcher 3,"World is big yet boring, there is too much of the same stuff. Combat is too repetitive. Text is too small. Geralt has a bad voice.  Stroy is full of cliche stuff. An immensely overhyped game. Expected something more original."

The gameplay is only slightly choppy but it ruins the whole experience. How on earth anyone can rate this game highly is beyond me. I went to a friends house and their game played the same. This would be a great game if the choppy/jerky camera was sorted out. It is going back tomorrow and is the biggest disappointment of the year for me.If they had saved the money spent on the 'free extra crap' and spent it on development this could have been epic. Alas no though.\

2015,Witcher 3,What an unmitigated piece of crap ! Controls and mechanics from the 1990's were enough for me to stop after an hour and ask for a refund on this overhyped nonsense.

Now for the negative, boring monotone protaganist gave me little insentive to care about the story. Mature themes felt awkward not exciting. The combat was beyond clunky. Enemies were uninteresting and bland. The spells had no appeal or flash. The menus were combersome. The inventory was filled with way too many items that served no purpose until dozens of hours into the game. Repairing items was a frustrating nightmare. The ""puzzles"" were a lesson in boredom. Seriously using your witcher sense to find clues was such an abysmal waste of time. Swimming sections were nothing but frustration. The difficulty scaling was terrible, mid game fights were often very difficult then suddenly a breeze at end game. The lore felt to me like a game of thrones wannabe, that's just a personal gripe if you are into that sort of genre you'd enjoy it more. Overall a huge living world with endless side quests, hiding a boring repetitve fetch quest filled gameplay experience.\"

The story, at least for me, was pretty boring and forgetful, the quest to find Ciri gets annoying real quick, and the formula is just: watch some cutscene and dialogues, fight some enemies, find some stuff, fight more enemies... and so on, the choice system is not much o relevant, at least on main quest, since the only choices that really matters are the ones that happens at when you're almost finishing it. For the positive side, i really like the sidequests and there is a lot of items to collect and things to do even after you beat the game, but i lost my save file so in order to pick the items i have to play that game again, and this won't be happening, at leasy by now.In conclusion i think that Witcher 3 has some great aspects, but it0 is incredible overhyped and i dont think it really deserves the praise.\"

Even the magic is bad: the symbols are so similar with each other. They could at least make some different icons more related with the actual power.Sure it's better than a great number of games.

One thing I hated while playing this on PlayStation 4 is that they had dulled the graphics down to a point where there was no point in making it about the graphics but they still pushed it to a point where it struggles to run on average PS4s. The fact that the game was constantly dipping into the 20 FPS range was not good and made a mediocre game even worse. Let's see, the universe is all right. The story is absolutely dog **** and confusing but if you ignore it and look around at the universe then that's the enjoyable part. The story is just so bland there's no point in praising it. The story is just an excuse for the horrible gameplay. Go here because A said so. Well B isn't where A said he was better find him. Oh C told me B is over at D. Turns out B isn't at D better find B. That's the level of depth we're talking about here. The actual gameplay is super boring. It's slow, clunky, and a mixture of too easy and hard. I was able to beat a boss standing still with my thumb on one button but as soon as I see a level 1 dog I'm dead because it just runs by and attacks me similar to an AoE attack without slowing down. Geralt is too slow to do anything. Buy the game to say you played it but save the reciept.\"

The game is colossal & amazingly excellent in every perspective.World Design :Game world is colossal & gorgeous, excellently designed with exclusive & extensive details such as fallen trees are regrown just like in real life, burned or cut down portions of forests, Dead whale on a shore & various type of fish under water are just very few such examples.It is a Living breathing world monsters will also attack other animals, wolves will hunt rabbits & dears. During cloudy weather you will be able to see clouds moving in the sky & shooting stars at night.Game have excellently implemented dynamic weather cycle, day and night cycle as you will see a dramatic difference between day and night life.Visuals :Graphically game is stunning and even more gorgeous after the latest patch. Animations are top class and facial animations are impressive.Narrative :Story is impressive and easy to understand, no matter how many or all the side quests you play; you still wont get lost. Game offers the opportunity to enjoy company of beautiful characters & decent humor.Choosing dialogues is one of the best part of the game & Dialogue options are one of the best with various types of choices with provides an enjoyable experience.Unique Features :Witcher 3 have some unique features that you wont find any where else such as Geralt beard physics. Other examples are :- On Skellige : Gedyneith (Name Of Place) there is A House Under A tree when you visit that place for the 1st time you will see a dude plowing in soil but when you go there later you will see plants. You will see many changes in dandelions inn & main hall in Kaer Trolde castle throughout the game.Combat :Combat is enjoyable, addictive, tactical and superb both ways offensive & defensive. AI is intelligent & will use various defensive measures. Despite high level enemies you still can defeat them with tactics & patience.Other than basic close combat and ranged weapon, there are bombs & sign abilities (Basically Magic). You can use your ability points on skills but will choose wisely b/z you cant acquire them all as it is an RPG With choices & consequences, But you can reset them with potion.Other activities :Beside side quests there are witcher contracts and treasure hunting, you can also participate in horse racing, boxing & playing cards. The card game is also very fun & extremely addictive.Replayability :I doubt that some one will play this game once as of the colossal dialogue choices. The game felt vastly different while selecting different dialogues through second game play. I finished it twice and i am gone buy Complete addition & play it all over again.\"

The Witcher 3 refines everything you know and love about this franchise.The story and characters in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt are amazing. A side quest-line can be deeper and more meaningful than the main story of many other AAA titles out there. The ways characters interact with you and other NPCs is great and you really feel immersed in the world of The Witcher. The voiceovers are also really good and give life to these characters.The World is huge in this game and the locals so diverse. From swamps, to mountains, to grassy fields, to big cities, everything in The Witcher is fun to explore. The game is breathtakingly beautiful.Gameplay has been upgraded tremendously from the previous games and is a joy to play. Fighting and signs mechanics were improved and much easier to use. At the time I write this review, the menus have been re-hauled making everything much better from a UI standpoint.The only negative point I can give the game is the horse mechanics. Horse controls can be very frustrating at times. I've ended up just jumping off the horse and running quite a few times. Yet, that is not enough for me to give this game less than a 10.I'm also not counting the paid DLC in this review (tho I have played both and highly recommend them).This is my Game of the Decade! Please, go get it and play it!P.S Gwent is awesome!\"

Some amazing characters populate this game\s world, and some side missions will highlight amazing storyline that unfortunately, seem to end all too quickly due to their nature of being just side quests.Like many other overrated titles to come out in recent memory (like The last of us and Horizon Zero Dawn) I found myself disappointed with The Witcher 3 all throughout its uninteresting story. There are definitely better games on the market, and if you\re looking for a deep action rpg experience, I would honestly look elsewhere.\"
2015,Witcher 3,Absolutely amazing game.We have idiots rating this 0/10 because of his troubles with his PC. DONT PLACE THIS **** IN CONSOLE REVIEVS SECTION....Graphics and atmosphere of Poland just pours out of the screen. If Youre not from Poland and want to spend vacation in this country all You have to do is launch Witcher 3.One of the best games ever created - do Yourself a favour and try this one out.
2015,Witcher 3,"After experiencing Witcher 2 on the Xbox 360 I was hesitant to jump back into the world of Geralt of Rivea.

I wasn't the biggest fan of the combat at the time and felt that the multiple aspects had a hard time transitioning to the console. However after having a drought in games to play I decided to jump into Witcher 3 a few months after launch, and it was the biggest mistake I could have made because I should have got it on Day 1. Even before inserting the disc into the game I was greeted with an insert from the developer thanking me for giving there a game a chance by purchasing it. Never before have I as a consumer, in any form of entertainment or product, felt that the people who worked on something truly valued the support I was giving them. But back to the game itself. For whatever reason I decided to play the game on the hardest difficulty, which I completely recommend of anyone whose played any open world game or rpg like Skyrim or Red Dead, and was pretty much stopped in my tracks by any horde of enemies. However the most pleasure from this game is in the preparation required to defeat enemies using such as signs, potions and oils to defeat enemies. Overcoming a hard boss that you've prepared for or finishing a long string of quests to unfold more of the story in Witcher 3 brings more excitement then I've ever felt for a game before, and that's because of the incredibly detailed open world rivaling the likes of The Elder Scrolls and Grand Theft Auto. Even the mini game of Gwent has become a phenomenon in itself and I feel heavily compelled to play every npc in this card game just so i can get access to new rare cards, an online component would have been amazing, but a separate game such as on the app store, the PlayStation store or Xbox marketplace would be an instant purchase for me. The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt is a 10 out of 10 for me, its a beautifully detailed open world rpg that deserves a look.\"
2015,Witcher 3,"What an amazing game!!!. So I don't usually write reviews but I finished playing this game about 2 weeks ago and thought it was really good.

The graphics are superb I've never seen a game that made me be proud I have a nextgen system as much as this game did. The voice acting is pretty goodWhat an amazing game!!!.

The graphics are superb I've never seen a game that made me be proud I have a nextgen system as much as this game did. The voice acting is pretty good (it took me a bit to get over geralt sounding like batman though). The body languange and facial expressions are what make interacting with people so good though. Sometimes I felt like I was watching a movie instead of playing a game.This game has some serious glitches though an elusive gwent card glitch make it nearly impossible to get the ""collect em all trophy"" making a platinum sometimes completely impossible. There is quest where you get locked into a dungeon and seriously your only way out is using a different glitch. The horse mechanics are kinda clunky. Sometimes I sheathe my sword in the middle of battle which can get really frustrating. This happens a lot when I'm fighting humanoid creatures like dongs and monsters at the same time and have to switch between swords. Well sometimes I sheathe one and never pull out the other. I've had quests that don't complete the way they should too.That being said this game is freaking so fun. I absolutely loved the gwent side game what a blast. I wish fallout 4 were half as good as this game..... or if walmart had a better return policy on video games but thats for a different rant. If you haven't played this game  you need to it's the most enjoyable single player experience I've had on a nextgen console. Lastly you can't go wrong when you put in a pair (or a hundred) of real ta tas lol. Honestly this title must have put the ESRB through the ringer. Anyway this game is freaking amazing play it they play it again they get the dlc and play that.\"

I enjoyed every single side quest and monster contract I took on. Every single one. Which is really rare...because i have come to expect LESS from game companies these days after a series of ""AAA"" disappointments from North American studios.Just when you think you know where the sub-plot in a quest is going, it takes a twist. And another twist. And you are faced with REAL, CONSEQUENTIAL decisions. Not the meaningless **** decisions that have zero effect on the game world you will find in Bethesda's Fallout 4.Consider this, I have not played any previous Witcher games, and I have no idea what a Witcher even was before playing this game. However it completely drew me in. I couldn't stop playing. I think I've put in more than 50-60 hours playing at a leisurely pace, and finished the main story and all the main side quests. Yet I have explore only 25-30% of the OPEN world portion of the game. There are VAST forests and caverns with interesting, useful loot, and monsters roaming the wilds that I have yet to kill.I cannot say enough good things about this game. Maybe because I've been so disappointed by the shallow, soulless ""products"" made by North American studios: Fallout 4, Diablo 3, Farcry 4, WatchDogs,\"

The Witcher 3 has become an example of what open world RPG's should be like. There isn't one section of land in this game which feels like it's been copied and pasted from somewhere else, or rushed together. The buildings, towns and cities have been built into the landscape, but gives you the feel of being transported into another world, which strangley feels real (even though you're fighting Griffins and casting magical signs!). I loved every second of The Witcher 3 and even though I was sad to come to the end of the main story, I quickly realised I still had much more to do. The only small negative I have is that I felt like I was leveling too quickly towards the end of the game, which made me feel a bit over powed, even though I was at the recommended level for that particular quest and I also felt that the inventory screen could've been better thought out (even after the patch which changed this screen). Overall, I love The Witcher 3 and I'll be playing it for a long time.\"

This weekend, after being disgusted with the amount of critical acclaim the Witcher achieved over Fallout 4, I decided to do intense research and practice with the game and I will say it is incredible. Better than Fallout 4 in nearly every aspect.Writing: Honestly one of the best quests I have ever played. The writing is fantastic, the quests are fun, emotional, and somtimes, funny. The characters are also quite good. I love the personalities in particular of Geralt and the Baron.Graphical: The graphics are nice. Water is very well done. The lighting and environment is very nice. Nothing unique per se, just realistic medieval and wilderness graphics. The monsters and armors are very creative; some look cool as **** (Wild Hunt Armor), and some look downright disgusting (Rotfiends, Botchlings).Technical: The game runs at 1080p, 30 FPS on the PS4, typical with many console games. The combat is decent, the only really bad thing I have to say, but it is still quite good. It requires strategy rather than hacking the **** out of someone as say the Elder Scrolls. Movement can be a bit sticky too, I've accidentally fallen off of ledges quite a bit.Overall: So damn good. You will probably love it if you're patient and willing to learn in the game and outside of the game (YouTube, Reddit).\"

Yet, with The Witcher 3, developer CD Projekt Red proves that it's still possible to have a seriously amazing experience without necessarily innovating the genre's tried-and-true foundations.The game puts you on the shoes of Geralt of Rivia, a witcher (monster hunter) who roams the Northern Realms in search of Cirilla, his foster daughter, who is being chased by a supernatural army called the Wild Hunt. Having not played any of the previous titles, I found myself initially intimidated by the storyline background; luckily, the game's tale is written in such a way that you can mostly ignore the finer details of Geralt's previous sagas if you want to.The story itself is likely to please fantasy fans. It is a fittingly epic tale which uses the invasion of the Northern Realms by the southern Nildgaardian empire as a background, and it's reasonably fun and interesting. It does have its fair share of clichs and at least a couple of significant dei ex-machina (I'm looking at you, Dudu the Doppler) that render it hard to be taken entirely seriously as a piece of adult-oriented storytelling, however.In his adventure, Geralt roams several open spaces through the Northern Realms. The landscapes look absolutely gorgeous, filled with impressive lighting effects and extremely detailed textures. One of my favorite aspects of the setting is how it mixes traditional fantasy with a bit of horror, leading to some pretty scary enemies and scenarios, but without resorting to cheap jump-scares.There is a lot of ground to cover in the several open-world environments, with numerous towns, villages, sidequests and hidden secrets to keep you busy. Roaming the land in search of experience and loot is extremely satisfying, thanks in good part to the intuitive controls and the fluid action (no, there's not a single quick-time event to tell of, thank you very much). Like any good RPG, there are also extensive options to craft and/orr buy gear, weapon, potions and assorted items, which manage to be intricate without getting overwheming.There is only one significant deviation from this formula: gwent, a simple strategy card game, played by Geralt and several NPCs, in which you amass an army (represented by separate character cards) and control the weather to defeat opponents. As basic as it is, it's a surprisingly addictive little diversion, and sometimes I found myself setting the main adventure aside just to wind off against NPCs and win new cards.Basically, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt plays brilliantly, looks gorgeous, and offers dozens upon dozens of hours for you to lose yourself in its very appealing brand of horror-tinged fantasy. With its compelling world, an equipment/potion/addon system that is deep yet easy to grasp, and a set of main quest missions that doesn't try to break its own boundaries in annoying ways, you have one of the best releases of the year for fans of epic adventures.Rating: 9.0\"

2015,Witcher 3,"One of the best RPGs i've ever played, a deeply emotional plot storyline, awesome cast of characters, Contracts are probably one of the most amazing side-quests that i've ever played, and of course an vast open world with a lot to do and to investigate, and a perfect sountrack... A few visual bugs, but nothing to seriously, i recommend to every RPG fan."

I was really on the spot about this game because I was deciding if I should buy this or Fallout 4, and I dont regret it, every minute of my playthrough was worth the price, this is truely an awesome RPG, if not one of the best RPG (one problem tho, controlling Geralt feels clunky and hard)\"
2015,Witcher 3,"At last a game worth playing on the PS4. You have to be online to play the free downloadable content, otherwise saved games will not load. Otherwise very good."

Everything is interactive, and it all looks so beautiful.The storyline is simple, yet it definitely gets your attention. I geniually care about Geralt and Ciri and most of the other supporting characters. I thought Tess and Zoltan were both great.The controls take a while to get a hold of but that's a good thing. I don't want to just smash the x-button the entire time I play a game. The witcher, and the many different villains that you fight require you to constantly change up your strategy in combat. I like that. Makes it interesting. Keeps it from getting stale.i love the different types of quests in the game. Some of the Witcher contracts have a nice sense of horror to them. Then there are some (the threesome quest) that have some funny moments to them.Gwent is one of the best in-game games I've ever experienced. You can literally just play that game for hundreds of hours.If you are a gamer, I would definitely suggest to play this on the hardest level. I played on normal and it was too easy so i went back and put the difficulty alll of the way up, and it was a much more challenging experience but made me feel much more satisfied.lastly, without giving too much away, Ciri is one of my favorite characters of all-time. Like Ellie from the Last of Us, I truly started to get emotionally attached to Ciri. I wanted her to be happy and I'm glad that I got the Witcher ending. I would have felt really empty had I thought Ciri died. I would be willing to play the entire game as Ciri btw, who is very fun to use in combat.This was the best game of the year.  A true masterpiece. I really need a Witcher 4 in my life\"

2015,Witcher 3,"The Witcher III: Wild Hunt is actually the best story driven RPG I've ever played.

It's world and lore very rich in detail and so beautiful that I usually stop to admire the landscapes - something I rarely do in games. The maps are very big, with tons of Witcher activities to carry out, and alive too with monsters in habitats and humans in villages, that actually sometimes collide, resulting in the deaths of entire villages. Gameplay relies on you, the player's knowledge of how, and when monsters attack, what their weaknesses are, and what tools to use. Basically it's a role-playing game that gets the job of role-playing done - where you, the player, are put into the role of Geralt of Rivia. You are made to try to think like him, immerse yourself in the character, and be him. All the while, maybe adding a bit of your personality to him, to decide what's right or wrong in the game. Choices also actually affect how the game ends. It's the first game to actually get me somewhat teary eyed in the ending.Also, don't mind those people who complained that the PC version took a hit in the graphical area. The graphics are still beautiful and PC people are just-- ugh.All in all, this game is a great end to Geralt of Rivia's story. Get it when you can.\"

2015,Witcher 3,Over 160 hours and I still couldn't get enough of this game. Witcher 3 is a masterfully crafted tale with some really amazing gameplay and characters. CD Project Red really deserves a round of applause for their effort.
2015,Witcher 3,"The Witcher 3 is set in a fantasy medieval land with the Nilfgaard army invading the land, playing as Geralt you must find your one time ward Ciri and defeat the Wild Hunt, a group of elves from a different dimension trying to capture Ciri. This incredibly beautiful open world is fantastically presented and I found myself frequently making use of the ps4's share button to uploadThe Witcher 3 is set in a fantasy medieval land with the Nilfgaard army invading the land, playing as Geralt you must find your one time ward Ciri and defeat the Wild Hunt, a group of elves from a different dimension trying to capture Ciri. This incredibly beautiful open world is fantastically presented and I found myself frequently making use of the ps4's share button to upload screenshots of the incredible scenery. The main storyline is one to be remembered for years as it keeps you interested at all times and is very easy to follow, even allowing you to make your own decisions in order to change the outcome of the game as well as causing changes to specific characters and even communities. If you weren't told otherwise, you'd think side quests were a part of the main story, with some side quests significantly affecting what happens to some characters, such as who will be the king/queen of Skellige or what will happen to King Radovid. Scavenger hunts and witcher contracts provide a nice alternative to the main story for a bit of money or to help level up your character. CD Projekt RED clearly didn't become lazy when creating side quests as they are excellent. One of the amazing things that CD Projekt RED did was allow new players (such as myself) to fully understand the lore of the game and the background of the characters despite the fact that this is the third game in its series. As is almost a requirement for any RPG game is a good combat system, and The Witcher 3 does not disappoint, simple fast attacks and heavy attacks make up the general swordplay but the use of rolls, dodges and parries allow for a more complex defensive part of combat and the addition of magic elements such as bombs, oils, potions and signs fulfills the RPG aspect of the game. General enemies are simple to take down, yet not at all repetitive and the boss battles are something else, huge elves known as the Wild Hunt make up the main bosses, wearing badass armour and having a huge amount of health combined with unique abilities such as teleporting or summoning elementals keep you on your toes and alert at all times make for some of the best boss fights I've ever seen. Sticking with the subject, the end battle is magnificent with not one but two bosses and the combination of fighting as both Ciri and Geralt adds an original twist to the already spectacular game. The only things that could be altered with this game are the occasionally glitchy movement system, often you'll find yourself unable to open a chest or loot a body and the walking and running can sometimes feel unnatural. As well as this, as somewhat of a newcomer to RPGs, at the beginning of the game I found it slightly difficult to fully understand some elements of the game such as magic items and the ability trees and so would recommend taking your time at the beginning to make sure you read the tutorials and completely understand them. In conclusion, this game completely amazed me, the incredible amount of content that is in this game is phenomenal and every aspect can't be faulted. It is definitely one of the best, if not the best game I have ever played and I would highly recommend it to anyone. The lack of multiplayer may deter some gamers however anyone will enjoy The Witcher 3, regardless of whether they usually prefer multiplayer or singleplayer. I have given The Witcher 3 a score of 10 because of the following reasons:Strengths:- Fantastic storyline- Impressive graphics- Interesting, exciting side quests- Highly entertaining boss battles- Good combat systemWeaknesses:- Occasional glitches- Unnatural movement\"

2015,Witcher 3,Thought the game was very well done. Geralt of Rivia returns in the Witcher 3. This game is the most cohesive and in depth version of any witcher game to date. I'm a big fan of the souls games and bloodborne. If you crank that difficulty up to death march this game becomes very fun. It was very immersive to have to prepare for each battle against a monster.

2015,Bloodborne,This is a From Software game. If you hate yourself and you like games that hate you too this friends is the game for you. Beautiful art great sound design and is dripping with atmosphere if you liked the souls series you will love this game.
2015,Bloodborne,"Dark Souls game play - but lose the dying fantasy ascetic and gain the horror inspiration I have been dying for.  Now that this game is finally out I feel as if it was made for me.....

Now that this game is finally out I feel as if it was made for me.....  I honestly cant complain about too much in the game as I feel that every change is a natural evolution of the series - but if I HAD to complain about one thing it would be removal of ""true loot"" from NPC's (as in the NPC dropping a piece of loot it is USING/WEARING).  This is a big change, but with the addition of a horror ascetic it seems a natural progression (No WAY to peel armor/ weapons of of half the weird-azz enemies n this game).  One thing I really like about this game that I found VERY lacking in Dark Souls 2 is the connected over-world (but with a hub-world).  Lovers of DS1 rejoice...all roads lead back to fire-link...kinda.  IMO this game combines the best of demons/dark souls 1 without including the DS2 stuff that turned me away.\"
2015,Bloodborne,"So satisfying and rewarding, totally recommended to anyone, regardless of whether you like Dark Souls or not, in fact if you didn't like Dark Souls for the combat then this negates that with it being faster and more aggressive so even non-DS fans might love it."

It's really tight and the graphics they look damn good as well the framerate is better than I thought it would be. Definitely a buy worth your time."

2015,Bloodborne,"As a fan of the series Souls declare, Bloodborne great game. Gaming immersion, the soundtrack, graphics - all at altitude. From Software have tried and not disgraced in front of their fans. Emotions overflowed, do not even know how to pass ..."
2015,Bloodborne,Bloodborne is amazing and as close to perfection as you can get. Clearly the 0 reviews on this site are designed to bring the game score down. No game is worthy unless it's completely broken. Don't believe the hate and pick this up if you have a PS4!
2015,Bloodborne,"This game is great one of the best on the ps4 and definitely much better I mean way better than that order of 1886, I shouldn't compare those two but my example and reasoning is is that one puts more focus on gameplay than just showing off graphics and quick time events."
2015,Bloodborne,"Early ""review"" after three hours of play. It's Dark Souls on crack. It's really good, about the only reason to have a PS4 if you've already got a PC, and it's totally worth every penny."
2015,Bloodborne,"The best in the series so far. Great sound, dark and greedy, large amount of content and re-playability.The best part of submitting this comment is watching the negative user submitted scores crying for a PC port of the game. X-mas came early :)"
2015,Bloodborne,"Amazing game, great soundtrack, game play, The enemies and environment design is amazing too , a little weird AF and have some frames drops, I don't care about the loading (I play to not die) but everything else is amazing, love this game.For me GOTY"
2015,Bloodborne,"Much like its spiritual predecessors, Bloodborne has the capability to occupy nearly all of your waking thoughts, whether it be through figuring out how to defeat a certain boss or further delve into its massive world.

2015,Bloodborne,"Bloodborne is superb!!! What an amazing game. Good graphics, epic bosses and cool story. I really enjoy my time when I'm playing. By the way, playing with friends is even better. Party with 2 friends and you can have a lot of fun. Well, thats it. Worth every penny."

2015,Bloodborne,"I really enjoyed the game. Artwork. Thank you for the excellent work and dedication to this game so wonderful and beautiful. Well done Sony. I'm cheering when that Unchart 4 among other much better. Even The 1866 order not pleasing to many, I liked it."
2015,Bloodborne,"Another great game by Miyazaki and FROM Software. Bloodborne, a spiritual successor to the Souls' series, takes everything to the next level. Beautiful graphics and Art Direction as always, brilliant new twist to the combat mechanics, and wow is the game as challenging as ever. Perfect in every way, minus loading times, which I'm sure they will patch."

2015,Bloodborne,"Bloodborne, the spiritual successor to Demon's/Dark Souls, is perhaps the best game released this year. Each boss, weapon, and environment has been meticulously designed, and the world is a dark yet engrossing one that will hook you in for hours."
2015,Bloodborne,"It's everything Dark Souls was, cranked up to 11. This is the best non-remake game on new gen yet. (The Last of Us was one of my favorite games of all time, however).This is  a system seller if there ever was one. Hard, but not in stupid ways. It challenges you to be better and you will, or you will die repeatedly."

Bloodborne feels like one of the Souls Games in many ways but still manages to bring fresh ideas to the mix. Besides that: Bloodborne is more accessible than the Souls games but still really challenging.The combat offers a great risk & reward system due to it's lack of defensive options like heavy shields or armor and even though this feels pretty strange in the beginning, you get use to it pretty fast. And when you face one of the first two bosses you realize, that you have to go with the now combat flow - and that it's awesome! Rushing around the battlefield, poking and dodging your enemy feels pretty rewarding and makes a lot of fun.Graphics are great and really atmospheric, some minor framedrops sometimes annoy a bit, but besides that everything is fine.There are not as many weapons but the ""few"" you've got are absolutely great. Every weapon has two modes which you can choose and which give them another feel to it but the weapons itself are pretty creative and different and offer a lot of different playstyles.There is so much more I could say, since I'm playing it since Saturday, but only that much: Bloodborne is the first game of this gen, that doesn't only fulfill it's promises, it even surpasses them. Besides the rare framedrops and the long loading times (up to 30-40secs, sometimes) there is not much bad to say about Bloodborne. The first GOTY candidate and definately worth a look, at least.\"

A far cry from Dark Souls 2 / 1 where some bosses are pretty much just re-hashes of another boss you fought.The game is not linear at all either, there's a lot of exploration to be done, it feels more like dark souls 1 in the exploration aspect. Combat is tight as always. And best of all. This game has such an overarching feeling of dread and loneliness that we've come to love in a souls game.If you're concerned like I was about how much you'd enjoy it, don't be, this is genuinely an entertaining ( albeit rage-inducing ) experience that I haven't felt in a while.Tl;dr : This is hard and feels oppressive as **** while being extraordinarily fair, if you die you know it's your fault/lack of understanding. .

This is not passive entertainment like so many other attempts at gameplay.  From Software demands focus from the player.If you're at all familiar with Demon's Souls or Dark Souls (and to a lesser extent Dark Souls II), you should have a decent primer in what to expect here as far as difficulty is concerned.  It's not difficult in the same way poorly designed games of yesteryear were difficult.  Quite the contrary.  The difficulty of the game comes from subverting a players expectations when booting a game up.  There are so many titles that aim to place the player in a position of power, one wherein the perceived danger is just enough to cyclically communicate small accomplishments at a rapid pace, pushing the player further.  Bloodborne isn't as interested in patting players on the back and offering a gold star for participation.Bloodborne offers an oppressive world that is never unfair.  It communicates clearly what it expects from you and punishes you in kind for not following the rules that it lays out. If you learn.  If you endure.  Every victory will bring genuine fulfillment.The graphics are some of the best available to the current generation of games, with the occasional framerate hiccup.  These performance issues may detract for some people, but they have not compromised my ability to play the game in the slightest.  They do, however, momentarily break immersion during intense fights.  Hopefully this is something that can be patched.  The load times are also frustrating - partly because of their actual length, but also because I just want to get back to the game.I'll return to this review as I experience more and will flesh it out to include specific gameplay mechanics.  That being said, if you're reading these reviews, you already have an idea of what to expect.  If it is validation you seek, Bloodborne is the first truly essential current gen game.\"

A very fun system indeed. My tip: your health regenerates proportional to your damage, so a high damage weapon with a quick lead time is the ideal weapon to exploit regain.Another tip: if you're frustrated with a boss fight, or keep dying in an area, go somewhere else. The world is large, and you may have just taken a wrong turn :)I am having an absolute blast with this game... although, not sure WTF is going on with the story.

2015,Bloodborne,"This is a true system seller game! The atmosphere of the game, the design, the environment are so UNIQUE! Best 60$/ i have ever spend. If you have a Ps4,you have to give this game a try."
2015,Bloodborne,"i am 8 hours in and....i pity anyone who deosn't have a PS4. best f*cking game  i played in the last 6 years. the graphics,the atmosphere, the gameplay itself.....miyazaki is a god."
2015,Bloodborne,This game is unreal. If Megan Fox was a game this would be her. Hidetaka Miyazaki Is a God. If he was a greek God he would be Zeus. Infact Zeus has nothing on Hidetaka Miyazaki. F*ck Zeus! heil Hidetaka MiyazakiI love Bloodborne. But it. No excuses.
2015,Bloodborne,"Before you read my reviews, i just wanna said dat this game deserve a respect, please dont let the trolls  dat scored this 1/10 or lower fool you, cuz this game is IMHO, undoubtedly THE best game i've ever played in this next-gen gaming :). I would dare to even said dat its on par if not better than Bayonttea 2, SSB or GTA V Remastered  :D !!!I dont want to write a very long andBefore you read my reviews, i just wanna said dat this game deserve a respect, please dont let the trolls  dat scored this 1/10 or lower fool you, cuz this game is IMHO, undoubtedly THE best game i've ever played in this next-gen gaming :). I would dare to even said dat its on par if not better than Bayonttea 2, SSB or GTA V Remastered  :D !!!I dont want to write a very long and complexity review cuz i dont have time for dat, ( need to go back and shut my life with da game, know wat im sayin XD !!?? ) So i will just simply tell you the Pros & Cons:PROs:+  The best looking FROM Software game thus far! Also, Running on native 1080p 30fps.+  Story wise is not the core of the game, but its indeed well constructed.+. Very challenging, even to vetetan Demon/Dark-Soul players cuz the game mechanic is faster and more aggressive than previous titles. If you play passively like you did in DS, then you are gonna get rekt-ed.+  The soundtracks. Played and you will understand of how beautiful it real'y is  ;).+  Chalice Dungeon, an online mode  dat is unique to Demon Souls, Dark Souls. It will give you re-playable value sky rocketed, I guarantee!+  Combats & Weaponry are excellent!  Unlike dark souls 2 where we have tons of weapons but most of them are pretty much useless at some point  and have no real identity in it. Bloodborne is opposite to dat, its chose the Path of Quality over Quantity. Since each weapon will give you different moves, different builds, different effects, powers, buffs, etc. Every single weapon is important & Unique, It is very diversity in its own way.+  Boss fights. If you think Dark Souls 2 boss fight was great ? Think again cuz Bloodborne just delivered this awesomeness to a whole new scale, its much more scarier, its much more graphically improvement and its indeed way more HARDER. (especially those in Chalice Dungeon.)Now is the sad part about the game, the Cons....CONs:- Framerate would drop at around 24-26 fps when you are in boss fight, very rare tho.- buggy & loading screen, i have only met twice so far, but it is indeed in the game.However, since these cons are very unessential and a little buggy with a framerate drops can be found in any game you can list of, not to mention i played the game BEFORE the launch XD!. Im sure when the game released, then It will be perfect :).Happy gaming everybody and please stop trolling, thx :).\"
2015,Bloodborne,I was very surprised with the game is really showing the true potential of the PS4. Remember that we are only at the beginning of generation console. Many good things still to come. Congratulations SONY for this great release. Note 10.
2015,Bloodborne,"This is a phenomenal game. Its visuals far surpass any of the souls games, as well as the gameplay. Rather than hiding behind a shield for hours on end, the combat is extremely fast-paced and dynamic. The atmosphere throughout the game says consistent even through various sceneries. Its an absolute must-buy for every ps4 owner."
2015,Bloodborne,First time playing a From Software game. I have to say this game is freaking amazing! Once I'm done with this which I'm sure it will not be for a while I'm gonna give the Dark Souls games a shot. I just love that feeling of accomplishment with this very difficult but addicting game.
2015,Bloodborne,"Game Of the Year already!?!? I cannot stress this enough, if you do not play Bloodborne you are missing history not in the making but already made. Please find an excuse/ lie/legit reason/ to have your love ones get you this game now if you can't afford it. To the gamers with 60$ we already have it and if you don't put frozen thin sliced bologna in your PS4 and play that."

I pre ordered this game weeks in advance because I am a if fan of the fallout series. I enjoyed Fallout 3 and yes even New Vegas.  I couldn't wait to sit down for hours and tell everyone how good this game is...alas it isn't so.The graphics for one are mediocre at best with game such as witcher 3 and assassins creed pushing the envelope. There is no excuse for this at all. Honestly it's comparable to the graphics in Fallout 3The story, I know how could they screw this part up. This is what I was like looking forward to the most.  They were very lazy in putting the story together. There is no back story or time to get in to the character which is a staple with fallout games.  The reviewers say they throw you in to the story.  I say they were lazy plain and simple.  The result is I don't care about the character or his journey.The gameplay smh. It just isn't fun.  There is no yes moment when you kill your last enemy or go through the dialogue which is all bad.  The main character sounds like he is one word away from going straight to sleep.In the end I am very disappointed.  Bethesda had enough time to knock this out the park but gave us something that feels unfinished . I read through the positive reviews no and I understand people want to like this game honestly I get that. As gamers though we can't settle for mediocrity lets reward companies who push the envelope and berate those who give us slop.  This is the first game I ever preordered and I'm honestly amazed at how mediocre it is.  I would rent it first if you like it then buy.  Shame on Bethesda though for releasing this knowing it was half crap.\"

HOW?!?!The story is not really interesting neither but that didn't catch me as a surprise to be honest (Haven't finished it yet though, I have played it like 24 hours or so). The problem is that not only I have to deal with the mostly dumb dialogues this game offers, I also have to suffer the worst voice acting I have heard on a huge triple A game. Spanish voice actors I mean, don't know how the English voice acting is for the game, but I wish I could, because guess what, I CAN'T CHANGE THE F***ING LANGUAGE OF THE GAME!! WHYYY!!!And the decisions you make on the game are:Option 1: YESOption 2: NO^ That's exactly the kind of decisions you are going to find on this game. Awesome right?...It took me quite some time to get used to the controls of the game because they are not what you would consider good...I'm not going to play the game right now any longer, I'm going to wait for some patches because the game needs them. So right now I give the game a 4, when they release some patches maybe it will go up to a 6 or even more. I hope so...So this is not a review since I haven't finished it yet, just my impressions.\"

Instead I've downloaded the new DLC for Witcher 3.I would try and say to those ho are massive Bethesda, Skyrim, Fallout 3 fans to try it out, but honestly I really can't recommend it, I shouldn't. I feel really let down and we're all pretty much just contributing to our own disappointment. They know we'll just buy these games no matter what.I wouldn't be surprised if in 4-5 years they try to sell us a new elder scrolls in the form of a mod kit for 50 and just continue to laugh as the money pours in :(\"

2015,Fallout 4,"Ehhhhhh. Disappointed is an under-statement, thanks a lot Last of Us.I know it's not the same game, the RPG feature being the major factor in why people buy the majority of Bethesda games. But with the setting being quite similar it makes it very difficult for me not to compare the two (especially after playing in 3rd person mode).

Disappointed is an under-statement, thanks a lot Last of Us.I know it's not the same game, the RPG feature being the major factor in why people buy the majority of Bethesda games. But with the setting being quite similar it makes it very difficult for me not to compare the two (especially after playing in 3rd person mode). The game doesn't feel like it's progressed enough since Fallout 3, certainly not enough for 7 years and on a new generation of consoles. The frame-rate consistently drops way below its capped 30fps, very frustrating bugs when playing and a broken autosave function that basically just doesn't.. save.. After about 4 hours straight gameplay, and after numerous ""autosaves"" I died. This returned me way back, literally missions back. I had trophies for missions I completed, then had to complete the missions again. After re-doing the missions, I found the only way to do it is to manual save, which can be quite frustrating as it's so easy to forget in 2015.Remembering when The Last of Us was released on Playstation 3, visually it was better than this is, the gameplay was a hell of a lot smoother and although it did have bugs they weren't game-changing, the gameplay was good enough to forgive and so was the story. For this being a story-oriented game, I expected a lot better after eagerly awaiting it since its announcements' teasing announcement. The last of Us, for me personally, has really set the bar for the whole post-apocalyptic theme and this game falls way, way short of it in any way.Despite this, the game is still playable to an extent and would hope that the game isn't so bug-filled and disappointing for others. I have full faith that Bethesda will patch the problems sooner rather than later, they really won't want to lose any more reputation on a big game leading up to Christmas. But until these fixes are popped-up in the top left corner of my screen with a v1.02 update, my copy is staying in the shelf.And people, I know it's bad right now, but giving it 0/10 implies it's one of the worst games ever made. We all know that award is a fight between the annual murder of the COD and FIFA franchises.\"

I never played fallout 1 or 2. I however, fell in love with the game based off fallout 3 AND fallout new vegas. All the create your own path elements are completely removed from the game. As with many other games, when you ""simplify"" and ""streamline"" games that were already wildly popular, you are basically dumbing it down to the lowest common denominator, and ignoring the fact the game was wildly popular before without having done so. What once was a great game is ruined. The fact you could kill almost anyone was a reflection of the make any choice feel to the game. Now, 90% of NPCs are invincible, but are able to remember your bad actions and kill you even after you have respawned from the fact they just killed you. No weapons are armor degradation. Boring repetitive dialogue wheel. I would rather have kept no voice for more depth of dialogue choices, outcomes, consequences, and funny responses. You could be whoever you wanted in the game, but of course with consequences. Now, besides your looks, every character is the same bland character at heart. Yes the previous fallout had general endings, but at least they were ranged based on what you've done and the kind of person you had been throughout the game. The things that made the game an enjoyable challenging, like actually have consequences and rewards to having certain special attributes, skills and perks, to weapons and armor degradation, to having to or choosing to alter your playstyle to fit your characters unique skill set and personality, was what made the game so immersive and made you feel as if you were a part of the game, telling your own story. I find the biggest irony to be that the game is rated mature but gutted out, dumbed down and simplified enough so that small children can follow along. The thrill of finally getting your hands on power armor midway or late in the game is quickly replaced by a deflated instant gratification of being in armor 20 minutes into the game. Yes the FPS elements are improved, the settlement idea is cool if that's your thing, and it makes the massive amount of random items more useful, but it also makes them potentially more annoying and tedious to collect. I could care less about the graphics, and even some of the bugs, if the story, choice and gameplay elements were as great as before. Bethesda failed to realize that the very same thing that allowed them to get away with what has turned out to be a massive hype train cash grab is exactly what they have abandoned. The overpriced McDonalds happy meal quality pip boy that needs a phone to work with the game, otherwise its a cheap fragile prop. The t shirts, the figurines, the collectors edition vault dwellers guide,  etc., etc., etc. this game was so commercialized from the beginning I should have seen the quality coming. No I have nothing against Bethesda, well at least not up until now. I never played and elder scolls, skyrim, or mass effect. But apparently this is a common theme from understandably pissed repeat victims of Bethesda. As much as the COD sheep crowd and professional critic crowd want to dismiss us as unpleasable, stuck in the past ""metacritic troll"" curmudgeons, this game is a siginificant downgrade to the series. I also find the critique of saying its a remastered  fallout 3 or a fallout 3 dlc to be too kind. Fallout 3 and IMO especially Fallout New Vegas, are superior in every way to fallout 4. The only way I will ever consider buying another fallout is if obsidian is put in charge of development again. Wasted money on a watered down disappointment, that sacrificed the awesome intricacies for superficial ""mass appeal upgrades"" like a voiced character and improved FPS elements. Sadly and ironically the game already had mass appeal without these horrid ""tradeoffs"" and now in my opinion, never will have the same hype. Franchises always do this. Ditch what made you an awesome game in order to have more mass appeal, but in the end never realizing that what you chose to ditch is exactly what gave you mass appeal. People don't buy franchise games because of how much they are exactly like other franchise games. They buy franchise games because they are their own unique game, yet they are similar to other games in the franchise, but with improvements, without detracting from or sacrificing old elements that made the game a thrill in the first place. If I want to see COD elements in every game, I will keep playing COD. If I want to see GTA in every game, I will keep playing GTA. If I want to see fallout elements in every game, well I guess I cant play FO4, I need to go back to new vegas or FO3. People don't buy different games to keep playing the same generic game with different studios and names plastered on front of the game. I thought I was buying fallout 4, not fallout of duty black ops. GOTY? no, more like disappointment of the year.\"
2015,Fallout 4,"A quick summary for any of you page scrollers: If you're a fan of fallout (particularly NV), you're going to be majorly disappointed. If you're someone whos a big RPG fan, you're going to be disappointed.

Sure the new leveling system might hurt a bit at first, but it's a good attempt to balance the incredibly broken skill system (I mean does anybody miss Survival, really?). Crafting system means instead of going to a vendor, you will scrap useless weapons of your enemies and modify your own. Radiation matters and it matters much. But well, that's it for the advantages of this game.Main issue of this game? You go to the nearest location of your vault and hear shooting raiders. Not thinking much you go shooting them, a obvious quest-giver hero figure shows and thanks you because you had a choice to go away. Oh, really? My only real choice there was to start a mission or not start a mission. I couldn't shoot him in the face, I couldn't just tell them to run away with me to the sanctuary, since I wanted to make a pacifist run. No the only real choice I had was to mow down Raiders with a minigun in a power suit, or go away. I couldn't even make a choice about how my character would behave. It was mostly yes, no, question and sarcastic, which half of the time is playful, half is annoyed. Which brings us to another great issue: lack of character creation. Sure I could sculpt faces of both of them however I wanted, but it was still a person capable of having a family. No psychopaths, no antisocial nerds. Wonder how he got such a good wife with one point of charisma. Part of what makes Bethesda recipe games good is how we forget about main quest while exploring surroundings, each having it's own story. No such thing in Fallout 4. You will constantly remind everybody (and game will for you) that you have a son you don't care about to rescue. The settlement mechanic is slapped on the game and provides you no reason to use it. Do you really care about some unnamed settlers who provide no reason to fight for them, only demanding really useful and rare resources like military grade circuit board, for some radiated fruits?Game isn't even immersive, does not make you care about what goes on the screen, only to push your armor to protect you against more damage. No illusion of autonomy, you either go a one specific way designers expect you to, or you don't go at all. It's worst sin is that unlike Skyrim, which had many similar problems, it's also unengaging of all things.\"

I truly enjoy games where I can create my own character, which is why I was looking forward to this game.  Even reserved it.  Unfortunately, the story is bad.  Why am I fighting to save people 30 minutes after leaving the vault if I am supposed to be looking for my baby?  Why should I risk my life for these people with guns, which jeopardizes my main goal?  Also, I am encountering game bugs.  For example, I like to play with subtitles on so I don't miss any of the dialogue.  At times, a subtitle already spoken will remain on screen after being spoken, while the audio voice of the characters continues on.  The only way to correct it was go into the options, turn subtitles off, go back to the game, than back to options to turn them back on.  Very frustrating.  The hit detection on enemies while aiming down the sites is terrible.  Very often, buy aim site will be right on the enemy, but the shot doesn't hit.  Frankly, a game like Saints Row has more depth and a better story, which is kind of sad.  At least in that game, the story progresses logically toward my end goal.  I only gave it a 3 because I liked the in game music, and being able to create a neat character of my own.  Will be selling/trading In right away before the price goes down.\"
2015,Fallout 4,"Overall I am somewhat disappointed in this game. There are many glaringly blatant issues that prevent it from being what they claim it is. First off the new conversation system is dumb. In every conversation you are given the same 4 options, yes, no, I dont know, or f--- you. Thats not choosing my destiny thats the same 4 cruddy choices over and over again. This really is a problem in the main story because no matter what you choose the game wont pick what side you are on until a big pop up box opens up and says ""if you go here you will be against so and so"" so the dialogue you chose has no importance whatsoever on the game outcome. Furthermore the story is BAD. It copies many elements directly from the old games. They jammed in liberty prime randomly to make a connection to fallout 3. The also randomly jammed in Dr Madison Li from fallout 3 and your character randomly starts asking about her and the brother hood oh steel guy knows your interested in her for some reason when you should not know her at all. Another problem with the story is the main saying ""war never changes"". After hearing it 50 times it gets really old. You cant start every game with it and end every game with it. It doesn't fit. At the end of the game there is no war so its randomly jammed in. In general the story and characters have no depth. As other people say the FPS dips under 30 at many points and the graphics are about the fallout 3-new vegas level. Also as many people have said there are MANY game breaking bugs. Some of them break the main story. One example is if your sided with the brotherhood and kill your son and all the people in the institute. Then not only is the institute still alive even if you kill all the people, but then when you teleport back the quest line picks up with the minutemen for no reason. Also there are even spelling issues in the dialogue, randomly floating objects, the fact you cant speak to 95% of people in the game like you used to be able to(they just say a generic statement and walk away). The fact that I have beaten the main campaign and there is only 1 real town compared to NV and FO3 that had plenty of settlements. The fact there is really only 1 radio station with a announcer that sucks. The fact that there are only like 10 radio songs and like 7 of them are from the old games. The fact the companions are awful and always get in the way(especially the dog in the beginning). The fact that you get power armor from day 1 and its not treated as a normal item so you always have to get in and out of power armor to do anything.  This game overall feels rushed, lacking, and not improved upon. The new VATS system is pure junk. Third person is bad in normal use, but since the new weapon sighs are so bad I find myself switching to third person in combat just to get the dot in the center of the screen to aim at so I can see what I am shooting(never used to be a problem). They directly took the fallout 3 give the people water scenario and turned it into give us power instead. 90% of the story is very predictable, and there are many important topics that never get addressed again. For one thing everyone complains how the institute takes people, kills people, and replaces them with synths. Then you get into the institute and they are peaceful and it is never mentioned again. The three main factions that duke it out (brotherhood railroad and institute) all have very short cited goals that are BAD. You either pick to go with the railroad who wants to kill the brotherhood of steel and the institute because they want to save ALL synths above peoples live (STUPID), the brotherhood of steel who wants to kill ALL synths an they want to kill the railroad and institute just because they dont trust anyone (STUPID), or the institute who want to kill the others just because they could be threatened  (STUPID).  Another problem is how the SPECIAL system is different and they dont tell you it changed before they make you stick with it. I put all my points into intelligence thinking I was going to be able to raise my skills fast like in the old games. Big mistake. Furthermore the new settlement crafting system is pure JUNK also. Its like minecraft randomly jammed into fallout. It doesn't fit and the game engine doesn't seem designed for it. The main story easily breaks because of it. In one part of the main story when you have to construct  the teleporter using the crafting system if you dont have everything lined up right you cant continue the story. Plus the game literally has to make you build all the stuff on the same electrical grid in  a weird way BECAUSE BETHESDA DIDN'T FIX THE BUGS. They literally have a charactuer that says ""build all the stuff on the same power grid becuase we didn't know how to code this part into the game right"" well thats pretty much what they said :P . Overall dissapointing but it still did offer many hours of fun. I hope bethesda gives me my moneys worth from the season pass. bug fix to come?\"

Mediocre is the word that keeps popping into my head as I walk around the wasteland and shoot stuff while listening to 50s music.It's a generally clunky game, while the AI of both enemies and companions is a joke. ""Hey we got some cover right there, but let's not use it and instead run straight at the enemy that just has mowed down my four buddies!"" The story is weak, the characters one-dimensional and the dialogues are down right cringeworthy. And the whole conversation wheel is just dumb. The graphics are improved from previous Bethesda titles, but is still several years behind even when you take into the account the large environments. Witcher 3 has vastly superior graphics, for instance.The gun play is better than FO 3, but still clunky and uninspiring and still not on the level of your average first/third person shooter. The whole construction bit just feels pasted on and not really part of the game. The fact that all the game-play mechanics that New Vegas added and improved over FO3 have been removed, is just stupid. No one forced you to play hardcore mode in FNV, but the option was there for those who wished it.The world is basically the game's strongest aspect, and it ranges from somewhat interesting to dull. Many locations are nothing but enemy spawn-points with loot. Sometimes there is some sort of story or background attached to a location, but often it just feels like a waste of time to explore them. I like many of the power armor mechanics in the game, but Bethesda made the armor itself so easy to get and so prevalent in the world, that it didn't feel like anything special in the end.So all in all, I'm not at all impressed. I regret my purchase.\"

Being a Philosophy major, I'll help people understand the problems here. Fallout 4 is not a good game because it was created not with the content or art of the game in mind but the money. There is evidence to show, and in fact business/accounting majors are taught this phenomenon that happens globally, that when money becomes a reward for doing an action, intellectual involvement decreases as well as detail oriented work and consideration decreases. This corresponds to the game in that this was an anticipated blockbuster hit. Because the money came first probably since the marketing team oversees many projects within a company, the game lost what would have made it a ""True"" fallout game like that of New Vegas and 3. Intuitively, this is easy to see from the marketer's perspective, ""Do I pay this story writer three times more than I do now for a good story in this game and get payed less or do I just make sure the bells and whistles work long enough to make more money and cut out a story?"" Simple answer, the marketer is taught how to make money. Don't expect a mathematician to work with artists about how to make art theory more rigorous. Don't expect a theologian to try to give arguments against the existence of God. Don't expect the marketer to worry about the aesthetic value of Fallout 4 in dealing with choice, determinism, literature, story, and experience. He worries about cash. Extend this to other games. Call of Duty franchise after CoD4, League of Legends with not well thought-out champions, World of Warcraft after Wrath of Lich King with bland armor designs, dumbed down lore, etc... Bethesda will learn that people didn't come to see cheap county art fair drawings. We came to see the next piece of art that guides the gaming community and creators. Money is easily forgotten, but destruction of reputation is a deep scar. Let this be a lesson for any company that thinks a marketer can do better than a chef, musician, programmer, engineer, scientist, painter, mathematician, or a philosopher. Leave those arts to their masters, not a person looking to make a profit off of it.Sincerely,A gamer.\"

2015,Fallout 4,"A quick summary for any of you page scrollers: If you're a fan of fallout (particularly NV), you're going to be majorly disappointed. If you're someone whos a big RPG fan, you're going to be disappointed. If you're neither of those you might have a good time with the game but if you do i strongly advise you whip out the last gen systems and play FO3/NV (Especially NV).Now for a more inA quick summary for any of you page scrollers: If you're a fan of fallout (particularly NV), you're going to be majorly disappointed. If you're someone whos a big RPG fan, you're going to be disappointed. If you're neither of those you might have a good time with the game but if you do i strongly advise you whip out the last gen systems and play FO3/NV (Especially NV).Now for a more in depth look at this game. First of im going to list what was improved upon, because though the game is bad i feel like for this to be a fair review these FEW things have to be acknowledge.1. The gun play is the improvement every Fallout player was hoping for. Its still not a perfect system, but its leaps and bounds from the last iterations of the franchise.2. The character creation is pretty fantastic, though the graphics dont allow this to shine as much as a graphically more impressive game would.3. The settlement feature is fun and adds quite a bit whilst being completely optional.4. Voice acting is much improved in terms of voice variations. Some of it still sounds poorly read.5. Animations all round are better (but again, not perfect or anywhere near) which leads to more interesting fights, different enemies have much more varied attacks than before.Those are what i believe to be the improvements. Now the important stuff. What did Bethesda do to absolutely ruin this game. Here goes:1. Dialog wheel, dialog wheel, dialog wheel. When. Will. RPG Devs. Learn. I dont understand how this idea got past in a meeting. There have been numerous RPG's which have implemented this along with voice acting from a more traditional system and precisely ZERO have gotten better because of it. Did no one learn from the travesty which is now the Dragon age series? It limits what you are able to say/ask. You get limited information on what you're going to say which can lead to ridiculous encounters where you're blurting out stuff that is completely different to what you thought. And to implement it into a game the WHOLE dialog system has to be dumbed down, no skill related conversation options - what replaced it is pitiful and not fit for purpose.2. The environment is very boring from my experience. The major city in this game is ludicrously small and the map is not much better. There are a lot of side quests and encounters but im talking just the general environment, it all looks very similar and dull to the eye. Boston is the weakest setting so far.3. You dont appear to have much of an impact on the world, much like Skyrim. This is no Witcher 3 ladies and gents, Bethesda got this completely wrong and makes major decisions seem trivial.4. A very black or white morality with no reputation system or karma. IMO a step backwards for the series as it could have been improved upon from that last games and been made into a really enjoyable and in depth mechanic. Bethesda decided to scrap it instead.5. The perks...lord, the perks are terrible. Not that what they offer is bad, or even that there isnt variety. Just that without a skill system it all seems rather empty and shallow. Again, instead of improving upon a mechanic that people liked that just scrapped it to make it simpler.6. Your companions are just as dumb as the were before if not more this time. I swear dog meat spends more time in front of me in doorways than he does following. Again, you cant switch them from ranged to melee anymore, you can change how they fight. Another mechanic which could of been improved upon and made brilliant but instead was scrapped for a simpler less satisfying and frankly annoying system.7. The story has MAJOR pacing issues. Its all over the place, gets good after a few hours in but Bethesda needs to hire some better writers because it doesnt hold up with other game of the same genre. Not even close.8. New legendary monsters. This one might be just me because what they've chosen to do is a creative choice rather than just a bad decision. But basically its like borderlands. You get random really strong monsters on side quests or when you're exploring and they drop better loot. But calling them legendary really waters down the experience of fighting them. After fighting 'legendary' mongrels that are less than two feet tall and somehow take twenty bullets on normal difficulty the system just seems really stupid and arcadey. It doesnt suit fallout at all. I hope to god they take it out i feel like im playing some god awful MMO. In other Fallouts named raiders etc would be exciting, because they're characters, and they might have a story behind them. But now they just fade into the abyss of endless slain legendary enemies who sponge bullets. It waters it down.The whole game just feels watered down. For every step forward they took two steps backward. Fallout 4 is an average game whilst being a TERRIBLE RPG and an even worse sequel. I hope these reviews get noticed by someone in Bethesda.\"

The protagonists are lack of self motivation and purpose of living, and thus not able to build/push their own story ahead but to be an object/interface that you use to access the virtual world. In other words, they are inferior, relentless and neglectable, and I feel their story are mostly stiffly padded by narrates rather than developed during the progression of the their own doing.In GTAV and Witcher3, dev put more work on depicting the mental development as the result of the surrounding events, and the story is actually progressed by the ambition and action of protagonist self. You can annotate this as that they are more susceptible/sensitive to the surrounding and have strong desire to achieve something mentally and independently. These makes a much more vivd and motivated feeling of a real human you are playing and experiencing a true life from him who want to do some amazing things to make himself unique, rather than a robot thrown into a open world to serve as a slaver.Nowadays, the in-game world is exaggerated to a distorted proportion to characterization. In the extreme form, we know its called sandbox which some devs think is the future, but no! Not only the current and near future tech is far from enough to make player self to create a memorable and wholesome character in game, also it will be a tragedy if that becomes true. We don't want an object to control but a human with story to experience.After all, Fallout 4 failed to create a protagonist who should act as an independent, self-motivated and susceptible real HUMAN and an engaging story struggled by the protagonist's own ass out. Next time, please focus on characters rather than just that open world.\"
2015,Fallout 4,"First of all, it must be said that this game is nowhere near complete on PS4. The graphics/textures are awful and the framerate frequently dips; it's crashed several times with generic error codes; and there are numerous gameplay issues:1.) There's no indication of mission difficulty ANYWHERE in the PipBoy. I just stumbled upon the Mirelurk Queen at level 13 and I can't do anything but barely scratch her with my pea shooters. Where are the indicators for mission difficulty? And I wasn't able to talk to Preston without doing this mission, so if he dies because I flee, both of my other missions that depend on him will most likely fail. I was able to talk to him, but he kept saying ""we must focus on clearing this castle."" Like he can't talk to me about other business while we clear the castle? COME ON!2.) The Ghouls can lunge literally 20-30 feet, and you can't strategically engage combat on any scuttling creature. Humanoid foes can hit you with their spraying bullets from behind cover. I have screenshots of enemies behind pipes and walls with bullets still hitting me. If you sprint, you lose your AP; every battle ends up being a straight line backward shuffle trying to keep away from enemies that can do half of your health in damage by lunging and smacking you from 20 feet away. And your dog or whomever you have with you as a companion? Yeah, HAHA, good luck! Most often my dog is down within seconds, or just standing there doing nothing as the hoards advance on me. Pointless, stupid, and awful AI.3.) The building system is completely stupid, boring, and lacks motivation. Some missions force you to do some of it, and for scavenging and breaking down components it's a necessary addition, but ultimately it's stupid.4.) AP drains way too quickly unless you waste precious SPECIAL points trying to build it up at lower levels. Everything drains AP, too, including sprinting? What the...? Melee...AP drain; spring...AP drain; which leaves almost none for VATS.5.) The idiot dog keeps standing in doorways and blocks your way in and out of combat. And when you have to trade with the meat sack to load your gear onto him, he runs off and you can't target him to get the command list!!! And speaking of the dog carrying loot, it's equally stupid and unnecessary...why not just let my character carry all of it himself??!!!??!6.) Everything upgrade on EVERY gun or armor requires freaking adhesive, which is in such rare supply that you MAYBE can do one or two upgrades for every 7 hours of picking up worthless gear that you have absolutely zero knowledge of how it pieces together, how it will work, or anything. There aren't any guides or anything in the game to steer you along the proper path. If you're not at a workbench, good luck figuring out which components are required to upgrade your stupid gun.7.) The worst offense: it's NO different than Fallout 3. Absolutely zero difference, and with the graphics and crashing problems, it's actually worse. This game has been hyped and hyped, as usual, to make a cash grab of gamers, but Bethesda should be ashamed and embarrassed to release a product this incomplete and buggy, not to mention frustrating. I realize they cater to the PC gamers and they'll fix all the problems for Bethesda, but we console owners demand better since we can't fix these problems on our machines. This game is going back and being uninstalled until such time as this garbage is fixed. I'm highly upset at spending this kind of money on a game this poor quality. And nice job with the embargo on the reviews until the day of to make sure no one else knew of this garbage in advance. Must be nice to buy space on Conan and hype up a game this embarrassingly poor. I'm sorry that I'm speaking like this, but I think it's a downright scam that companies are taking advantage of gamers over and over again. It shows you have zero respect for the people lining your pockets. Over and over again, companies aren't giving us next gen anything, it's bug-ridden, latency-ridden, framerate-stuttering, day one nonsense. Destiny and now this, this generation of gaming has nothing of its former self, just the same - or worse - garbage from the last gen with maybe a few graphical sparkles thrown in for good measure.

2015,Fallout 4,"dumbed down rpg mechanics, horrible voice acting, atrocious graphics, a story that seems like it was written by a grade-schooler, and that fps. wait for the GOTY version, at least then you'll get the full story with less bugs."
2015,Fallout 4,"This is my first review on Metacritic, I felt compelled to set up an account purely to warn people about this game.

IThis is my first review on Metacritic, I felt compelled to set up an account purely to warn people about this game. Im a long time fan of the Fallout series and I keep an open mind to most games that come out, but this instalment had me gutted after 14 - 15 hours of playing(PS4), I just was'nt bothered going any further with either the story(yawn...) or the exploring of the landscape. I was expecting Bethesda to release a wonderful game, I had never been so excited for a game release and I had been picturing how amazing it would be for a long time(Just like most of you im sure).I give this game a 1 which is a true reflection of the garbage that is Fallout 4, I am disgusted to be honest that it actually made it to the shelves in the state it's in and feel like an idiot for buying it outright thinking it would be the best game ever made. This is the last time I buy a game from Bethesda, also the last time I pre-order a game, I have finally learned from my mistakes in recent years. Ok so ill try keep it brief:- Graphics are a joke, they look similar to games I played on 360 and PS3. I dunno about you guys but I was expecting much much better than this. Some of the textures are laughable and borderline offensive by today's standards. The NPC's and most of the characters are also lifeless in appearance and the guns dont look great either despite the hype about crafting/customising, they all look like scrap metal in the end. This game looks like it was made back in 2008 or 2009, so outdated in appearance.- Gameplay is pretty annoying and sluggish, I grew so frustrated with the shooting it just feels strange. I dont think I enjoyed a single exchange in the whole game, the fights were so boring and there are huge fps issues when the larger gun fights break out. Dont even get me started on perks and the protagonist, no matter what you choose/say it all feels and sounds the same there is a glaring lack of effort put into this part of the game. That stupid dog annoyed me greatly as well and the new V.A.T.S was also meh...-  Performance is really poor, as I mentioned above fps issues a plenty and I encountered enough bugs to piss me off enough to give up on Fallout 4. Some of the bugs had me incensed, where you will be forced to reload an earlier save which can mean you need to repeat various tasks/missions all over again. Such a mess I recommend manually saving if you somehow like this game and want to play it furtherIts a broken game, its lacking creativity on all fronts and the AI will drive you insane at times. The entire game is lazy and poorly made, its not functioning properly on all platforms from what ive read and in my eyes it is a colossal failure. All the mods in the world wont fix this sorry excuse of a game, save your time and money if you haven't already made the same mistake I did.There are multiple PS4 titles out there which are far more deserving such as Dying Light, Bloodborne, Borderlands, Uncharted Collection and Last of Us to name a few, all of which I found very enjoyable but hey that's just me we all have our preferences. I cant really put into words how I feel about Fallout 4, its not what I thought it would be but I didn't expect it to be this bad. Literally no positives to mention, except the bobble-head figure I got for picking it up at midnight which looks cool.Yours sincerely,A heartbroken gamer :(I\"
2015,Fallout 4,"One of the biggest disappointments in gaming I've seen in a while. There are so many simple mechanics that were senselessly sabotaged for the sake of streamlining the experience, and ironically, the game fails to do so most of the time. When the game does manage to streamline the experience, it ends up dumbing the mechanics down to the point where they aren't fun anymore.First; theOne of the biggest disappointments in gaming I've seen in a while. There are so many simple mechanics that were senselessly sabotaged for the sake of streamlining the experience, and ironically, the game fails to do so most of the time. When the game does manage to streamline the experience, it ends up dumbing the mechanics down to the point where they aren't fun anymore.First; the good. The gun-play is improved from previous games. The enemies are very fast and aggressive and the guns don't have perfect accuracy, which is a great incentive to use VATS despite the weapon handling being vastly improved. The character creator is also fantastic. You have a solid amount of control and sculpting the face rather than using sliders was very inspired and makes creating a character a blast, although, I feel like it's hard to make any face that deviates too much from the default model you have; despite this, it's still a great addition to the game. The settlement building gives purpose to picking up junk, and it can be interesting to see some of the most useless items end up having a legitimate use later on. The way radiation chips down your max health was another great subtle touch, making radiation a legitimate concern unlike Fallout 3.Now the bad. The opening of the game sets the tone for the rest of the game as far as story-telling goes. It's rushed, it lacks personality, it's generic, shallow, and it fails to establish even the smallest emotional connection to any of the characters or the universe. For whatever reason, we're supposed to care about this ensemble of characters despite knowing nothing about their backstories or personalities. These aren't characters, they're character models spouting out exposition. Once tragedy strikes and your main character gets out of the vault he seems remarkably unaffected by what has happened. When you explain you're over 200 years old, the other characters are also unaffected. The dialogue is simply there to progress the bare bones plot and lacks any personality or character. I couldn't tell you anything about the main cast of characters aside from the fact that they send me on incredibly basic ""clear the area"" and ""pick up the item"" quests. I have a massive excess of caps already, and I have nothing to spend them on. The settlement mechanic would be good, but assigning members to certain tasks is beyond un-intuitive and is a complete hassle. Rather than having a list of members in the settlement and a list of things to assign them to you have to walk up to one and walk back to what needs assigning. This would be monotonous if the settlements were small, but they generally aren't, making them beyond monotonous. The first buddy you come across, meatdog, is a stimpack guzzling moron that runs into combat only to immediately get knocked down. The friendly AI is way too aggressive, and they rarely ever follow the limited commands you can give properly. The way charisma works is awful. IT's not intuitive, it makes no sense gameplay wise or logically in the context of the universe, and it is very obviously inferior to what was previously in place. The new dialogue wheel is bad, but it suits the writing well since all of your responses are very generic yes or no replies or cringe worthy jokes/sarcasm. Rather than having your character be a blank slate for you to *role play* as, you play a set character, and he/she couldn't be more boring if he/she tried. So much emphasis was put on humanizing your character, with fully acted dialogue and an attempted personal story, only to provide one of the most boring/shallow experiences I've had in a long time. To say this voice acting wasn't utilized well would be an understatement. If anything, there's more of a reason for the dialogue to just be text in this game considering how boring all of your responses are. As for the technical side, this game is loaded to the brim with bugs which is absolutely unacceptable. Warping around rooms for no reason, grenade indicators pointing the opposite way, enemies shooting into the sky after being hit, bad AI, bad graphics, you name some sort of technical issue and this game has it; It's a buggy mess. It seems animations are missing as well, such as an animation for holstering your gun.I don't like throwing this word around, but I honestly think Fallout 4 is simply unfinished. There are mechanics that make no sense, it's way too dumbed down, and there's no way any QA department approved of the game in this current state; the graphics are bad, the animations are stiff, the gameplay is boring, the writing is mediocre at best, and the world is not interesting. Fallout 4 is the most disappointing game I've played in a very long time, but at least Bethesda made it very clear to me very quickly that i shouldn't buy their games anymore; rather than giving this game any redeeming value and making me stick around for the next one, I know to just give up now before wasting any more of my time or money.\"

One should expect bugs for a new release but I can't escape thinking that Bethesda just threw this together and released it now because they want to score a mountain of cash from the holidays. They didn't even try to offer a clean release. A few minor bugs would be tolerable but there are massive bugs in this game that prevent me from progressing in this game, really, really massive hindrances. What's even more infuriating, after having done searches about some of the bugs that are preventing me from progressing are being widely report by players on every platform - PS4, Xbox, PC - and yet Bethesda has said nothing to anyone about preparing a fix. We're getting crickets. I really feel cheated having thrown down $60 for this POS. This just may be the last time I throw any money Bethesda's way. Fool me once, shame on me. Fool me twice...

The dialogue system is just pure garbage. I don't see any point in RPG style charisma play through what-so-ever, which is something I did in all previous Fallouts.The S.P.E.C.I.A.L. is also dumbed down to a point where your choices don't even matter. You can just upgrade your base stats at level-up, so your initial ""character"" does not affect your play style at all. Not that it would anyway, because I don't see any effect of the stats on the game play apart from being able to carry more ****The story so far, well, it's the same beginning as in every other Fallout really. However, the story progression and the NPC's you meet are extremely one dimensional and I actually feel like murdering them all rather than having to suffer through the painfully uninspiring dialogues.I personally do not care for the graphics that much, which seems to be a major gripe for a lot of people, but this game is just not up to par in next gen gaming. What's worse is that it is actually VERY difficult to spot enemies without using VATS due to the ""improved"" graphics, particularly when compared to New Vegas.At launch, it is filled with bugs and **** The framerate is at times abysmal. The character gets stuck on invisible obstacles, and so forth. If it wasn't a Fallout game, I would have quite playing after the first 4 hours.Final word:Am I going to finish the game? Abso-fcking-lutely.Am I going to replay it? No.Is this the GOTY? NO!(Hopefully there will be patches lined up pretty soon or the broken game play and engine might force me to put this on the shelf until I'm tired of SW:BW)\"

But this is exactly the problem. This happens every time a game gets over hyped by dumb wannabe-fans.Everything was dumbed down from past Fallout games, hell, even Fallout 3 (which was pretty dumb) had better RPG elements. If you're a fan of the real Fallout games, you will hate this. If you are a fan of the RPG genre, you will despise this.Not only the RPG elements were dumbed down, but a lot of the aspects of difficulty, like the lifespan of your weapons. Bethesda excels in taking the Fallout franchise, where Fallout 1 and Fallout 2 were considered some of the greatest, greatest RPG games ever made, and turn it into a generic shooter.Then we start with the dumb stuff (no spoilers):-Dialog wheel. Who the hell thought this was a good idea? The dialog wheel's only purpose is to kill the immersion with the character and also to dumb down your character's dialog.-Voiced main character: Sucks because of the same reasons as dialog wheel. Zero immersion with your character. Imagine a voiced Gordon Freeman.-Combat: Even though it is not bad at all to have shooting elements in a Fallout game, Fallout 4 forces those elements in. 20 minutes into the game and you get yourself involved in a scripted shooting mission, then you unlock the power armor, get back in the scripted scene with a scripted Deathclaw.-Difficulty: You can change the difficulty at any given time (very stupid for any video game).  Also power armor at 20 minutes into the game. Also immortal dogmeat.-Writing: It is known by everyone that Bethesda sucks at writing a coherent story and or dialogs.-Writing: Remember the multiple story lines, nonlinear main story and freedom of story flow, faction cooperation and all that sweet stuff from Fallout 1, Fallout 2 and New Vegas? Well, all that stuff is gone.-More writing: Remember the gray moral system of New Vegas? Well, welcome back again to Fallout 3's black or white moral system.-More writing (ending) (no spoilers): Bethesda can't come up with an original story, so they had to rip it off the original Fallout 3 Van Buuren. Only dumbing it down to choosing either A or B. Way to go guys.Not to mention the frame rate drops and ugly graphics.The game is just plain bad. Bethesda managed to ruin every single improvement Obsidian made on New Vegas. It's a shame honestly. The real fans can only hope that some day Bethesda green lights Obsidian to make another Fallout game. If that never happens, then we can agree that Fallout is dead.\"

This is also the game that is making me break my personal rule about ranting on the internet.Lets start with the good shall we?- Fully Voiced Protagonist. I actually like this one, it upsets me a little because it limits modders, but for the most part having a fully voiced protagonist is pretty rad. I just wish Ron Perlman had done it all.-Walking away from conversations. Bethesda get a gold star for this.-Crafting, it serves a purpose, and it has lead me to some pretty entertaining self-made scavenger hunts.-Gunplay. It's a lot better than it used to be. Still not quite at the level of other games, but it's fun and continues to be fun. Can't ask for more than that. Weapon sounds do kinda suck though, combat lack impact because of this.-VATS. It's fun, it's useful to have, it isn't overpowered. This is a big improvement, I wouldn't change VATS at all, even the critical meter is good, it adds tension, I save it up for bosses, and then build it back up by shooting their minions while dodging said bosses. It's good.-Settlement Building. It's fun, i'm going to mention it again on the bad side, but hell, at least it's there, and reasonably good.-Companions. They are now actually likeable, even loveable. I swear these looks and personalities came out of a waifu generator. Good job.-Pretty graphics. I'm not in the crowd of people that desires ultimate fidelity everything. I like the graphics, they fit well with the world.-Power armour. Going to mention this on the bad side too, it feels powerful, the upgrading is awesome.There are other good things about this game, but I'm getting mindful of the letter limit.The bad things it is then.-No skills. I can't imagine how this decision got made. Agonising over skillpoints and character builds is a Fallout staple. Heck, it's an RPG staple.-Perk Variety. There aren't enough of these. The multiple ranks thing is good, the SPECIAL requirements are good. There just need to be more.-Upgrading SPECIAL. This is wrong, it stops me from agonising over character builds. SPECIAL upgrades need to be bobblehead, or one time perk only.-No level cap. This magnifies all the problems with no skills, perk variety and SPECIAL upgrades. It is impossible to care about character builds when any character can level up to be an everyman, expert at everything. It also hurts replayability, I have so many characters in other Fallout games. With good reason.-AI. It's still Bethesda, the AI is still dumb. I was expecting this, and to be honest I'm not that mad about it. Enemies still either shoot from cover, or run straight at you. Pathfinding in an open world game is still hard to do, and therefore still sucks. Companions still get in the way all the time. I'm not asking for the world here, just some variety in enemy strategies. Read a basic text on squad level combat strategy, then implement some basic manoeuvres.-Variety. Yep, variety as a whole. It's a colourful game now, but still too brown. I'm not finding the weird weirdness that I expect from a fallout game.-Legendary Enemies. I don't like this, I don't like this at all, especially when it suddenly applies to nuisance enemies, like dogs. Named enemies with their own little forts and dungeons are the way to go.-Settlement building. The UI is awful. The size limit is massively disappointing, it is very poorly tutorialised.-Fusion Cores. They drain too quickly, even with perks. I like to play these games without fast travel, with these fusion cores, I'm forced to choose between playing the game the way I want to, or Power Armour. I like that they exist, I just wish they lasted like, a lot longer. Ingame days, when you consider their current rarity.I think the better way would be to power the armour off of MF cells, 10 MF cells for one current size length of time. Need to playtest that when I get my PC.-Too much killing. Every quest in this game seems to be about killing things, either for it's own sake, or as an obstacle to fetching something. We need more variety than this, perhaps even a different approach. Like talking. Give diplomacy a chance.-Conversation wheel. This does not work, it has never worked in any game that wasn't Mass Effect. Every time my character says something I didn't intend, I hate him more. That's not what should be happening here.-Challenge. The only challenge is to be found in fighting, where are the epic non-quested scavenger hunts, cerebral puzzles, and other interesting pursuits that add flavour to a fallout game. I want to spent hours researching the location of a technical macguffin, working it all out myself, and going to get it.If it wasn't a Fallout game, I'd give this thing a nice solid 7, but it is a Fallout game.

2015,Fallout 4,"Quite disappointing game. Pre-ordered the game well before launch and was waiting for release date.The graphics is okay in best case but rather ugly. In some scenes ever lagging.The quests are boring and dialogs are rather stupid. Mostly Yes, No.SPECIAL skill tree is pretty worthless.Will finish the story mode quickly and resell the game while still worth anything."
2015,Fallout 4,"Very disappointed by this game. I was going to give it a 4, but after seeing the volume of 10's, I had to give it a 0 to balance things out. This is no way a 10/10 game. Drops frame rates like crazy. I couldn't order my dog around - it glitched out bad, treating all my dog commands as commands to Codsworth, and vice versa. To get the dog to do something I had to order the robot. Go figure.Very disappointed by this game.

Enemies shoot at you through walls, even though they shouldn't be able to see you. Quest dialogue is poor, mostly useless. Trading and inventory management is tiresome, tedious, and not fun at all. Most of the quests are boring. First person shooting is, honestly, the worst I've ever played. The UI is horrendous. The only good thing about this is the music. Fortunately, you don't need the game for that. I highly recommend avoiding this altogether.\"

2015,Fallout 4,"Fallout 4 with upscaled textures, same resolution. Graphically it's a shame, it does not look like a current-gen game. It looks like someone ripped Skyrim and upscaled the textures a bit. Almost no shadows anywhere and framerates routinely drop below 20 FPS in heated battles.Gameplay, it's more Fallout 3 with building mechanics. Nothing really new to the table."

2015,Fallout 4,"To put it simply. This game is huge step backwards for the fallout series nothing added bar the crafting is an improvement. The dialogue, skills and perks overhaul was a huge mistake and honestly makes the game inferior in most ways to 3 and NV.

The story development was very well done, but that may be the only enjoyable thing in this game for me. The controls while aiming were slow and took some getting use to. The inability to use a weapon of my choice was annoying because ammo is virtually non existent. The companions seem to be a very dumb A.I. My next issue was the graphics and game play. Often time I felt the game was cheap looking and objects often disappeared or had jagged lines. My character often got stuck on objects, but that was the worst part. Very often I saw fps issues where the game went into a seizure and a few times even crashed the game making me restart from a distant save.The side quests and fort building feel like simple time padding to me, that had no real benefit to the game.Now the story -First it started strong, but depending on your choices, you may not be able to continue or trophy hunt after the end missions.The game felt short to me. Sure the game has tons of time killing missions, but I'm the type of gamer that needs purpose. A strong reason for grinding a boring battle system.The worst part of the game for me was the savaging. Looting everything for parts to upgrade crappy guns. Then not having room for anything else. I was annoyed way to much with this game.In closing, This game is a great rental, but I would not buy this at retail cost.\"

I've played over 25 hours and still at only 20% complete+Characters and Cinematic scenes are, as always, top-notch work+Buddy system allows for backup on missions and side ops. Quiet is very handy to have as cover fire.Negatives:- Huge open worlds are pointless if theres barely anything in it. Both Africa and Afghanistan are huge in area but little in content. Small outposts and bases are spread wide leaving the map with about 70-80% wasteland.-Side ops and Mother Base staff management become crucial without the game notifying you. I spent a long time defeating a boss only to find that I needed a Transport Specialist staff member to complete the mission, a fact the game did not inform me of. Another frustrating hour of searching the internet and the maps for this specialist ensued.-Narrative is badly paced. After the prologue it was hours before I progressed the story in any way. Metal Gear Solid has always been excellent example in a narrative driven game but TPP doesnt seem to have much story left to tell and it seems like its a side story to the missions.-Hiding is just pointless in this game. Another key aspect of previous MGS games has vanished. Once you've been discovered the only way of dodging enemies is by fleeing mainly because there are very few places to hide.This is really a 7.5 but for a whole number rating.-Health and Supplies are a huge annoyance in this game. There aren't many supplies around when you need them and the guns cannot hold a lot of ammo meaning you need to constantly call for supply drops. Old system of being able to have all the weapons is gone and replaced by a loadout of 4 weapons max. Also have to hide for long periods to wait for your health to recover instead of using rations while annoying blood spatters on screen reducing your visibility.-Micro-transactions. All that needs to be said about this. Anyone defending micro-transactions in a 40/60 game is an idiot.\"

Other developers may have promised it...but here Kojima delivers, what may be Konami's 'last great game' after firing his chief developer and focusing on mobile gaming (?). No more rough mechanics...everything is smoothed out.  Graphics are beautiful beyond belief...and of course, the crazy MGS plotline...still present.  A candidate for game of the year...for sure. Bravo.\"
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"Perfect!! V has come to! Metal Gear Solid is the best game franchise ever! This is epic! My long wait is over and I'm loving the game!! In the first 12 minutes I got shocked, almost cried, got crazy and excited so much stuff, so much emotion!! GOTY no doubts!"
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"Basically on of the best games I played in my entire life. It may sound weird and suspicious, but damn, this game raise the plank so high that I don't think anyone can beat it. And if they can - I would be damn happy about game industry evolving so fast and becoming so great. Thank you, Kojima Productions and Konami. Keep doing a great job."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"First of all I have been a Metal Gear Fan since 1987 . The series first appeared on the Nintendo entertainment system in the U.S. And on the Famicom entertainment system in Japan . The first metal gear game was a technical marvel back then . The game allowed you to do many things that were not possible before .This series is truly special and holds a place in my heart . Before I beginFirst of all I have been a Metal Gear Fan since 1987 . The series first appeared on the Nintendo entertainment system in the U.S. And on the Famicom entertainment system in Japan . The first metal gear game was a technical marvel back then . The game allowed you to do many things that were not possible before .This series is truly special and holds a place in my heart . Before I begin my review of the phantom pain I'll tell you why . My father hated video games . He deemed them to be mindless and wastes of time . My father was a career military man . He was very strict and did not screw around . One night after attending a church group with neighbors I came home late . He didn't hear me come in the house ( I guess that metal gear stealth training paid off )    I walked out into the family room , and there was my dad . Perched in front of the TV NES controller in hand playing metal gear . I stood there and watched him for a couple minutes . He was having a lot of fun . I then said what are you doing ?. He hurriedly rushed and turned off the system . Unfortunately a few years later he passed .So now you know why this series is so special to me . It was a few years before I played metal gear solid on the playstation . I also played MGS2 MGS3 and 4 as well as VR missions . So basically I'm a metal gear veteran . I will not be revealing story or any kind of spoilers as you will want to experience it all yourself . Let me say this , just the  prologue to this game is mind boggling and jaw dropping . Some of the most tense moments in gaming history are there . As I said I do not want to spoil it but it is nothing short of amazing .Presentation . The presentation on display here is simply astounding . The detail and love put into this game really shine through . The voice acting is top notch the animation is just ridiculously good . Sound and music are absolutely phenomenal. Graphically nothing else touches this game and as stated earlie the sound is great play with a good set of cans on .Gameplay . The gameplay is deep , varried and polished . It's simply a joy to play through this title . Whether traveling on foot , by steed, chopper or bipedal mech there is always a ton to see and do . The depth on display here is staggering and your options on how you approach combat or the lack thereof is simply staggering . While I would say that MGS4 had more fan service moments Phantom Pain still shines brighter . As for cutscenes Kojima is famous for them . So instead of doing away with them completely he's made you the star of them . The transition from cutscenes to gameplay is indiscernible and is absolutely seamless . The control scheme is excellent though if you're a hardcore metal gear fan it may throw you off just a little nothing terrible though . Combat is smooth and satisfying to say the least . You can upgrade your soldier and Mother Base (your staging area ) to your hearts content . Netting you some pretty sweet rewards .Again the prolougue is one of the best moments I've ever experienced in gaming and I'm an old man . It rivals that of GTA5 and the Last Of Us that is really saying something . A legendary gaming series got the retirement it deserved it truly sucks that Konami and Kojima will be going their separate ways . One more thing I'd like to mention . There was a young man during development of the title who received a cancer diagnosis . The young man was a California resident and by my understanding an outstanding young man . Unfortunately he was very very ill . This young man wrote letters to Hideo offering his messages of excitement love and support for one of his favorite series in gaming . Hideo sent him all kinds of autographed collectables and even made him an honorary member of the design team . Saying Sean's messages of support helped motivate the team to produce this masterpiece . Unfortunately Sean passed away before release . Video games don't often have the kind of power to transcend barriers in that capacity . This is something truly special . It's not a game it's a work of art , a work of love , and a thank you to all us fans from not only a great gaming mind but a true gentleman and honorable man . So Hideo and Konami the divorce is final but thanks for all the truly special memories I salute you both rest easy snake you've earned it your 28!year TDY is over honorable discharge :)\"

2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"Some of the best gameplay in videogames and while TPP has fewer cut scenes than previous games, there is enough story in this game. Listen to tapes and do important side ops. I have reached Africa (second area in the game ) yesterday and so far, MGS V is one of the best games I have ever played."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"The game is structurally sound and plays as one would expect a modern Metal Gear Solid game to play. Graphically it's better than most and the gameplay is pretty good. I have a few quibbles about the play, such as Big Boss' movement - he feels sluggish, almost drunk - and some pretty unrefined gunplay, but these quibbles aren't really that big of a deal.

I have a few quibbles about the play, such as Big Boss' movement - he feels sluggish, almost drunk - and some pretty unrefined gunplay, but these quibbles aren't really that big of a deal. The narration is ho-hum and sometimes absolutely annoying, especially when getting harassed a bunch at Mother Base. But I could list a dozen games that are infinitely worse in this aspect.The problem I'm having with the game is that I'm finding it all so dreadfully BORING. I've enjoyed every Metal Gear game since its inception back on the NES, including the movie-fest that was MGS4, but for some reason MGS5 just doesn't really make me want to keep playing. So far it's missing the ""WOW! DID YOU SEE THAT!"" factor. The game features large terrains but they're are mostly bereft of life outside of your side ops and main mission areas. 15 hours in and I'm already tired of the samey repetition of the game's mission designs.The open world design doesn't seem all that impressive because most of the time is spent just traversing to predetermined destinations. But it's sure beautiful to look at. Also, the microtransactions really grate my nerves. I don't understand how anyone can defend this behavior. I don't think this is a Kojima design - I'm almost certain this was forced into the game by Konami.(Sorry, posted this here when I meant to put it in the PC reviews.)\"
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"All you gotta know its that this is not a GTA game, its an open world military infiltration game with awesome story, infinite replayability and lots of stuff to do, the reviewers who say the game is crap have rated the game crap already 3 times in a row within 3 hours, they are obviously trying to change peoples minds, but, please, give it a try, you won't regret it"

The ones who enjoyed the long cutscenes of older games (especially MGS 4) might be a tad disappointed at the fact that The Phantom Pain does not have 30 minute cutscenes but it more than compensates with a lot more gameplay.I will admit that at times the missions got a tad bit repetative  and the maps become somewhat uninteresting after awhile kind of like a ""been there done that"" thing , but  the funny thing about that is the game never felt boring at all, which may not make sense but you would just have to play it to know what I mean.The game is beautiful and there is tons of content, you are definatly getting your moneys worth.Gameplay- 10Sound- 10Graphics- 9.5Story - 9.5Value- 1049/50\"

2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"I simply cannot understand how this game is getting so much praise. I'm a huge Metal Gear Solid fan and I was really looking forward to it. But when I finally started this game, playing the opening sequence I couldn't help but feel sort of numb to everything that was happening. Sure it was cool but something was missing. Only about 30 hours later and after nights of sleeplessness where I tried to figure out why I wasn't satisfied with the game it hit me. There is no heart to it. The gameplay sure ist pretty good and it is a lot of fun. The world's are empty though and Kojima Productions had no idea how to make an open world that is diverse and feels natural. The worst part of this game is without a doubt the story. The first chapter was somehow bearable, although it felt so unfinished and things that got introduced were never explained or continued later on. The second chapter though is the worst part. It feels like they needed to throw everything they had left together just to make the story a little bit longer in the end. Quiet is an awful character and I don't feel ashamed for my ""words and deeds"" about her attire but that I actually defended her all this time only to learn about the utterly stupid reason she's wearing a bikini in battle. I feel ashamed for playing this game when I see her weird, hyper-sexual movements in some cutscenes and especially that stuff in the rain. The forced romance between her and 'Snake' that the story tries to shove down your throat somewhere in the middle of the game, again with no build up is so painful and cringe-worthy to look at. Also there is nothing controversial in this game that hasn't been done in other games already. Children with guns? In The Last of Us you play as a child while you're murdering people. Now I know child-soldiers are a real thing but it's so weirdly implemented in this game and doesn't really add much. Quiet being almost raped and tortured? Well that is a bad thing but the fact that men get raped too is not acknowledged at all. These scenes just feel like the game is forcing you to feel sorry for her all of a sudden. Skull Face is a silly, pathetic character that feels almost unimportant to the story. I could go on for hours. The thing that I hate most about this game is that stupid twist at the end that creates more plot-holes than it does actually explain something. It's just so stupid and unnecessary. There is no downfall of Big Boss. He doesn't become evil because of the events he has to go through. Finding out that you're playing as the medic from Ground Zeroes just makes me say one thing ""Why should I even care?"" There are just so many things wrong with this game's narrative that it's hard to mention all of them.Kojima you f***ed up big time. The only sad thing about it is that all these talented people dedicating their lives all these years to make this game are never really acknowledged behind all the praise Kojima is getting. The presentation is phenomenal, exceptional. Motion capture and cinematography is outstanding, graphics are beautiful. The soundtrack is so memorable and always fitting and the gameplay is pretty good, but all that isn't enough to save the game from it's poorly executed story and characters.\"

The last great creative best embacarse half before an uncertain future outside Konami work is undoubtedly the most complete epic saga. Not only solid in each section, it is outstanding in each. Epic gameplay, amazing graphics, history of stroke, bso unforgettable ... V HAS TO COME."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"Oh god Kojima, why?I wanted to love this game, I wanted it to be epic and a worthwhile closure to one of of my favorite series of all time, and for the most part, I thought: ""This is my GotY 2015"". But then, close to the finish line, it stumbles and destroys every enjoyment I could have, instead replacing it with frustration and Game Design decisions I just cant understand.Metal GearOh god Kojima, why?I wanted to love this game, I wanted it to be epic and a worthwhile closure to one of of my favorite series of all time, and for the most part, I thought: ""This is my GotY 2015"". But then, close to the finish line, it stumbles and destroys every enjoyment I could have, instead replacing it with frustration and Game Design decisions I just cant understand.Metal Gear Solid V The Phantom Pain proves that you can never expect a good Game to stay good.But where do I start?MGSV does a lot of things right.+The Gameplay has never been this good in a Metal Gear Game. Seriously, the sneaking is fun and engaging, and the open world aspect makes you truly want to explore.+The graphical Quality is pretty good and this game runs at 60fps instead of the standard 30, while also not feeling like it sacrificed visual quality for that.+The Game is Gigantic, with me spending over 60 hours with roughly 70% Completion.+The Score has never been so perfectly mixed, every single track feels like it belongs to where it is played, and really makes some scenes really emotional.+The cinematics are beautiful, engaging and really great, making this one of the closest experiences to an interactive movie.This all sounds great, doesnt it? So why do I rate this game relatively low?-While the Gameplay is great, it was never the strong point of Metal Gear Solid t begin with, at least not for me. I always played this games for the Story, and the Story in this Game is one of the worst in the series, being played completely by the numbers and an ending that makes you feel like you just wasted all the Time you played Metal Gear Solid V.-While the Open world is pretty Big, it also gets pretty samey pretty damn fast, making you loose interest after a few hours already.And my biggest gripe:This Game takes the Peace Walker approach in storytelling in which you have a main Chapter that is pretty basic storytelling wise, and an ""Epilogue"" which is aimed to complete the Story. First of all, reaching that ending is a chore. You are forced to replay Missions from earlier in the Game, just on a higher difficulty Setting.Not only does that make no narrative sense, But Metal Gear Solid V cranks it up to 11, having missions where you can get One-Shot less then 1 Second in. No Room for Error, no Fairness. That is not Fun, just Punishing.It is funny that i would say this about MGSV, a game in development for what feels like an eternity, but it needed more Time. The Final chapter feels like it was meant to be accompanied by Gameplay, but they had to scrap that and instead just recycled older levels.It is sad that it had to end like this. I truly wanted to Love this Game and for the Most Part, it felt like this would be the best Metal Gear, and a true ending to the Series, but everything it left was an awful aftertaste.\"
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"Metal Gear Solid V should remind us why we play games in the first place. There is a clear focus from beginning to end that gameplay in this franchise is important, and it shows from the small details within. It's the small details that can make a current gen game like this so good. The replay value can be perfected by the Mother Base alone."
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"I'm really not sure where all the positive feedback comes from... Yes - the gameplay is great, but that's all what MGS is about...This was supposed to be the ultimate MGS STORY, THE MISSING LINK. What did we get? A convoluted story about a double without emotions, without his own personality. With a villan that means absolutely nothing to the series, who's personality is basicaly what venom should have been...The whole Chapter 2 is an unfinished mess, that starts with an awesome trailer when we expect the real **** to hit the fan, but nothing really happens... Then, out of nowhere, we are given the most awfully delivered ending in the MGS history. There's no build up, no interesting cutscenes. Everything happens ""because reasons"", and that they had no time to implement a proper storyline to the game.And the disguisting ending itself, where someone thought that would be necessary to target the game to suicidal teenagers and help them feel better about themselves... YOU ARE BIG BOSS LOL.Thank god they let Kojima go so he won't disappoint that much any more...\"

2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"The best game probably played in recent memory, gameplay is something no other game has done. The various ways to combat missions and how the enemy adapts keeps things fresh and increases the replayability.The controls are very smooth as well, the 60fps surely helps and the frame rate never drops. In a massive game like this it is admirable.The depth of the game also is very good, from weapons and base building to the various staff members with their own skills and attributes. Side ops and dispatch missions also helps add depth to this game. The base building mecahnics and currency is done well and very balanced, it is rare that you will need to grind for certain items, but people would do enjoy going on extra missions get rewarded nicely. Very different from the traditional MGS games, this is a game that is very friendly for newcomers.Which leads to the one controversial point you could say. The story. As a long time mgs fan i'm somewhat disappointed, not so of the 'twist' and body double but because we never really saw the darkness and the theme of revenge that Kojima promise. This was meant to be where we see BB transition to a darker person, according to Kojima and the build up to the game. And i'm left feeling that the ending is very open and it doesn't seem like a game to close the series to be honest, storywise that is. I may have been expecting to much of the story (maybe a bit of SS vs BB would've been a nice touch) but again that is down to me just being a long time fan. Also due to a lack of memorable boss fights and cutscenes i can't help but feel this is the most un-MGS game to date, not necessarily a bad thing as it still is a brilliant game, but some of the older fans may not enjoy this new style. After investing years in the other games and their twisted complex stories, this one falls short on that aspect.Overall it still deserves a 10 and possible could be GOTY,  the positives far outweighs the lack of story, of which i think only heavily affects long time MGS fans.\"

However, as many times as you see his name appear on every mission, sadly, this isn't A HIDEO KOJIMA GAME!Phantom Pain's fox engineMetal Gear Solid 5 Review (Spoiler Free) -Ever since I've seen the first trailer of MGS 5, i haven't been able to contain my hype. Waiting for the long awaited GOTY 2015 has been hard and finally getting to play it as soon as it launched was a treat. However, as many times as you see his name appear on every mission, sadly, this isn't A HIDEO KOJIMA GAME!Phantom Pain's fox engine is amazing, showcasing a new era of open world fun that can be had in the 8th gen of gaming. However, Kojima's so called conclusion to the epic saga is a big fail. MGS 5 is an open world game with mechanics picked up from Far Cry, Splinter Cell & some other 3rd person shooters. What the game doesn't pick is anything from its previous Metal Gears.Metal Gear Solid 4 remains my favourite game of all time not just because of its amazing story but also its boss battles. And Phantom Pain fails to deliver on both. The game's story is left on a cliched cliffhanger and the game has a total of 1 Boss Battle. The hype with which i started the game died down each moment I progressed towards the end.The game is divided into 3 sections - Prologue, Chapter 1 & Chapter 2.The prologue features some amazing cutscenes with chapter 1 featuring 31 missions to the finale. While some of these missions are really amazing, most are repetitive and sloppy. The game's initial impressions make you say that its a GOTY, however by the end of chapter 1, you witness a boss battle which is nothing but a bullet sponge.(felt like i was playing a Destiny boss battle, shoot rockets till death... urgh!)What's even more disappointing is Chapter 2, which has 19 missions, 12 of which are basically missions from Chapter 1 on higher difficulty which need to be completed in a specific way, stealing away your freedom of open world tactical espionage. The way you want to play doesn't exist anymore in Chapter 2 which makes you question the existence of the open world.Metal Gear Solid 5 was the most hyped game of 2015 and Kojima does nothing but disappoint. I look back at MGS 4 and see nothing but laziness from Konami & Team in this game. A lack of boss battles, the sheer lack of the amount of Kojima quantity cutscenes & the exact same missions in Chapter 2 makes me glad that i spent only $60 on this game and no more.Phantom Pain from no angle is 2015's GOTY & while i am not interested in Fallout 4 as of now, i hope its much better than this.\"
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,Although all we MGS fanboys should be high.But this crap is just an average game with feign tactic and stupid funky story.Open world?

I can't express this enough, but the AI is a sham of what previous games were. You can stand in front of them and they won't notice you (WITHOUT THE CHICKEN HAT).Also, and this may be a small point to point out, Kojima made it a point to say, ""screw you Konami,"" but I have to say I do NOT ENJOY SEEING HIS NAME AT THE END OF EVERY MISSION! We get it... you made the game, you emphasized that enough with your 2014 easter eggs of Ground Zeroes, but as human beings, your emphasis on stupid **** is pointless.Imagine seeing a movie where the credits rolled every 5 minutes. This would be outrageous. I personally do not enjoy this game but many others do, it is a good game overall but I can't vouch for it. I don't enjoy it and I don't like it. The graphics are amazing. The story is probably awesome but I'll never know. I spent about 20 hours in and I stopped playing. I hate it. I don't like what the modern age of gaming has done to people and the medium in general. This is my protest. This is my non 10/10 review and my non 0/10 review. I give this game, in my opinion a fair score, the mediocre 7/10 that I feel it deserves. Kojima could have done better for his final game for the company but instead he decided to troll the ever living dog **** out of it. there may be 400+ positive reviews for this game on metacritic. I honestly hope that I can convince at least one person to use an objective mind before purchasing this game, however.It's not fun, it looks great, but it is shallow. SHALLOW to the 10/10 extreme reviews that this game is getting.10/10 Kojima, **** YOU. After 20 years of loving your products and story, I have to say, I hate you now...Rant/Over. Metal Ger fo LIFE.

Why is that? First, it's an open world game. Now mind you, I have nothing against open world games. Open world games can be a blast if done right. Since this is the first time Metal Gear has gone open world, I had high expectations that they'd not only meet but exceed their competitors when it came to creating a world that you actually want to explore. I mean, what is the point of making an open world game if it's not interesting to traverse? If you're not going to do that, just make it a linear game like prior games in the series and perfect each space by littering them full of interesting things to see and do. And here is my first complaint with Metal Gear Solid 5. The open world is uninteresting. You have Africa and Afghanistan. Both overly brown, void of much life, and little to hold your interest while moving throughout the world. While there are side missions sprinkled throughout the world, the side missions are, sadly enough, entirely filler content that does little to add to the game. Actually, they sort of detract from the game overall. Instead of creating a linear, narrative-driven Metal Gear Solid, they've created an open world, one that doesn't have anything interesting going on in it, and then try to throw in some copy & paste side missions that are incredibly uninteresting and by-the-numbers in their design. But, then, the story must be good, especially if you're a Metal Gear fan, right? Wrong. For whatever reason, Konami replaced their old voice actors with new, more recognizable actors. For example, instead of David Hayter, we get Kiefer Sutherland. Not only does his performance fail in comparison to Hayter's, he rarely even talks throughout the game. And here's another issue, there's barely any cutscenes compared to the prior Metal Gear's. While I'll concede that prior Metal Gear's may have been overkill when it came to cutscenes, but they've swung the pendulum so far from that that there's not enough now. I do agree that the gameplay here is solid and enjoyable, but when the world it takes place in, the narrative that surrounds, and the extra content is so poor, I can't give it praise that it simply doesn't deserve. If you're a fan of open world games, this will disappoint you. If you're a fan of Metal Gear Solid's past, this will disappoint. As a fan of both, I'm floored that people are giving this game high marks. I can only surmise that it's because people were really hyped about it and now they're forgiving issues that they'll soon come to dislike. As is the case very often with people who play games and people who write about them, they sometimes overlook glaring issues when they release and then only come to grips with the fact that the game wasn't all that years down the road. Metal Gear Solid V is one such game.\"
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"This game is like an ice cream from your youth. An ice cream containing all your favorite ingredients: vanilla, chocolate, toffee and some rainbow sprinkles on top.The ice cream stayed the same during 30 years, and you loved it during all this time. Suddenly the manufacturer decides to cater to the masses that only wants vanilla ice cream. The chocolate, toffee and the sprinkles are gone, ruining the ice cream for the people who loved it to begin with.This what I feel happened to the game. Everything that made metal gear solid good is gone with this game, to make a game to cater to the casual crowd who only want to shoot some guards. No more cutscenes, no story progression and on top of that an ending that defecates on the rest of the series like D-horse does on the enemies in this game.It's a sad way to say good bye to the series.

Snakes voice was replaced by some random Hollywood-dude, there are no codec conversations, items need to be selected with an awkward combination of d-pad and the right stick, Snake apparently turned into a vampire, because his injuries magically disappear after a few seconds instead of needing medical treatment etc. All those little details. Boss battles, story and even Snakes personality are practically non-existent. The worst thing, however, is the terrible game design: select a mission, land in the mission area, go from A to B, leave the mission area, rinse and repeat, get bored to death.  Yeah, that's the whole game, open world obviously doesn't work for MGS...If you actually liked MGS 1-3 or even 2008s Metal Gear Soap Opera (which now seems great in comparison) then MGS5 isn't your game of the year, it's the disappointment of the decade.\"

Cutscenes go on far too long, taking the game out of ""video game"".- Japanese perversion is present throughout, which makes the game feel very cringeworthy. The character of Quiet is the worst offense of many issues.- Clunky gameplay that hardly ever works in your favor.- Boring, uninspired open world environments littered with generic enemies and locales.- Doesn't make you feel cool in the way a game should. Animations look more awkward than anything else.Honestly, I don't understand what people see in this game...\"

Let me start by saying that metal gear solid 5 is definitely an incredible game, and is unlike any other game ever  made and probably unlike anything that will  ever be made. the gameplay  is undoubtedly the strongest and most incredible part of the game. No other game uses an open world environment  as a part of the gameplay as well as the phantom pain. exploring the beautiful open deserts of Afghanistan and the wet jungles and barren plains of Africa is fun but what makes the open world so great is how its terrain, weather, time of day and enemy bases placed in the world plays a huge role in how you decide to go about your missions and the enormous amount of resources and gadgets you have at your disposal gives an endless amount of gameplay styles and options while in the field.  the game leaves everything up to you and does not hold your hand at all, allowing you create your own war stories unique to you. I genuinely feel that any one else who plays this game will have a completely different experience than I did when it came to how they went about completing their missions and that's pretty freaking awesome, in fact this has alot to do with the games key themes that are reveled at the end of the game, which I will not spoil for you. every mission is memorable and well directed and realized and are extremely enjoyable, until you get into the post game, which is my biggest issue of the game. unfortunately the director of the game hideo kojima did not get all the time he needed to finish the game how he intended, and the game was rushed by the publishers of the game. This left the last ten or so missions being recycled missions from earlier in the game with the difficulty of the missions being ramped up. this is extremely disappointing because the meat of the story is in these final chapters of the game and the narrative doesn't flow at all because the missions don't translate into whats going on near the end and its such a shame that we couldn't play the missions kojima could have made if he was given the time. The story of the game is the most controversial topic it seems when it comes to the game, which I wont spoil, but I will say the main story until the post missions start is pretty straight forward and easy to follow. The cut scenes are beautifully directed and the voice acting is superb, and the main story is actually quite compelling even though it doesn't have the amount of revelations and plot twists fans may have expected, but the incredibly profound ideas and themes the franchise is known for is still all there in spades, especially in the post game. The post game and ending are where people are really divided on this game, and when I played through the ending of this game, I was dumbfounded by the twist and to be honest quite angry, but after a day or two thinking about it and trying to figure out what kojima was trying to do with this ending, I ended up loving it and I feel that much like metal gear solid 2, people are going to be really upset about it for a while, but as the years go by and people think about it more, people are going to appreciate what the ending was trying to do and I think people will start seeing how incredible of a game and a work of art this game is. I would love to give this game a 10 but because of the recycling of older missions by the end and how it breaks up the flow of the narrative, I cant, but I do believe this game is a masterpiece.\"

But it is a damn fine goodbye to all of the fans of the franchise. I love how much there is to do, the challenge of the missions, the variety of the weapons and outfits, the complexity of the world, and the fact that this is the only game on my PS4 that I can tell is running at 60 FPS that isn't a remaster. My only complaints are that story is lackluster at times, and online is very mediocre unless you're playing with friends. Otherwise, thank you, Kojima. This was worth the wait.\"
2015,Metal Gear Solid V,"MGSV is a controversial Metal Gear game. Some gamers will find it the best MG ever made, while others will see it as a big disappointment.No doubt its not a typical Metal Gear game, and fans are complaining about the story (or the lack of it) and some changes made by Kojima.Its not a secret that Kojima wanted to move away from Metal Gear games.

Some gamers will find it the best MG ever made, while others will see it as a big disappointment.No doubt its not a typical Metal Gear game, and fans are complaining about the story (or the lack of it) and some changes made by Kojima.Its not a secret that Kojima wanted to move away from Metal Gear games. MGSV feels more like a spin-off, or a side story. Make no mistake, its not Metal Gear Solid 5, its actually V. V might stands for Venon, the major character in the game, or for peace sign, and indicates this game actually a sequel to Peace Walker.So, in Metal Gear Solid V Kojima actually moves away from the traditional concepts of previous games. The story is not in front of you, if I can put this way, but its a disservice to say the game has a poor storytelling, or even doesn't have a story at all. Its more like 2001, Space Odyssey, or like the first Alien, where there is a big plot behind whats happening in the screeen, but requires interpretation from the audience, very different from last games where you can just sit and watch long cutscenes.That was a change I believe came for good. Metal Gear games always had a b-movie flavor, with ridiculous lines, over the top anatogonists and some way too silly moments, that made impossible to take serious all the topics about death, loyalty, sacrifice, nuclear ploriferation. The more serious topics sounded way too pretentious and made the whole thing sound as cheesy as cheesy can be.In Ground Zeroes, it was already clear Kojima was changing MG's tone to a more darker and let's say mature tone. Paz, a screaming young lady that happend to be the final boss in Peace Walker, returned as a tragic character. The cartoonish David Hayter was replaced by Kiefer Sutherland, and that alone make a huge difference. David Hayter performance was always unnatural, forced and theatrical, and was one of the reasons for MG games silly and cheessy tone. He was the perfect snake for a polygonal  snake from ps1 and ps2 era, but with games getting closer and closer of movie's language, a new Snake was required, and Kiefer was the perfect fit for a tragic character like Venon.Some over the top moments are still here and there, like main villain Skullface and Quiet's outfit (she happens to be a strong character, despite the juvenille approach in her presentation during the whole game), but MGSV is a pretty strong game in terms os story. Its a tragic one, that won't suit a happy ending. Its a story about loss and revenge, about buddies departing and neve returning, about your own identity getting stolen, about living as a phanton of someone else. The main character of the game is called ""Punished"". The Paz side story in this game give us one of the most powerful moments in video games story.The plot twist in the end of the game is Kojima not playing for the gallery, as he did in Metal Gear Solid 4, a game that actually ended Big Boss and Solid Snale story.The gameplay is stellar, but don't approach MGSV as an rpg or GTA V game, so you won't find civillians around the world. You are playing in large areas controlled by military groups. Every single mission you can approach the way you want. There is so much to develop, the game hardly gets boring even after hours and hours of gameplay. You can go full rambo, or you can have a 100% stealth experience.  Few games got companions right as MGSV. Your buddies are part of the experience, and support coming from Quiet e D-Dog are crucial for completing some missions.Developing itens, armor and weapons are more complex than many rpg games around, since requires rational manegement of resources.Graphics are superb. There is no game around with better facial animations coming from characters. The landscapes, specially in Afganhistan, are amazing. Fox engine improved a lot since Ground Zeroes, and its almost flawless here. The shooting experience is as funny as possible, and a big for me was the 1st person perspective while pressing R1 button.Fulltoning soldiers and everything else seems something ridiculous at first, but after a while, believe me, you will miss that feature in other games.The open world adds an element of unpredictabilty here. If you wait too long to make decisions, the sun might appear and make everything more difficult for you, even though you can speed up the time by somoking weird cigar. A sand storm might save the day and hide you enough time to complete an objective, or a truck full of soldiers might appear in the base and force you to activate a plan B. Even of you capture an outpost, that doesn't mean everything is safe, since the soldiers of the next shift might be just arriving.The game's structure is a problem, though, since the ""Chapter 2"" is actually a epilogue, and most of main missions are actually repeated ones, while some os best momensts are hidden as side ops.MGSV is my 2015 Game of The Year. A masterpiece. MGSV is Kojima at his best.\"

Oh, and I played MGS2,3,MGSR, MGS5GV before.Graphics (7) - The game looks great but the terrain and the scenes lack variation.Story (6) - Well, the entire mission select thing, open world, and side ops let you feel the story isn't continuous. And they contain too much information in cassette tape rather than computer graphics or mission intel. Also the story feels uncompleted at last(rumors that they deleted the last mission). And unlike the other series I played before, I am not touched. Since I don't want to leave spoiler here, I won't say too much. The previous games always give me a big advice to my life, but this time I just feel empty.Gameplay(9) - The fusion of open-world and development  of mother base is what makes me feel fresh this time. A single item or weapon can be used at many situations, terrains, and individuals. The devs really poured many time into this part. I keep finding new things about gameplay for like three months. I just need to say I love the game mechanic so much. A few gameplay videos can give you a rough idea about that.Music (9) - You have to admit that Kojima really good at choosing music, and the soundtracks are also good too. And that's also an important key to make MGS success.Performance (8) - Stable frame rate, the loading time between mother base and mission area is a little long. But you won't notice when you free roam. And I didn't encounter bugs that need to mention here, also the game is well optimized.Let me mention a few things I haven't written down.//The impression of  prologue is same as Ground Zeroes(MGSV:GV) let the other part of game feels nothing.//The personal participate in each mission is mentioned at the start of mission which spoiled the surprised.//You literally own an army that supports you, the more effort you pay the easier the mission are.//Body systems give the stealth game noob like me a big help, but made the game too easy for pro.//Although they are dynamic difficulties, but they can actually merge three difficulties option into a single mission.And many of them, but I don't want to spoiled the fun. I strongly suggest this game for you, no matter you are a MGS fan or not. This is definitely one of great titles in 2015.\"

There is a surprising amount of different weapons for a game focused on stealth and several buddies offering diverse gameplay styles. You get your own Mother base that essentially becomes a simulation of having your own private army, a pretty fun mini-game that adds several hours into an already large game. The map is thankfully detailed with lots of secrets as the maps aren't that big and unfortunately sends you to similar locations when playing side ops. The biggest problem this game has is that compared to previous games with HOURS of cutscenes and story, this game has a lot less. Depending on your previous stance you may or may not welcome this change as it is clearly meant to make the game more accessible to franchise newcomers.  What story that is there is still engaging however. MGSV is a game that should be played by all, even if you haven;t played any previous games.\"
2015,Super Mario Maker,"Simply the best idea Nintendo has ever had! Super Mario Maker is a masterpiece that can be played and created for years to come! If you still don't own a Wii U and consider yourself a gamer, now is the time to switch over to pure gaming bliss! I can't give a higher recommendation - a must own! Well done Nintendo! 10/10"
2015,Super Mario Maker,"What makes a Mario game fun? Is it the story? Doubt it. Is it the character development? Probably not. Is it the simplistic, yet challenging, level design that allows you to think that you've ""got it this time"" and makes you feel a sense of accomplishment when you finally do? For me, absolutely. Now you're telling me that there's a game where I get to design my own levels in great detail in worlds that have been revered as some of the most iconic in gaming? Give it to me now!Mario Maker is just that, a game that allows you to play the same game you've been playing for 30 years, but with the added notion that you can literally create your own levels and played the created levels of other players worldwide. That, as a concept, is too cool to pass down.The game allows you to play in the game worlds from the original Super Mario Bros, Super Mario Bros 3, Super Mario World, and Super Mario Bros U. Each world has their own physics and unique gameplay mechanics, so every level feels like you are playing it within that title. There are also an incredible number of unlocks including secret costumes in the original Super Mario Bros world and over 50 creative items for you to build your dream course. Every completionist out there will have their work cut out for them and have a lot of fun doing it.You, as a player, now have the opportunity to make a level as exciting as you want or as difficult as you want and share it with your friends and the world. With themes being a big part of level design in Mario history, the addition of the secret costumes, unlocked by using amiibo or simply playing the game, will allow you to create innovative and fun levels based on other characters from the Nintendo universe, like Link, Marth, Pikachu, and even Mega Man. If they have an amiibo, the (almost) always can be played in this game.Without a doubt, this is one of the greatest Mario experiences of all time. While it may not be without its flaws, those flaws were there when you played that game before. The idea is not to create a whole new game, but to allow you to become a part of your favorite games from the past. It's truly innovative, fun, and absolutely endless, more than giving enough unique gameplay to warrant the standard price of a game. If you own a Wii U, you should leave right now and buy this game. If you don't have a Wii U, I strongly suggest you at least consider the purchase just for this experience.\"

2015,Super Mario Maker,"Incredibly easy to use and fun to play, if you find the right levels, of course. and if you are a completionist  you'll have a blast collecting all the costumes in the game. my only complaint is that it doesn't make full use of all that the super mario series has to offer, hopefully extra content will fix that."
2015,Super Mario Maker,This is brilliant. Very addictive to both play and create and is great with the family.

The game was blocky, straightforward and absolutely spectacular.The game hasn\t aged a bit. It\s been spiced and spruced and given plenty of coats of paint, but Mario is still Mario, and Super Mario Maker, a new title for the Nintendo Wii U, lets you play God with the Mushroom Kingdom.The game, billed as a do-it-yourself level creator, lets players choose between four distinct aesthetics: Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 3, Super Mario World and New Super Mario Bros. U. Players can choose to \make\ or \play\ on the game\s menu. While making levels, each world has its own music and items, and every bit of the original game is intact, physics and all.Equipped with the Wii U GamePad, players use the touchscreen to build their levels. But in all honesty, some of us aren\t so good at making things. But that\s where the real meat of Super Mario Maker comes in: sharing.Players can share their levels to \Course World\ or download levels made by gamers from around the globe. Give the game a few months and if you\ve got an idea for a level, chances are someone will have made it by then.Then there\s the \play\ mode. This includes \10-Mario Challenge,\ in which 10 levels are randomly selected for the player to traverse. In \Course World\ this challenge gets amped up a bit to \100-Mario Challenge\ and the game gives you 100 lives to make it through 10 randomly selected user-created levels. That means the level could be super-simple or gruelingly difficult. Roll the dice and take a chance.The game also supports Nintendo\s toys-to-life figurines, Amiibo, and they have an unbelievably addictive and wallet-damaging use. Just tap an Amiibo character to the base of the Wii U GamePad and the player can step into the shoes of 100 different icons like Link from The Legend of Zelda, Samus Aran from Metroid and even some more obscure ones like Chibi-Robo and the creepy owl from Animal Crossing.Amiibo usually cost $10 to $12, but the characters are completely unlockable in-game by playing the \100-Mario Challenge\ mode. Relax, parents: It may be one less thing you\ll need to spend money on.Rest assured, Super Mario Maker is a delight. It\s a player-created wonderland packed full of content and a blast to play.One can only wonder what Nintendo has planned for future Mario anniversaries.- Nicholas Friedman, Denton Record-Chronicle\"

I actually got into Mario Maker because I thought playingSuper Mario Maker is the next big milestone in the 2D Mario series after New Super Mario Bros. Going into the game with relatively low expectations, I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of fun I actually had with this title.Mario Maker's gameplay is clearly divided into two big facets: playing levels and creating levels. I actually got into Mario Maker because I thought playing other people's levels was going to be the really entertaining. To be honest, I've never really cared about the level creation. Being able to create my own Mario levels is something that has never got me excited, despite being a fan of 2D Mario platformers. But surprisingly, making levels ended up being my favorite part of the experience by far.One thing that should be noted if you\re planning to play Mario Maker is that this is a game that takes an active effort from your part to be truly enjoyable. This isn\t a game that you just put and enjoy. Well, you can do that if you only play levels, but to get the most out of Mario Maker it takes a bit of creativity and effort from the player. Initially I thought this was going to be a problem for me, believing that I would be staring at a blank level creator without any ideas on what to make at all. But fortunately, once you start messing around with the tools you\re given, fun ideas just emerge naturally. And once you get on a streak of creativity, that\s when Mario Maker realizes its full potential. That\s when the game becomes truly addicting.The level editor is very accessible and enjoyable to use. Some things are missing, sure, like pools of water, certain enemies, power ups and such, but overall it feels complete. It has a pretty big repertoire of tools from previous Mario games for the player to use. I wish the enemy limit would be a bit higher, but it\s still alright. Mario Maker is very self aware that people are going to create stupid and nonsensical levels, and because of this the game offers a lot of tools for doing just that, crazy levels that are pure nonsense.The presentation is very good. The developers clearly intended to make this game as user friendly as possible. The game is full of silly gags and secrets. Like once I got a notification with a random philosophical quote involving chain chomps. Funny things like that are all over the place.The online functionalities are well optimized. Uploading your courses and seeing other people give you stars and comments is always satisfying. You can even see the parts of your levels where people die, and also the clear percentage. There are also official courses uploaded by Nintendo, which are pretty good.But there\s a problem with Mario Maker\s online. One that anyone will notice very soon. The problem is that nobody in the world knows how to make good levels, or even decent ones. 90% of the levels are either a cakewalk made by a 5 year old, troll levels, levels that play themselves, levels full of dumb gimmicks, or in the opposite side, levels that are so hard that nobody but a hardcore Mario player can enjoy. There are good levels every now and then, and playing bad levels can be fun and even hilarious at first, but the novelty wears off quickly. There is always some fun to be had with 100 Mario challenges and such, and this is definitely a good option to have around if you feel like playing some Mario, but if you want to play good Mario levels that are actually well done, you better stick to New Super Mario Bros U.So overall, this is a game that never caught my attention because I didn't care about making my own Mario levels, but once I started playing it and dedicating myself to creating levels, Mario Maker finally clicked on me. I could finally see what all the people saw back in 2014 when the game was announced. Mario Maker was truly a great way to celebrate the ex-plumber's 30th anniversary, and is a game I can totally recommend to anyone interested in 2D Mario, creating platformer levels, or game design in general.Score: 8.5\"

That may be enough for some people, but the game is extremely limited, which hurts creative potential.  Also, the unlock system is one of the worst I've ever come across.  I'd rather have every item available from the start, since the starting items are really not enough to build anything noteworthy.  An unlock mechanism was simply unnecessary, since the level of content is lackluster to begin with.

Whatever day job tasks I had in front of me, I could only focus on one thing: the Mega Man-themed level I was going to make when I got out of work, bought my shiny new copy of Super Mario Maker, and scurried home. That's the kind of thing Super Mario Maker does to you: the very idea of such a game-slash-development-tool, a first in the Mario franchise, and quite likely the defining Wii U gamepad-centric title, is enough to inspire obsession.I believe there are two kinds of people who will want this game; let's call them Teddy and Jimmy. Teddy wants Super Mario Maker because he can't wait to see what shenanigans other players will come up with. He doesn't feel particularly excited with the creative challenges of coming up with his own levels, and as such that aspect of the game doesn't appeal to him. Is Super Mario Maker a worthy buy to Teddy? Perhaps. I can't really tell, because I am no freaking Teddy. No, my friends, I'm a Jimmy. In fact, I'm the Jimmiest Jimmy you can get.You see, Jimmy fancies himself a creator. He likes that extremely satisfying feeling of dreaming something up and watching it unfold. Jimmy likes to write songs, to create stories, to think up ideas for video games. Jimmy spent years as a kid inventing fictional countries with his brother and a couple of friends who lived next door, and went to the trouble of coming up with every imagineable aspect of said countries, from their ancient history to their soccer teams to their musical charts. Okay, maybe it was specifically Rick who did that, but you know what? If you have any crazy creative exercises you like to go through, you're a Jimmy. And you'll love Super Mario Maker.The game is a surprising addition to the Nintendo catalogue and, at the same time, exactly what you'd expect from the Kyoto company. It has one of the most brilliant presentations I've ever seen in a video game, with wit and charm permeating every tiny detail, no matter how inconsequential. It has an extremely well-thought-out interface that's easy to use and get the hang of, and it offers hours upon hours of lighthearted yet challenging fun. Like I said, this is all very Nintendo. What is not is the degree of freedom the game gives you, and that is a very welcoming change of pace for the company.With a gradually-unlocking set of tools that covers a limited chunk (more on that later) of Mario history, Super Mario Maker allows your imagination to go wild. You can make regular Mario stages, of course, and it's very advisable that you start there. As you get the gist of how things work, however, you'll be able to think of novel ideas, interesting ideas, and yes, utterly crazy ideas. Even within its limitations, the game is a veritable blank canvas for a tireless Jimmy mind.The process of unlocking tools is, at first glance, kind of cruel. After fiddling with the ""Make"" mode for five minutes, you have to wait one full day until the next unlockable update... or do you? As it turns out, you don't. If you, like the good Jimmy you are, start obsessing over every new unlocked set, putting it immediately to good use on a new stage, you can get the next delivery in a matter of minutes. This process also helps you start by thinking small, which I hear is very advisable in order to become good in any creative craft.With so many possibilities to pour your hours into, it's hard to fault the game for what it doesn't do. But, my friends, I told you I'm a hardcore Jimmy. I don't merely want to make my stages and call it a day. I want to come up with my own graphic backgrounds. I want to make new enemies and bosses. I want to access more power ups, such as the ice flower or the frog suit. I want to write my own tunes in a Mario Paint-like composer. Sadly, those aren't options here. But hey, downloadable content is a thing, so who knows? Maybe Nintendo isn't done throwing us delicious creative bones just yet.The good news is that, by playing with the available tools, you'll be surprised at the amount of ideas you can build from the ground up. For example, that Mega Man level I wanted to make? I spent fifteen hours (I kid you not) fine-tuning what was a very ambitious idea, and even though I had to make cuts to what I originally envisioned, it worked and I'm very proud of it (it's at 9438-0000-005A-C6FA if you feel like checking it out).So let me flat-out say it: Super Mario Maker is the real deal. I keep occasionally lamenting the lack of a few features (and especially the half-assed music-making options), but those are immensely overshadowed by what I am, in fact, allowed to do in the game, especially on the ""Make"" mode. The pixel-perfect Super Mario physics, as well as the creativity of a big international community, probably make the game still worth it if the only mode you wanna rock is ""Play""... but Teddy boy, let me tell you: you're missing out.Rating: 9.5\"

For sure, but all in all, it makes you want to play it constantly, and its easy to get lost in it, not realizing for how many hours you've played.If you are on the fence, don't be, buy a Wii U and play this, because it is undoubtedly one of the best video games ever made!"

Another addiction to the game is the stars & miiverse once you uploaded a level your going to want to know if your levels have gotten stared or if someone commented on it. This is truly a wonderful game magical even because friends & family will want to play your levels spend time with you going thru community levels it really is that entertaining. If you're debating getting getting this game or a wii u this is the right time & i have all next gen consoles but wii u & this game are ruling my home thank you nintendo you gave us yet another classic game.\"
2015,Super Mario Maker,"A great online Mario game finally hits the market!To start off, let's take a look at the different game level designs to choose from ( Super Mario World, Super Mario Bros. 3, etc.). This method is actually one of the most detailed parts of the game, as each design matters depending on the course, as certain major gimmicks appear through some games, and others don't. Super Mario MakerA great online Mario game finally hits the market!To start off, let's take a look at the different game level designs to choose from ( Super Mario World, Super Mario Bros. 3, etc.). This method is actually one of the most detailed parts of the game, as each design matters depending on the course, as certain major gimmicks appear through some games, and others don't. Super Mario Maker keeps each game true to its original and that is what I found the most impressing.The tutorial is pretty good for new Mario players ( although boring and it could've been better).Another thing that I would like to point out that is so great in the game is the use of different, more complex items as unlockables. I find this to be very essential so the game isn't a freebie with everything when you start the game so you have little to no experience becoming a level designer. Once you have more experience with the basic items, how the unlockables correlate are very well done so the game isn't so confusing.The online mode is amazing, other than some minor missteps. The completion system is perfect, the sections you want to play are easy to reach, and the difficulty setting, especially with the 100-Mario challenge, are mostly well done (despite some issues). The comment section is good, but flawed, as the game takes a ""Minecraft"" approach to online play and no censorship is done for younger players. Nintendo needs to be careful of this. Invisible blocks are a broken way of posting difficult online courses. Personally, I think Nintendo needs a way to stop that.One minor ( but biggest) problem with the game is the lack of some really cool additives that should've been used in the game, mainly the checkpoints.Even though it sounds like I would give this a 7/10, the game is nostalgia-bringer for the older adults/teens and a great start for younger children. Fun for all ages and can bring a challenge, anything you wanted in a Mario world is not limited to many fun features and gameplay that this game brings. The value is a steal! $60 for many greatly designed levels and hours of fun? Therefore, I give this a medium 9/10! Buy this game if you are a Mario fan. NOW!\"
2015,Super Mario Maker,"Best idea of Nintendo a complete e funny game. the creation of a game that the players can create and play, this is for everyone since son  ate grandma"
2015,Super Mario Maker,"Super Mario Maker is a weird game. It tries to create something interesting to players by letting its community create hundreds of levels every day, which sounds really interesting, however this is also its weakness. For example, the game gives you the option to play what it calls ""Courses"" which is divided into 5 categories. One is exclusively used for official levels made by NintendoSuper Mario Maker is a weird game. It tries to create something interesting to players by letting its community create hundreds of levels every day, which sounds really interesting, however this is also its weakness. For example, the game gives you the option to play what it calls ""Courses"" which is divided into 5 categories. One is exclusively used for official levels made by Nintendo itself and people from magazines such as Famitsu and etc. They tend to be quite easy and straighfoward, and at the end of the level you can earn a Mystery Mushroom, which can make Mario transform into a different character (Link, Wario, even Pokmons). You can use these mushrooms to make your levels more interesting. You can also choose to play 4 different type of courses: Easy Course, Normal, Expert and the new Super Expert courses. All this courses were made by the community, not Nintendo. And here's the main core of the game and that's when the whole thing starts to fall apart. You may find yourself playing a lot of interesting levels made by people. Levels that are challenging, engaging and sometimes punishing but not unfair. This is Super Mario Maker at its strongest. You really feel entertained playing this levels and you want to play more of those...But, this is not frequent, actually you'll spend more time playing short, lazy and confusing levels that probably will make you want to throw your controller through the window. Unfortunately most levels are horribly made. They tend to drive you to door traps, unfair deaths and sometimes ask you to use a move so complex or hard to pull that only expert players can do, and you have no choice but too skip (Thank God for this option) these levels and try another one. Sometimes they are too easy to the point of being ridiculous. You pick up a invencibility star and run through dozens of enemies until you hit the final flag pole. You can see how lazy the person is to create something so dull and boring like that. And since the game picks random levels for you to play, there's no way to avoid these kind of unfair or boring levels. But you'll notice this the first half hour that you'll spend playing this game because, unfortunately, there are more boring levels than good ones in this game.Of course SMM is also about creating. And this is the most interesting part of the game. The tools that they provide you to create the levels are awesome. I never thought i'd like to use them so much. You can easily spend 2-3 hours elaborating a level and you can actually have fun creating them and then testing them. It's intuitive, easy to learn and really, you can do anything you want, basically. But be aware, after you upload the level don't expect to have many people playing it. I did 5 or 6 levels and each one had 3 or 4 people playing it. One week later, nothing has changed. Which means that soon my levels will be deleted and forgotten whereas people who made horrible levels managed to get at least 5 stars (the ""Like"" from SMM) or even more, it's frustrating. When you upload a level, the servers tries to put your level into one of the 4 types of courses, but the thing is, you have thousands of levels being made everyday, so sometimes your level will be forgotten and no one will be able to play, unless you have friends to help you out or if you beg on the internet asking anyone to play your level and to give you a star, otherwise you'll lose your levels really soon because Nintendo tends to delete levels that no one plays or ones that don't have many stars.All in all, Super Mario Maker tries to compete against the likes of LittleBigPlanet or even Project Spark. It succeeds? No. Because this game it's limited compared to the other two where you can create dozens of different things using a more flexible tool to create levels. It is entertaining? Yes, if you know the right codes to play the right levels, but if you try to play a whole course, especially Expert or Normal, you'll find a lot of frustrating and horribly made levels that only have the purpose to troll you as much as possible. And to me, challenging is different than trolling. When i play this game i want to play challenging levels that will make me a better player and feel accomplished not frustrated because of invisible blocks or death doors. And the creating tool is awesome, but you'll have to  beg for people to play your levels, otherwise it will be deleted before you know it. At the end of the day i can't really recommend this game at all, apart from the creation tool where you'll have fun creating levels on you own, but that's it. Other than that you'll only find a half game here, an overpriced one. SMM is only as good as its players, and maybe that's why this game is so frustrating and boring, because many people don't know the meaning of having fun, just the meaning of trolling. So if the people who play this game are trolls, then of course the game will be nothing less. Super Mario Maker is the @TayandYou of the Wii U.\"

But when you give people with no experience in level creation the tools and audience to do so, it turns out they squander that opportunity.You can create your own Mario levels, share them with friends, and play other people's levels, but once you realize the levels people upload range from gimmicky ""don't move and watch all the crazy things that almost kill you in this on-rails level,"" to ""look at how insanely difficult this level is because I love Kaizo Mario"" and ""I'm 11 and what is game design,"" you quickly start to feel some buyer's remorse.It's reminiscent of Little Big Planet, where anyone could make levels, but most people make terrible levels. When you make a game where the ONLY thing you can do (besides create your own stages) is play other people's generally lackluster levels.The game controls great, there's multiple game styles you can choose from that actually give you different abilities (original Mario is basic, Super Mario World has spin jumps, New Super Mario Bros has wall-jumping, etc) but when the game's only attempt at a single-player is ""try to beat 10 random user-created levels and be rewarded with literally nothing,"" then you get a game that's basically a really cool gimmick that delivers no extrinsic rewards.There are TONS of cool, interestingly-made levels, but they're absolutely drowned out by the onslaught of terribly made joke levels where you hit a coin block and a bunch of confetti and annoying sound effects pop out, as well as a slew of levels designed to be so hard that you might have found a new fetish by the time you manage to beat it.\"

For being the same price as their AAA titles, this game could have at the very least included Blargg from super Mario world, or you know, hills you can slide down3) User made levels. I commend Nintendo for trying to make a community based game, but 90% of the levels are just horrible. If a level has 5 bowsers, I just quit, there is no fun in that level.4) AGAIN WITH THE CODES?! haven't they learned from the DS that absolutely no one likes friendcodes? the same goes for level codes. I should be able to search based on Miiverse name.In short, Nintendo really missed the mark in my opinion. I am sure they will fix it with DLC, but it shouldn't have to come to that. As a consumer my only request is to get a finished game that I can play from day 1 without needing to unlock everything in order to play. This is 2 games in a row where Nintendo went this route and I am not a fan.Had they finished the game, it would 10/10 for sure, but I can't in good faith give a half finished product anymore than a 6/10\"

You'll be relying on other players to play through courses. While this isn't necessarily a bad thing, a large portion of the community seems dedicated to strange, artful or down right insane stages. There's not nearly enough fun, standard stages to go around.Further, the lack of elements from almost every game, be it enemies, power-ups, game mechanics or elements ruins part of the game. There's a lack of bosses, only featuring bowser and bowser jr. There's no slopes and the stage, music and sound selection leaves something to be desired.Also, the transition between game's enemies and elements don't look look or feel right. I wish they would have limited content to their perspective games instead of allowing so much cross-over content.In the end, much like Mario Paint, it's a unique, intresting concept of a game and tool, but ultimately feels lazy abd half hearted\"

Without a doubt one of the best recent games in terms of replay value. Unfortunately, it can get a bit tedious in the beginning when you're playing purely to unlock the various parts to use in your level. But after that, it's only fun and good times to be had. Even if creating levels is not really your thing, you will have a really great time playing the creations of others. That is, if the levels you play do not involves copious amounts of enemy stacks or several hundred platforms in space. With checkpoints recently added, it would not seem unlikely for some DLC to be rolled out at some point in the future - namely slopes - which would make a lot of people very happy. Super Mario Maker is perhaps not everyone's cup of tea in terms of creating levels, but it's all great Mario goodness. And we love Mario goodness.\"

For free! There are a few additions that aren't available online, such as certain enemies and objects being redrawn for the different games, but there is an appalling lack of Yoshi in any mode. There hasn't been much substantial content added since the game's release either, unlike Splatoon, which has had many more additional game modes, maps, weapons, equipment, and a new level cap, in addition to revamped Ranked gameplay. There's just not much ""fun"" to be had in creating levels, aside from the first few minutes of making a field of clown car-riding giant Bowsers, or something silly like that.On the other side of the coin, playing other people's levels is hit or miss. The levels I enjoyed the most were the musical levels, which played a tune as you held left and ran. These were also my favorite levels in the online version as well, so it was nice to see them return. But aside from that, the tool is too limited to make stages that are actually reminiscent of the official games. The Super Mario World mode is missing the slanted platforms vibe, as well as much of the charm of the world map that made the game most fun to begin with. As such, none of the levels created in Super Mario Maker really 'feel' like an official level made by the devs. They all feel... off. It's clear to see that they are user-created, and as such, are lacking the polish of the official levels.Despite the ""limitless potential"" of ""infinite stages"" from other users; Mario Maker is sadly far too limited to truly make something of value, and its price most certainly does not reflect the amount of content contained therein.\"

2015,Super Mario Maker,"Do you remember that Mario Paint had all those Super Mario Bros. stamps? Did you use them to make ""screenshots"" of your own levels in a mario game you wish you could make? I did, i even put Yoshi in it, which made absolutely no sense at the time, but i didn't care.Well now you can actually make that ""screenshot"" you made in Mario Paint into an actual level, and Nintendo encourages you to make it NOT make sense. Put Bowser in a clown blimp, with 5 other bowsers or heck, anything else on top of him.Or, if that's not your thing, go ahead and play our levels that we made... (why it got a 6, incoming)But that's where it falls, since people have a no rules access, you can get into some pretty nutty stages. Some of which, depending on your 1337 retro Mario skillz. can be simple as a speed run, or an end as soon as you step into a stage.All in all, i agree though, it's a wicked idea, Nintendo....\"

2015,Super Mario Maker,I have mixed feelings about this game. On one hand it is a nice way to create levels and share them with people.

Of course if you want your levels to actually be how you want them to you've entered the real challenge in this game. The course creator is way tooI have mixed feelings about this game.

On the other hand it makes me want to smash my gamepad.I like how you can create Mario levels with relative ease in this game. Of course if you want your levels to actually be how you want them to you've entered the real challenge in this game. The course creator is way too basic. I cant even count how many times I've had a great level idea only to find out it doesn't work. Not because there would be no way to do it but because I have no advanced options. I guess they have to make it easy to learn for all the ten year olds that play this game but it really makes me mad.Another thing I dislike about this game is how you can only upload so many levels. I understand why they limited it but for people like me who have no way of getting the word out and actually make decent levels it feels like I'm not being sold the full game. Unfortunately if you take away the limit you're left with even more terrible levels. You really have no way of winning. Maybe there should be a quality check where people can rate the levels but even that could be manipulated.This brings me to my next complaint. The terrible levels. So not only is the making part frustrating but the playing may be even worse. There are so many people who put no effort into their levels. They just get a bunch of enemies or just add a dev skip so they don't actually have to beat their level. I've played so many bad levels that I cant even think of anything clever to say about it.In conclusion this game is flawed. Very flawed. The fact that it is so expensive is even worse. But is it the worst game? No. Although it's definitely not one of the best things to ever come from Nintendo. Lets just hope that if they make a sequel they fix this.\
2015,Super Mario Maker,"A unique game that will have replayability years into the future, regardless of whether it is on the NX or not. Even if you never make a single course, there are many Mario games worth of excellent levels from Nintendo, famous designers, and ordinary people just like you. Nintendo will really have to one-up even excellent previous 2D Mario games in the future, because this is spectacular."
2015,Super Mario Maker,"How can you not like Mario maker? Unless you don't like Mario i don't see how you can dislike this game, this is easy to learn and play, i'm removing 1 point because there is still many thing i wish was in the game. I spent already 60 hours + i'm always making new level for my friend and it's alot of fun!"
2015,Super Mario Maker,"Very fun title to share your creations with friends, but this is not a complete Super Mario Bros creation tool, as it lacks a lot of the things and possibilities we see on the classic Super Mario games."
2015,Super Mario Maker,"A really fantastic game. Making levels is an amazing creative outlet, and even if you aren't feeling particularly creative, you still have hours and hours worth of other peoples levels you can play. It's also super fun that you can choose between several different styles of Mario, if you are into the older versions of Mario like I am."
2015,Super Mario Maker,Something is missing here\ Yes. This is the same Mario as always but my expectations are bigger. Should be something as a league. IM waiting for create whole worlds possibility etc.
2015,Super Mario Maker,"I love the presentation of the game and all the little details, such as the sounds objects make when you place them, or the fact that the music from saving the game on Mario Paint plays when you save a game here. It is a game which pleases both hard core Nintendo fans and casual gamers and that's fantastic. Only thing that scares me is whether Nintendo decide to take down levels I putI love the presentation of the game and all the little details, such as the sounds objects make when you place them, or the fact that the music from saving the game on Mario Paint plays when you save a game here.

Only thing that scares me is whether Nintendo decide to take down levels I put hours into making, for no reason at all.\"
2015,Super Mario Maker,"There are a few features I wish this game had to help improve on the aspects of designing your own levels. A lot of this changes based on the game style you choose, Original, Mario 3, World, Wii U. Wish it would mishmash more of these but it is a wonderful sandbox Mario making game. I highly recommend this game I suggest if you own a WiiU you go out and buy it."
2015,Super Mario Maker,"It is dishonest to say this game isn't perfect. Because there are no limitations. I see there being no way a 2D mario can pass this, unless they make a Super Mario Maker 2. You can create your own levels in 4 diff styles from Mario across the decades.

They probably wouldn't like this game because they are stupid and have low standards, probably barely know what a good video game looks like. I wish I was gay.\"
2015,Super Mario Maker,Must have for any Wii U owners. Very fun and easy to pick up but if you're looking a more immersive creative experience I would suggest LittleBigPlanet for PlayStation.

Is it the story? No. Is it the graphics? Sometimes. Is it the fun? Indeed.With this new game, every childs' dream becomes true- that is, if they've played a Mario game. In 2D. The construction tools that are avaible to the player are very big, allowing us to create new mechanisms and level ideas never seen before in Mario games, allowing innovation, something scarce in the recent sidescrolling games. The often debated 5 minute wait for items isn't a bad idea at all, as it allows players to adapt to the new elements avaible for building.However, there are some negative points too. The level searching system could be refined. Why can't we search by keywords, when every level has a title? It also pops to the eyes how the enemies move at 30 fps in the New style, and that they are sprites too. This isn't a bug inconvenience, however, as most levels are made in the 3 or world artsyle, because nostalgia.Thanks to its usful updates, such as the inclusion of checkpoints, SMM is a very solid game, with some edges that could have some improvements\"
2015,Super Mario Maker,Mario Maker is tolerable. Building levels is very fun for a month or two then you run out of ideas which leads to those bad Panga levels. I had an alright time with the game but it was nothing special for sure. But things were missing like slopes and other level biomes. Overall it's not a bad game but it's not great either.
2015,Super Mario Maker,"The last of Nintendo greatest ideas, give the players the tools the create the craziest levels ever made or sanest whatever you choose, haveing millions of levels to play everyday, and share yours its awesome, knowing someone else play yor level and lie it its very rexardingA Masterpiece indeed"
2015,Super Mario Maker,"This game deserved be released a lot of years behind, in same time of Little Big Planet.Ok, the possibilities if you compare this game with LBP are less, too much less. But the Mario universe helps this game, and you can enjoy all Mario games across the years.Awesome game, must buy"
2015,Super Mario Maker,"This is a must-have for Mario Lovers... Because who doesn't want to make their own level? But the game is not prefect. With all the content and the sandbox creativity they give you. The game still has it's flaws. Firstly, I never play other people's levels because most of the time it's one of those ""impossible"" levels which it's really hard to beat.

Firstly, I never play other people's levels because most of the time it's one of those ""impossible"" levels which it's really hard to beat. And I'm not complaining about those types of levels but there are way too much of these levels. Also there isn't everything you can put on your level, like the enemy spike, the squirrels and etc. They have some different enemies but they don't have all of the enemies.Also it's not limitless... there is a limit to how much stuff you can put on a level and it's gets annoying quite frankly. Because I'm a creative person and when I want to make interesting landscapes. I cannot because I'm limited to ""XX"" blocks....But otherwise. I love this game, it stays in my top 5 Wii U games for sure.\"

Super Mario world levels feel very similar to how they did on the SNES and New SMB levels feel as they did on the NSMB games previously release for the Wii and Wii U.Great game overall for those that are a fan of the side-scrolling Mario games and/or those who like to create things. Highly recommended.\"
