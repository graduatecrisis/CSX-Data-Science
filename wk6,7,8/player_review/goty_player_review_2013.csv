2013,GTA 5,"Absolutely amazing gameplay, story is great and gameplay in Los Santos last forever it seems and this is all in just single player, I can't wait for the online portion to come out. Great Game Rockstar!!! Worth every penny!!"
2013,GTA 5,"First of all, the main reason this game is getting over 100 negative user reviews is probably because of PC ""master racers"" who are pissed that for once the consoles got this GLORIOUS game before they did (to them, I say get over it; you'll get a half assed PC port soon enough that you can mod the living daylights out of eventually. Shut up and let us enjoy our 360s and PS3s for onceFirst of all, the main reason this game is getting over 100 negative user reviews is probably because of PC ""master racers"" who are pissed that for once the consoles got this GLORIOUS game before they did (to them, I say get over it; you'll get a half assed PC port soon enough that you can mod the living daylights out of eventually. Shut up and let us enjoy our 360s and PS3s for once without you  all over yourselves). That said, this is also one of the few times I'd give a game a perfect score: there is so much to do in this game, there is so much detail in this world and every single object in it (buildings, cars, people, the writing; it just goes on), and I've yet to find a single activity that I haven't enjoyed (aside from a slightly annoying GPS and menu system). Is for mature audiences? Yes. Is  used so often in conversation that white people are going to have to retrain themselves for when it's acceptable to use that word? OH yes. Is it also something that demands your respect, and that you can tell Rockstar poured their souls into making it as good as possible?  YES. And with GTA Online coming two weeks from the original release (and time of writing), I highly doubt that gamers are going to stop talking about this anytime soon.\"
2013,GTA 5,"Simply the best game on this generation. Its so much fun to play this game, it never gets boring and you can do everything and anything! Best GTA ever, and probably the best game ever.

2013,GTA 5,"This game is so freaking good. Its pathetic of some people to rate this game low because it's not on pc yet, basically they havent played it. I will get this game on pc if it makes its way onto it however it is not a reason to rate it low."
2013,GTA 5,"This game is just AMAZING! amazing storyline, Great missions, alot of things to do, it's muuuuch more better than GTA IV and even better than San Andreas, This game is what I was expecting and I'm sure this will be the game of the year"
2013,GTA 5,"After playing this game for 10 minutes i couldnt help but fondle my nuts. Me and ma boi Jow also known as hottdawg hit up da streetz itz da 1 tym. If you like Baldurs Gate: Dark Alliance, you will love this game. Fantastic local couch play with 1-4 players. Its nice to find another game in this genre combining the local co-op again. So much loot and monsters to kill; its never ending fun"
2013,GTA 5,"It is certainly the MOTHER OF ALL GAMES. The game of the century, that's until GTA 6 comes out but this is definitely the BEST game on earth.The graphics are amazing and the feel of the game play especially when driving is fantastic. There is so much detail about every small little thing! Rockstar have been making amazing games and this a BLOCKBUSTER."
2013,GTA 5,"This game is absolutely phenomenal. If you thought GTA IV was an amazing game, you'll think GTA V is an absolute masterpiece. The GTA world in this game is huge and never ending. I swear you could drive for hours and hours at a time and still have plenty of areas to explore. I have played GTA V for about 20 hours total and I have yet to even scratch the surface of this game."
2013,GTA 5,"This is a 10 rating to balance out the idiotic 0 star reviews from jealous PC users.  Go win some hats in TF2 and piss off with your unfair reviews.  Game gets a 10 obviously, best game of the year."
2013,GTA 5,Best game i ever played in my entire life! story is really amazing gameplay is straight out amazing there's not  is enough words that can describe on how amazing this game really is. i give it a 10/10 Best Game Of The Decade

2013,GTA 5,"If you're worried that this might be another over-hyped release of a sub-par product, coasting on the success of its big-name predecessors  as is all too common these days  you can rest easy: if you like any of the previous GTAs, you will love this. It has everything it should and more, taking the best elements of the core mechanics and plot from GTA 4 and re-adding (and improving further)If you're worried that this might be another over-hyped release of a sub-par product, coasting on the success of its big-name predecessors  as is all too common these days  you can rest easy: if you like any of the previous GTAs, you will love this. It has everything it should and more, taking the best elements of the core mechanics and plot from GTA 4 and re-adding (and improving further) the vast array of peripheral activities and huge non-linear world to get lost in.And if you're new to the series, this is a great game in its own right. At it's core, it's just really fun to play, whether you're driving around the countryside aimlessly or getting sucked into one of the many, varied plot strands.All of the mechanics and graphics have been polished to death. I actually can't imagine a game looking better on the Xbox, and the physics feel like a hyper-fun version of reality, which is exactly as it should be. It's super-accessible with just the right dash of realism to keep it grounded.There are too many features and improvements to describe in full here, but in a nutshell:- Really fun core mechanics.- Gorgeous, huge, painstakingly crafted world to explore- Absorbing plots and varied missions- Ridiculous number of sub-games, tasks and activities, woven seamlessly into the core game- Genuinely funny, satirical undertone to everythingAt time of posting this has a user score of 8.0, which is criminally low for a game which is about as good as I can imagine there being on the Xbox. Wanting a PC release because you know this is a good game is not a reason to give this 0/10 in the Xbox section, dummy.\"
2013,GTA 5,I have to say this game is amazing so far. Im about 8 missions into the game and the dialogue has had me laughing at every conversation. The map is outstanding as well. With so much to explore im definitely not going to be doing homework for a while. I would like to address the complaints about the fps rate and the texturesPeople we are playing on 7 year old hardware. Amazingly enoughI have to say this game is amazing so far.

With so much to explore im definitely not going to be doing homework for a while. I would like to address the complaints about the fps rate and the texturesPeople we are playing on 7 year old hardware. Amazingly enough the game isnt freezing on me with the outstanding graphics.Another thing is people complaining about it not being corely for the pc. Theres obviously a reason and its MONEY! Its basically a no brainer to core it for xbox and playstation. I dont blame them. I have a monster pc and i would personally rather play this on the xbox then pc. (my opinion)Overall this game is outstanding and i cant wait for the sleepless nights and skipped classes.10/10\
2013,GTA 5,"This is by far the best of all the GTAs. driving is smoother more responsive, shooting is somewhat improved the reticle could've been thought out a little more. I think the map should of been transparent and blown up in the top middle of the screen when driving, so you can focus on your driving. Awesome game."
2013,GTA 5,"First review and first time being on the site. It is really amazing how many immature babies are on here ""reviewing"" the game. No wonder PC players get a bad wrap when you have a small amount of ppl who act like complete kindergartners. I always hear how they are happy to be playing on PC because they don't have to deal with lil kids playing COD and screaming on the mics but wow you guysFirst review and first time being on the site.

I always hear how they are happy to be playing on PC because they don't have to deal with lil kids playing COD and screaming on the mics but wow you guys seem to act like the same lil kids. Giving the game a 0 because its not on PC yet lmao, how sad.Game deserves all the praise it gets. Easily the best GTA game Rockstar has made, they have improved in every way from GTA 4. The gunplay, the melee combat, the driving, THE WORLD. From jump you automatically see how much more beautiful and different Los Santos is from Liberty City. Still have so much more to play,.I'm giving it a 10/10 and we still have GTA Online in a few weeks. Could easily go up to 11.\"
2013,GTA 5,"I would like to make a few things clear about this game, If you see anyone on here that says ""THE GRAPHICS ARE TERRIBLE"" or ""THE LOAD TIMES OMG"" are just lying or have a ps3.  Im not bashing the ps3 but there has been a confirmed texture glitch on ps3.Ive only had to load a few times the whole time ive played the game once when I installed the game and once when you load your saves,I would like to make a few things clear about this game, If you see anyone on here that says ""THE GRAPHICS ARE TERRIBLE"" or ""THE LOAD TIMES OMG"" are just lying or have a ps3.  Im not bashing the ps3 but there has been a confirmed texture glitch on ps3.Ive only had to load a few times the whole time ive played the game once when I installed the game and once when you load your saves, there is NO LOAD TIMES BETWEEN, BEFORE OR AFTER CUTSCENES and who ever says that is lying about it. There are load times between character switching but the switching was faster than loading a mutiplayer map on an FPS.The city is bigger than liberty city it feels even bigger than the Orignal Los santos we say in gta san. If someone is telling you that the city is ""small"" and ""not as big as the other cities"" is lying to you. I know this because the first time I saw the map I thought the city looked small myself when I got there I clearly saw I was wrong.  Ive been playing for 10 hours now and I still havent seen all the city or even touched the wilderness areas.There isnt much to say about the graphics, there are a lot more effects and sun flares, the game looks better, the cars look better, everything just looks better.There are some bad things though...I did have a major frame rate drop while I was playing, It happened once but It was HORRIABLE, I dropped down to what felt like less than 10 frames for no reason what so ever. also if you look at the shadows too closely you can clearly see choppy and distorted shadows.Gameplay; The game play in this game feels....ok I guess, it isnt max payne which a lot of us were hoping for but it does get the job done, driving feels great.....shooting on the other hand just doesnt feel like it has the beefy impacts as gtaiv or max payne or even red dead have, but this doesnt effect scores since that is just a cosmetic effect.  Another problem I have about the game play is the specials each character gets; Micheal can slow down time while shooting max payne style, frank can slow down time while driving which also allows him to handle better and trevor can deal more damage while taking less., but the thing is Micheals just doesnt work or feel good it slows down time but it also slows you so much it doesnt even matter. Trevors is just hard to notice. But frank on the other hand feels good yet overpowered because of one thing, Frank can slow down time while in a car which means if hes doing drive bys he gets THE SAME EFFECT AS MICHEAL JUST IN A CAR! so basically frank gets two benefits while the others only get one.This game is not for everyone, If you dont like open worlds which have dense cities and open country sides you will not like this game, this game is a lot of driving and a lot of story which your average fps fan would not care for.   Me personally I love the game, I love its openness I love the look and its just nice to see a new gta game, It also *SLIGHT SPOILER*  has some pretty wacky moments that compare with saints row. but the thing is you have to know where to go to see these and you have to be willing to explore and find stuff your self and not be afraid of what might happen.A break down and final word: Graphics are nothing to worry about, Top notch graphics and only one major frame drop so far, which is great compared to other games this gen.Gameplay is fun but no real learning curve.Im giving it a 10/10 just because the things I mentioned are not game breaking what so ever,...Oh and one last thing, people complaining about draw distance and the roads need to remember  that the city is based off of LA, A city which does have 6 lane super highways and smog so dense you cant see the horizen. and heres a little tip....   The game DOESNT have poor draw distance, its literally the smog just like in real LA. this smog doesnt show up at night or in the country side, so anyone who is saying the game has  draw distance clearly has never been to LA or seen real pictures besides the ones we see on TV of a clear clean LA.  LA IS SMOGGY and the game shows it like that.\"

The story is EPIC, the gameplay is legendary, the missions are fun, and there is just so much innovation in this game. The Microtransactions are not the GREATEST idea in the world but at least it is not FORCED upon gamers unlike some games (EA). This game is going to force GAME COMPANIES to work a lot harder on their titles because NOW they have some serious competition! So take ALL of your previous GTA games and just sell them, throw them away or store them away becasue GTA V is all you need everyone! SO WHAT ARE YOU STILL DOING HERE??? BUY THIS GAME NOW!!!! 10/10!! And WHO HAS THE BALLS.... TO RATE THIS MASTERPIECE LOWER THAN A 10?? Oh and Saints Row IV... BEWARE!!\"
2013,GTA 5,"Amazing game! Anyone that says otherwise is clearly lying... Great game, lots to do, you'll never run out of stuff to do.Definitely getting it again for PS4, can't wait till GTA Online"
2013,GTA 5,Rockstar has done it again. I will definitely be buying all the DLC and playing this amazing game for months to come. I'm not sure why there are so many low reviews but I guess haters gotta hate
2013,GTA 5,"Is the GTA most comprehensive of all and the best yet, a video game made \\to dismiss this generation of consoles, the best game of this generation, a masterpiece."
2013,GTA 5,"Rockstar never fails to amaze it's fans.  The game is massive with a beautiful world to discover, pushing current gen consoles to their limit.  The story is action packed and not to mention you get to play as 3 characters.  Great game!"
2013,GTA 5,"The best game ever created, the city is perfect, it's as if the game continued even with the console off, I venture to say that this is the best game ever made, congratulations ROCKSTAR GAMESGOTY 2013"
2013,GTA 5,"Wow best game everRockstar Game's best release ever  It has a great narrative, tight gameplay and a fantastic soundtrack. It's everything you could want from a Rockstar game and more! Game of the year and quite possibly the game of this generation"
2013,GTA 5,"""pc""   holes. I've got to say I've been enjoying every single piece of GTA 5 so far. Radios take me back, once I found Groove Street I could guide myself through the entire city and the new mechanics are amazingly improved comparing to GTA IV which in my opinion was really overrated."
2013,GTA 5,"Absolutely amazing game in every way. The fact that the game runs so smoothly on decade-old consoles is insane. Amazing graphics, great gameplay, improved driving, tons more to do compared to GTA IV.Everything is simply better."
2013,GTA 5,"what? 8,1 user score? All this trolls and haters can't do nothing with this masterpiece. Best Grand Theft Auto ever, even better than San Andreas, so what are you waiting for?"
2013,GTA 5,this game is not only perfect its a revolotion in open world game because los santos is massive and on its Every pixel have a surprise for you  thank you rockstar
2013,GTA 5,"The definitive GTA release thus far. If you liked the prior GTA titles in the past, you need this game in your PS3 or 360. The flight model and driving physics are rock solid. The story based missions are the best seen in an open world game. R* have really raised the bar. Buy it."
2013,GTA 5,"The best GTA game so far. From going underwater to starting a business to endless pedestrian killing, this game never loses fun and is a legend in sandbox gaming."
2013,GTA 5,Incredible game in a lot of ways. I have never seen a so deep game  Wonderful job from one of the very best game producer of History.... Thanks Rockstar
2013,GTA 5,"The transmission between the characters is well made, the city and the surroundings look absolutely stunning, the story line is compelling. Gta V simply is one amazing game!"
2013,GTA 5,"I play every game that comes out for xbox 360 including the (IN MY OPINION) terrible terrible GTA iv. this game is hilarious and has much better controlls then gta iv it runs like 100x smoother aswell no blurring haha. before this game came out i really didnt think it was going to beable to live up to all the hype, well, it did."
2013,GTA 5,"Unbelievable! the map is enormous, there are tons of new, fun things to do, and so far I am very impressed by the storyline. Rockstar hit another one out of the park with this game.P.S. the radio is awesome. there are something like 1000 tracks and as always the talk shows are hilarious."
2013,GTA 5,"Well, the time has finally come. After 5 years of waiting, we finally have the game we've all been waiting for.Grand Theft Auto has only been released today but it's got the whole world paying attention.After the minimal GTA IV, everyone has been eager for the next instalment to match up with GTA: San Andreas. The freedom that was available in San Andreas stayed in everyone's heartsWell, the time has finally come. After 5 years of waiting, we finally have the game we've all been waiting for.Grand Theft Auto has only been released today but it's got the whole world paying attention.After the minimal GTA IV, everyone has been eager for the next instalment to match up with GTA: San Andreas. The freedom that was available in San Andreas stayed in everyone's hearts and minds for all these years, and now it's back with style!The world is massive. When I say massive, I mean massive!There were a lot of complaints from people when the map was leaked, saying that Los Santos is tiny and they were hoping for more. When you actually enter the world though, you finally see the epic scale of what Rockstar have created.Once you're on the road and doing your thing, the size doesn't even cross your mind because you're so involved with the game. Busting down roads in a sports car you've just stolen going at top speed still doesn't cover the map in any short time. That's not to mention Blaine County! The area is so huge and has so much to do there, you find yourself staying in the dirt county and enjoying the views and all the activities there is to do. It's great because Los Santos and Blaine County feel like totally different worlds, but you get to enjoy them in one solid game.I really enjoyed GTA: IV, because it felt fresh on the now current gen platforms. I always saw mixed reviews about the driving, but honestly, I loved it. It did take some time to adjust to the smooth, but loose handling of the cars, but after that it was just a barrel of fun.To be honest though, I am glad that they have changed the mechanics of the handling on GTA V.With the area been so big and varied, the sharper handling certainly does help out in some sticky situations. It's almost like they blended GTA: San Andreas & GTA: IV's handling and created something special. Sometimes it can feel like the handling is harsh, but once you get the hang of it, it certainly is something beautiful. Especially when you are on a mission and you have the police on your tail. This is where you get high end chases and everything flows perfect.So far I am really enjoying the story. It really feels like I'm in a interactive movie.The scripting is done hilariously well. You want to know what the stories about and how they are going to come out on top. It really is great to see a well scripted story, but also a game that is so open and inviting, you feel drawn in and want to stay there. One minute you could be pulling off a major heist and the next you're riding your bike along the beach front watching the sun set.The gun play has greatly improved. If you are familiar with GTA: IV's controls for shooting then you'll be right at home here. It's a great mix of GTA and Max Payne 3, especially when you control Michael, as his special ability is slow motion. Yup, you read that right, each of the 3 characters has their own special ability. Michael has his slow motion for gun fights, Franklin has his slow motion focus with vehicles, which is great for getaways! And Trevor, who has a wicked rage ability. He inflicts extra damage on people, literally blowing their heads off! His damage is also reduced which really does help when you're in a rampage mood.There really is a enormous amount of content in this game. Something which is going to be absolutely amazing when GTA: Online is released on the 1st October.If you're looking for a new open world game to play, that offers the most amount of content you've ever seen (And that's not including GTA: Online), and you're looking for a fun story that draws you in to what's going on in the world, then Grand Theft Auto V is the game for you.The unpredictable world really has so much to offer. You could be planning to do one thing and then something pops up along the way and while you're doing that, something else starts to happen. It all feels organic. You don't feel like you're forcing yourself to do anything. You just kick back and let the game entertain you.I definitely urge any long time fan of the GTA series, or anyone who loves their open world/action games, hell, even sports games, to give this a go.The amount of content and things to do is enough to keep everyone interested for a long time.This game will be getting a 10/10 from me! The fact it made me want to write my very first review, shows me this game is special. I'm anxiously waiting to finish work so I can go and enjoy the world of Grand Theft Auto V, again!I hope everyone enjoyed my short review, or at the very least found the information helpful!Until next time!MarcUBGaming\"

2013,GTA 5,Grand Theft Auto 5 exceeds the boundaries of the outdated current gen consoles that allows for one of the most alive open worlds ever created in the history of gaming.

There is so much to see and do in this living world rockstar has created. Only flaws I've seen are a bit of pop in and very few glitches. It is extremely polished and was well worth the wait. It's games like these that set the bar infinitely high for open world games and proves that rockstar is the king of open world games. It's gonna be hard to beat this game out...even next gen games don't stand a chance against the masterpiece that is gta 5.\"

2013,GTA 5,"This game is the culmination of a lot of previous Rockstar games. In this game I can see aspects from GTA  III and IV, as well as Red Dead Redemption and Max Payne 3. To describe the game in one word: Extraordinary  definitely the game of this generation.The sheer amount of detail in the vast world that you can explore freely is quite simply astounding, with so much to do that youThis game is the culmination of a lot of previous Rockstar games. In this game I can see aspects from GTA  III and IV, as well as Red Dead Redemption and Max Payne 3. To describe the game in one word: Extraordinary  definitely the game of this generation.The sheer amount of detail in the vast world that you can explore freely is quite simply astounding, with so much to do that you cannot get bored. I'm not sure how they have managed to squeeze this much out of 7-8 year old hardware, I didn't think it was possible. I'm not sure how this game got the same score as IV, because in my opinion this is a superior game. The three protagonist switching feature is awesome, car handling is better, the graphical fidelity is better, the cover mode in combat is better, the missions are more varied, the characters and storyline is better and finally, there is more to do after the missions have been completed.The only minor complaint I have is the heists. I feel they could have gone further with them. When I had finished them, I was left wanting more  although you can replay them over (and over and over and over and over) again at any time, along with any previous mission.The game does push its luck, especially with the torture scene, but it is Grand Theft Auto, remember. Fans of the series probably won't be shocked by it  it's what we've come to expect in this franchise, and we love it.To sum up: Rockstar's best game ever, the best XBOX 360/Playstation 3 game ever, the best game in this generation, and one of the best games of all time on any platform  simply brilliant! 10 out of 10 all the way.\"

2013,GTA 5,"Ignore the dumbass PC haters, keep in mind the only bad ratings are because a) cowards who can't take the excessive violence and b) pc gaming master  (I love pc but this is crossing the line) who are jelous and want a pc port (I do to) GTA IV is nothing compared to this."

You will be hooked for months on end. The story absolutely beats the stories of the previous installments, including GTA IV (along with its DLCs) and San Andreas. The story is deep and extremely fun to play. Customization has been improved greatly, with customizable cars, tatoos, and players in GTA Online. Speaking of Online, this game has all of the great modes from GTA IV, along with a much deeper and fun experience in free mode.Overall, this game is the best GTA game ever, rockstar's best game ever, Xbox 360s best game ever, one of the best games from this generation, and even one of the best games ever made.

Seriously, you notice these. It doesn't happen often though, so don't worry. Car driving is improved over GTA IV, cars drive smooth. Character switching is also smooth, sometimes when switching characters you'll notice them doing something else. I once switched to Trevor, and... find that out for yourself.\"

GTA V has amazing Graphics, Great story (But had some parts that should have been improved), Great open world, Awesome that they finally added ""Busted, Wasted, Mission Passed"", And the Character Trevor, Trevor is basically like Joe Pesci from Casino, you know the one where he stabs the guy with a pen, Trevor is almost just like that, But my favourite thing in game is MR TANK IS BACK, yeah GTA IV didn't have a tank neither did TLAD however TBOGT did but the tank was disapointing But GTA V finally listened to me and gave nearly everything in GTA V that I wanted, NEARLY that's there is a reason I didn't give GTA V a 10/10, so now let's move on to the game's weak spots.1. FranklinI hate this character the first mission that I played with him, that's where i started to hate him, he's bossy, he's boring, he's bland and uninteresting and he could the worst character since Roman Belic, I didn't give a  about him or his gang. The fact that he's a main character is just, it's not smart.2. What game is this ?When I played the first 4 hrs of this i didn't know what i was playing, It's because GTA V feels like 4 GAMES smashed into one. For example the new activities such as hunting, I mean i've seen that in Assassin's Creed 3, Far Cry 3 and Tomb Raider, and all those games did it better than V, the shooting resembles Max Payne 3 is GTA trying to compete against Max Payne  WTF. Then there is an attempt to out do Max Payne even moar by having slowdown time in V, Slowmotion in GTA is strange could have been good if it was done right but I don't know. Then GTA V starts to rip off Midnight Club by having the same style.3. Nothing NewThere is lack of novelty in V and what do i MEAN by that well, GTA 3 When it came out it was so new because of the 3D open world and it was so revolutionary Then Vice City comes out and the new things was that the main character could actually speak and you could relate to him. San Andreas Comes out and bunch of newer things were in it like the gameplay was improved and moar customization was in it. GTA IV had NOTHING new to bring to the table and that's why it sucks. Now GTA V comes out there is nothing new ok maybe the graphics and that you have dogs in it  And then someone might say, oh but it has multiplayer, yeah that's not new that was already in previous GTA'S, and some other  might say: You can play as three different characters. Yeah Well guess what in GTA 1 you had a choice of like 5 different characters to play as, not new. So I don't see why this game has a higher score than GTA 3, GTA VC and GTA SA.So I'll finish this review by saying that overall GTA V has great/ Very good things in it but come on did you really think this would be a better game than 3, VC or SA, nope definetely not.+ Graphics+ Fun Multiplayer+ Tank is back- FranklinGTA V deserves an 8/10.\"

Kudos"
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"Gameplay will never change. There is this mass illusion in the game industry that each game has mechanics slightly more polished than its predecessors. While you can tweak it a bit, the shooter formula has reached its apex, and while Bioshock Infinite does improve superficially on both the vigors and the guns, especially in the latter category (gunfire and recoil more realistic), it's really what it doesn't do that the game needed more of. Some have complained about the lack of RPG elements (with the exception of gun and vigor upgrades), such as inventory or map screen. I found this to be a huge improvement. There is no menu interaction to slow the pacing and you're always on the move. I thought the tone of the game world would have felt more immersive with the lack of a HUD, much like the first gameplay demo Irrational Games released several years ago. But all of the above are personal opinions and design choices. What left a sour taste in my mouth wasn't anything you can experience in the game itself. No, you could only experience this bittersweet regret if you had watched, in eager anticipation, all of Ken Levine's interviews, only to realize you had just witnessed the biggest cop out in gaming history.Expectation #1: An actual floating city, complete with physics.After the first demo that was released (which is never shown in the game), we see one of the massive, orange balloons tethered to the corner of a belltower deflate suddenly and the massive structure starts to pivot towards the ground, the bell flying loose from its moorings only to come grinding to a stop inches away from your feet, the cobblestones buckling under its weight and shooting off in every direction. Later, Ken Levine commented on the instablity of the city, how the tech team had made it pulse with life, and hinted that you'd be able to topple the city around you. This fell short on both accounts, the only undulating architecture in the game appearing during the first half, and after you're solidly captivated by the world, these stellar sights give way to more mundane gameplay (street shootouts and interior combat). It never feels like their main selling point is really taken to its full potential.Expectation #2: Watch the city tear itself apart (pre-Rapture)This is the big one. I want to be as harsh as possible when I say that this was a blatant lie. We were supposedly going to 'watch the city fall apart before us'. We were told that there would be moments where you would have to interact with citizens on the street, such as pointing a gun at a potential mugger to send him scrambling, or intervening in a local execution (both of which are shown in the same demo). There are maybe three moments in the entire game where you feel this sort of weight behind your actions, and they are as superfluous as they are dull. You can't change the overall outcome of anything, although watching the colorful, Independence Day style utopia burn slowly is captivating in its own way. I would have preferred a little more interaction, hence replayability.Expectation #3: A decent resolution.This one is debatable. And the main reason for the spoilers tag. Let's get the big one out of the way, the resolutions to each storyline. Both Daisy Fitzroy and Jeremiah Fink are shadowbox characters that bleed out of the story as quickly as they pop in. Slate is one of the more interesting characters but doesn't feel fully fleshed out. Don't get me started on Comstock. Let's face it, time travel was both the protagonist and antagonist here. It solves everything (most levels are going back and forth through the area in different time periods), and also helps ease along the ruthlessly shoehorned ending. But despite all of this, the ending was emotional and relatively significant enough to make it feel as if it 'belonged'. It was the gamer in me that made me want to slap Ken Levine. Songbird becomes your best bud and then you get to watch him drown in two seconds. Apparently the Bioshock story will never change because even with its fairly restricted narrative parameters, it's the doorway to infinite worlds just like it with new coats of paint (so we can expect this disappointment forever). Oh, and my personal favorite: The final boss is three waves of the easiest enemies in the game. No Handyman. No Songbird. Fail.But aside from all the things they promised and didn't deliver, this is a bittersweet shooter, with some amazingly satisfying gameplay regarding the vigors and gunplay, but some equally frustrating inconsistencies in the pacing and storyline. Oh, and this game tries desperately to emulate Disney (and doesn't do a bad job), but it's so obvious in parts it's almost painful, especially if you're like me and find the overall 'girl in a tower' concept a little overused and cheesy.Still, if you're a fan of shooters or Bioshock in general, you owe it to yourself to see how far the series has come.\"

The city of Columbia was built with passion and care. The art STYLING is brilliant. Likewise the main characters are sublime. Certain set-pieces are BRILLIANT. Yet finally this game does not stand up as a product that is worth $60. It is far too short and the shooting/exploring elements are far too limited, a kind of theatrical filler between the numerous set-pieces of this scenic railroad. Good though it is, this is a game to wait for. Wait till the hype blows over and get it when it hits its true value of around $20. The combat is fun but not challenging. Enemy AI is weak. The game is also far too linear and NARROW in terms of both player progress and narrative. The game finally exposes its true weaknesses, after many great moments when the plot falls to pieces at the end with one of the most head-scratching (in a negative sense) and RIDICULOUS conclusions you will ever see in a game. The ending is not deep. It is not a philosphical marvel. It's an incoherent mess that will have you wondering what the team at Irrational Games have been smoking for the last FIVE YEARS. While the anti-American Exceptionism is fairly amusing is is also over-played. Doesn't Ken Levine understand the word subtlety? Bioware Infinite is definitely a game to be enjoyed when the price comes down. I understand the desire of users to praose any game to the heavens. It happened also with Skyrim, which simply was also not very good. Keep waiting boys and girls, a true 10/10 game will get made eventually. Enough dudes are working at it.\"

Bioshock Infinite is my favorite game to date, no question about it.To start, the art direction is very good. Everything is arranged to be very appealing, and the colors are very balanced. I loved just walking around the city and soaking it all up. There are 1912 style shops to go into, and they are all populated. In one area, there is even a good, three-minute quartet that you can just sit and listen to. I was very impressed with the magnitude of everything. Seldom are you placed in a small, dark room or hallway. Most of the game is set in colorful areas with large statues and airy buildings.I liked that it didn't actually put you in the dark, but gave a dark feeling when it was appropriate. As per the Bioshock games, some of the events are quite dark-- and I liked the uneasy feeling without the dark corridors of Rapture.Combat is a step up from other games in the genre. The introduction of ""skylines"" allows you to jump quickly from place to place, making everything very fast paced. I didn't quite like the inventory management as much as in the original Bioshock, however. I found it much harder to deal with my Vigors, mainly because you couldn't just scroll through them like in the other game. Still, you get used to it-- that's a fairly minor gripe.I can't really say much about the story. If I told you what was so great about it, I'd spoil it for you. I can say that it puzzled me, and it was a few hours after finishing the game that I worked everything out. I felt like some of the points were repeated too much though. I get that they try to help everyone understand it well, but I'd rather just have it all thrown at me-- that way it's more fun to work out on my own.Overall, Irrational Games has gone above and beyond what anyone expected. The only way you'd find this game worse than the original is if you're somewhat nostalgic. Even if you didn't like the first or second game, I really suggest that you still give Bioshock Infinite a try. As a side note, there are a few things that you won't quite understand if you skip the first game. They are little details, but in a game like Bioshock Infinite, it's those little details that really count.This game is worth every cent. If you can't afford it, you can get it off the grey market for an earbud or so (about $35).\"
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"Awesome game! Cool graphic design and perfect soundtrack. Love it very much. Action is very dynamic and the story is interesting so far.

The developers took a lot of big risks in this game, with a lot of decisions that could have easily backfired and ruined the whole experience. The fact that everything works so well together is remarkable in its own right. I think calling it ""The greatest game of all time"" like some other reviewers are is kind of a stretch, but certainly I don't think anything else coming out this year will even approach the quality of Bioshock Infinite. If you liked the first Bioshock, you probably already have this game, but if you don't you owe it to yourself to get this. If you felt that the gameplay was dull in the original Bioshock or that that lack of subtlety in dealing with broader philosophical and political concepts was problematic, you're going to find the same issues here.

With the physics engines and graphics cards of 2013, Infinite leaves us thinking ""Damn, if only Rapture had looked this good.""If anything could be said against the game, it would be Irrational's lack of effort towards creating a fully function AI society. Whilst the player is indeed submerged in a city with non-aggressive AI to bolster the feeling that you are in a real human settlement and not just a war zone, Irrational struggles to do this improvement over the game's predecessors any real justice with the lack of interaction between the AI and the player itself. One finds themself questioning the difference between taking stuff from a chest of drawers and taking stuff from a chest of drawers with the word 'steal' at the bottom of the screen, demonstrating the scripted incidents carried out by the competely robotic artificial intelligence.\"

Seriously, some of the stuff in these comments is ridiculous. The setting is ""unimaginative""? What? How can you complain about a steampunk, floating city being ""unimaginative"" when there are games like Call of Duty and Battlefield getting farted out that use a brown, dust filled desert-industrial environment which seems to be a sort of basic formula for games nowadays. Anyway, the setting IS imaginative, and the story IS good, anybody who is saying the story ""made no sense"" probably just didn't understand it because they have the IQ of a coconut. The story made sense perfectly fine to me, and to 98% of the other people who played the game, as well. That said, if you don't like exploring, and just prefer to shoot people, don't buy this game and then complain that it was too well paced and you didn't spend 100% of your time killing other humans, because there is a big emphasis on exploration in this game, gear, money, and voxophones, which flesh out the story really nicely are all found by exploration. Also you get to see more of the city and experience the graphics design, because it is spectacular. Basically, it has everything good that the first Bioshock had, fast paced and exciting combat, amazing, albeit very different, atmosphere, an emphasis on exploration and a great story, without the redundant binary moral choice system. Also Elizabeth is a really nice addition to the game, one of the best support characters since Alyx.Basically, if you haven't played it, and are here to write a bad review because you watched TotalBiscuit's WTF is? video, then go away. If you DID play it, and didn't enjoy it, fair enough, but don't criticise something simply because of its genre. Yes, it didn't have any puzzles or stealth. Do you know why? Because it's an FPS, you moron.  Anyway, if you enjoyed the original, you'll love this, it's definitely a Bioshock game, I'd say it was even better than the 1st.  The worst thing about it was the soundtrack, and that's just because I can't remember anything about it, and I finished the game yesterday. Great combat, great story, great atmosphere, great pacing, great graphics, it did everything well. I'm giving it a 9 because of a few things I didn't like. The vigors are a bit unoriginal, except for the Bucking Bronco and Murder of Crows, and even that is basically just a repackaged Insect Swarm from B1. I preferred the gun upgrade system in B1, and the upgrades for that were much more original than the ones in this, which pretty much consist of ""damage increase"", ""clip size increase"", ""recoil decrease"", and ""accuracy increase"". It's a fantastic game, but there ARE a few things that stop it from being a 10. I would give it 9.5 if I could, but there is no 9.5,  so it gets a 9. I loved it, and will definitely buy the DLC planned.\"

However, once you get that out of the way, it's a much better version of it than the previous two.  For example, while combat is still the same setup (replace plasmid with vigor) and enemies still can feel a little bullet-spongy (I recommend turning off health meters in the options menu, as well as most other HUD notifications), most encounters take place in these big open areas that are also densely packed with cool tactical options.  The result is some thrilling and crazy combat moments that in most games would be heavily scripted.  No more ""electrocute-wrench"" through the whole game.  Graphically, you can sometimes see some flat textures up close reminding you that this is a game that has been worked on for 6 years, but on the whole it is quite gorgeous.  Nice to play an FPS that doesn't look like a brown and grey modern military shooter or a future space war that might as well  be a military shooter for how it looks.On that note, this game has the best storytelling since Half-Life 2.  No sitting through pre-rendered cutscenes full of people spewing exposition at you.  Just exploring the environment explains what's going on in the world and hints at some weird stuff behind the surface.  This game also deals with racism and religious fundamentalism in a far less heavy handed manner than you would expect.  Nice to play a game that doesn't treat you like a moron who can't follow a simple story.So in summary: Yes, if you go into this game expecting it to be the industry-changing miracle some people are making it out to be, you will be let down.  But if you go in expecting an FPS that is far more immersive, original and entertaining than 95% of what you've played in the last few years, you'll get it.  Hell, it's basically a 10-hour escort mission with a character you still care about by the end and never get annoyed with.  That alone deserves some kudos.\"

And now I get to play one of the best games of this generation. When you first step into Columbia it feels like the first time at a theme park, the atmosphere is something no hardcore or casual gamer should miss out on. The combat has improved since the first game, using the Skyline is a great addition to the combat and of course getting around. Elizabeth is a character you want around you, and never gets in your way or does annoying things to hinder combat (take note Capcom). I haven't finished the game yet, but to me its a game you don't want to ever end, the experience is that good! I understand certain people won't like this game, every game in existence has players that won't like it, but come on, people who give 0's to a game like this is just trolling! @ciuchina82 How is multiplayer a joke? There is no multiplayer! and to allow your son of 4 years old to play this then I review your parenting a 0/10.\"

Points deducted for repetitive combat and repetitive enemies. The powers are not very inspired and have a simplistic ""fire at enemy or lay a trap"". The game stutters when loading new areas even with solid 60fps (gtx 570, settings on med/high) and thus breaks the immersion. You can only carry two guns which is disappointing and I pretty much went the entire game with raven power, shock power, sniper rifle and machine gun. I very rarely changed tactics and progressed easily with this setup. Was also dissapointed to find med kits had been removed and you cannot carry additional salts to power up your abilities when running low (have to rely on Elizabeth or the surrounding area). Was a good solid game, however the original Bioshock is still my favourite.\"

This game, however, already has those.  As a preface, to truly appreciate this game I think you have to enjoy story telling.  This game is HEAVILY story driven with fantastic writing.  I spent at least an hour in the chapel after landing in Columbia.  Needless to say I have not finished the game  yet  but I am savoring it.  I am playing on hard as suggested by PC Gamer  because most story centric games have little replay value  but this game's story is deep and rich enough to deserve at least another replay.  I know I will replay it with the 1999 option after hard so that I can see how I might end without a winnable ending.  This is a game about the journey.  To rush through it is to completely miss the substance of the game.  This is not an ADD friendly game.  While the combat is exhilarating and amazingly fun (much like but improved over the original Bioshock) you do have to use tactics and planning to survive.  I also appreciate that on the non-1999 version you are not overly punished for screwing up and experimenting.  The voice acting, the graphics, the atmosphere, the sheer creative genius of this world inspired me to buy a season pass as I would love more of this game.  Ken Levine and the entire Irrational Games team should be given a well deserved standing ovation.  I hope that Irrational will take their time, but not as much time, developing their next game.  A return to a cyberpunk world would be wonderful, perhaps as a System Shock 3?  Take a well deserved break Mr. Levine  come back refreshed and let that genius flow again into yet another wonderful experience.\"

Other than that, the atmosphere, the sound score, the gun play, the vigor play, the connection gameplay wise with Elizabeth, the story, the aesthetics and graphics (other than texture work) are all top of the line.Until now I thought Tomb Raider would run with the game of the year title, it is a contender, but I have a slight feeling that this will run with it.

But that's ok.Music is just mind blowing. Literally mind blowing.Elizabeth and here gossips are epic.

This is Bioshock rehashed but without heart and full of hate hidden throughout the world. To those who missed the first Bioshock then I understand why you think this is a masterpiece. There is a reason why originals hold their place in our hearts compared to sequels. Nothing Irrational Games does will capture the heart of Rapture again!

Gone is the atmosphere of tension, solitude and slow, cloying fear, of being a rat in an alien maze, desperately fighting the machinations of a near-ubiquitously powerful, intelligent enemy who hates you more than anything else. Gone is the rapidly blurring dichotomy of you and the warped genetic monstrosities you fight against. Gone is the sprawling, labyrinthine level-design that made you feel a stranger in an even stranger land.Instead, brightly coloured setpieces tower above poor-quality environmental textures plagued by pop-in effects and graphical errors. All pretensions of atmosphere disappear in a neo-Americana hell, populated by  a number of identical racist caricatures whose threat towards you is as laughable as their suicidal and stupid combat AI. What tropes of old remain, like the strange powers you and an illogically small proportion of NPC's possess, the garish, loudly coloured vending machines, are not given even the merest pretensions of logical existence in a world that remains true to the 'Shock series in barely more than name alone.The satisfying gunplay of Bioshock is replaced with something that seems two steps back  guns feel like they lack weight and impact, melee combat has gone from having some of the most visceral and brutal force to an insufficient, chaotic slugfest. Each blow of the wrench in Bioshock 1 felt like the fist of an angry God compared to the mess that is Infinite's hand to hand combat. Weapon upgrades feel tacked on, (gone are the tactical uses for each weapon: You will rarely require to change between two.) lacking the incredibly unique feeling and game-changing add-ones of Bioshock that added striking visual components to your weaponry.Gunplay itself is almost parodic  your limited selection of weapons, when the gimmicky or inferior are pared away, leave you to fight against generic waves of identical enemies with your iron sights and  in what feels like a near slap in the face, _regenerating shields._Plasmids (or 'vigours') feel similarly superfluous, despite an obvious attempt to broad the range of options both between and within them. Their use feels as unsatisfying and generic as the gimmicks of many other mid-quality FPS offerings that the Shock pedigree should stand above. Environmental uses for vigours are easily missed and of limited use. Contrast the feel of the fire power in Bioshock and Bioshock Infinite. In the former, a click of the fingers instantly set an enemy ablaze. It was fast, punishing and conveyed the utter power of ADAM, at the expense of your own body. It was a standard fallback for many players for good reason, for it was ubiquitously useful, but not overpowering. In the darkness of Rapture, the flames you ignited with a snap of your fingers were immediate reminders of power.In Infinite, the clunky, slow moving projectile feels more like a grenade. Enemies who rush at you wildly in chaotic, rarely tactical combat make efficient use of the power difficult, and the flames themselves seem ineffectual, difficult to use when other powers are simpler and easier to use. Environmental uses like conveniently placed oil-slicks are rarely of any real value. The use of almost any vigour seems a waste of resources. Unsatisfying, unrewarding, unpolished.The story itself is a decidedly average mess, riddled with plot holes and uncompelling characters. Your constant companion is, while relatively likeable and useful, not something I expected from a franchise that made it's name on the back of well-crafted atmospheric tension.Gone too are some of the rewarding RPG elements, replaced by a bizarre 'gear' system that seems more at home in a Borderlands game than Bioshock. Not a few hours into the game and you are furnished with a pair of trousers that allow you to punch people from three-times the distance away, (often launching you off the edge of the city to an untimely, undeserved death) or another item of clothing that inexplicably causes opponents you strike in melee to spontaneously burst into flames and burn to skeletons before your eyes. A hat it was, I think. What were they thinking?!This is of course rhetorical. It is obvious what they were thinking. A combination of changing appeal to a casual audience and rushed production values, Infinite is the death-knell of the 'Shock series. What's worse is that the this same audience of 'gamers', too captivated by their understanding of (actually visually average, but disguised by gross amounts of bloom and fog) setpieces that the developer literally drags your attention to as 'good graphics', (which is what a good game is all about, right?) who purchase an identical Call of Duty game EVERY year, are lapping titles like Infinite up.Rest In Peace.

Frankly, most of the elements that were unique to BioShock have been utterly stripped from this title. There's still plasmids (Vigors) and a steampunk setting but that is where the similarities cease. The hacking elements are gone,  lockpicking is taken away from the player and given to an AI, the research camera is removed, and paying attention to health has been replaced with the all-too-generic ""regenerating health"" mechanic. BioShock's ""Big Daddies"" are replaced with ""Handymen"" who are seen far too infrequently, and ""Motorized Patriots"" which are overused. The vast majority of the enemy AI are merely footsolders who are easy to defeat (and completely stupid) even on the hardest setting. The shooting mechanics have never been particularly strong in the BioShock franchise but BioShock Infinite strips it down further, allowing players to carry only two weapons at any given time like any other stock FPS title. In addition, the vigor powers themselves are lackluster and chances are you'll go through the entire game running with Possession (the hacking ""replacement"") and Bucking Bronco or Murder of Crows (the two Vigors which have the most effect on enemy mobs  loss of control and stun+damage, respectively). We get Vigor powers like ""Shock Jockey"" (the name should tell you what it does) and the game points out how we can use it to power up devices  but then we only get one particular device to use it on and little reason to use it again. So this leaves us with the story which seems to be getting the most praise. However, the story itself is a series of walking cliches and tropes about multiverse theory and time-space manipulation and, frankly, has been addressed better elsewhere in countless science fiction novels, movies, TV shows, and even comic books. When the game explains the concepts of ""constants and variables"" in the multiverse it feels more like they're attempting to justify why the game took such a hard 90 degree turn away from previous gameplay demos in order to proffer this metaphysical theme. Where, for example, is the Elizabeth AI we were shown where she fought along side of us? Gone and replaced with a cowering AI that gets in the way and offers little help but tossing us items from time to time. Where, for example, were the critical moments in the game shown during gameplay demos of E3's past? Gone and replaced with overly cerebral tropes about quantum mechanics and multiple realities. Where, for example, are all the examples of how the sky-rail plays a critical role in the game? Just gone, entirely. Don't get me wrong, the story is heads and shoulders better than MOST games these days and the attention to detail is second to none. For those reasons alone the game should be experienced at least once. It's just the story isn't nearly as new OR earth shattering as many claim it to be and, if I didn't care about spoilers, I could point out how Infinite almost perfectly parallels the story of Walter and Peter Bishop from the TV show Fringe. While the story is better than most it really doesn't make the shortcomings of the gameplay easier to bear. Finally, for a game which was designed exclusively for single player, the game is very short, clocking in at a total of 14 hours on the hard difficulty setting with most of the collectibles obtained. Given the fact that many elements were chopped out of the gameplay videos, I can't help but wonder how much is sitting on the cutting room floor, or if key parts were stripped in order to push out fast DLC. There's no reason this game shouldn't have been AT LEAST 20 hours in length, especially given how linear it is designed. All in all, it's a decent game but painfully average in terms of gameplay and only barely above average in terms of story. Levine spent so much time on the metaphysical that it feels like he and the development team forgot that it was all of the elements, combined, that made BioShock so distinct and enjoyable. It's worth playing at least once to soak in all the wonder but, sadly, you won't really be going back to play it again since nothing (except difficulty) changes between play throughs.\"

Gameplay hours ran me about 6 hours in total. In terms of gameplay itself the only unique thing about it was the skyline which was fun to use. The rest of the game itself just didn't feel that great. Looking out in the distance and looking at the view and the world that they created was awesome. One thing to expect is repetitive gameplay. You will find all the missions to be the same. You will be running from map to map running and gunning. There were no unique quests. Even after finishing I felt as if it was extremely liner and have no desire to return to this game. The only thing this game has for it was its super awesome voice acting and its stunning visuals. The skyline added a very unique system but it was a bit disappointing. All in all I gotta rate this game a 6.5/10. Due to the weird plot twists, uninteresting enemies, repetitive gameplay. If this game would improve its maps. Making everything more like its original. This game would easily make my top of the list. It all came down to its average gameplay and linear story. The game was incredibly easy.

I am genuinely confused by the gushing reviews of ""perfection"" this and ""masterpiece"" that.It was a constant race toward the reason to switch it off. Between the boredom and the motion sickness caused by the poor mouse sensitivity settings, i got no enjoyment from this title at all. The motion sickness piped it in the end and i gladly quit after only a few hours ....probably forever.For goodness sake play a demo! I guess this game is love it or hate it. P.S.

The same is true for sprint and crouch. Where is the customization? It's a crime this feature was left out of the PC port.2. Forced to edit .ini files. The mouse aiming is atrocious on default. It wasn't until I read that mouse smoothing and auto-aim was enabled by default that I was able to fix this problem. Again, there are no settings in game to toggle these. You have to dig around in .ini file to turn them off manually. 3. You can only carry 2 guns. The hell? Who thought this was a good idea? In both prior incarnations of the game you had the freedom to choose any gun available for the situation. Now you are pigeon holed. Decreasing the amount of choice in a game is simply bad design.4. Bloom and DOF covers up incredibly low poly-count models, extreme polygon warping in many animations due to poor skeletal/mesh weighting (contorted necks and arms are the most obvious areas), and low quality textures even on the highest setting. Don't look too close at anything our you'll be sorely disappointed.5. Main character talks to himself... a lot. I wouldn't mind too much if he actually had something interesting to say, but the self-monologuing of stupid quips gets old fast.6. No player choice. The game is completely linear and ""on-rails."" This is not the direction AAA games should be going. As a gamer I want more freedom, not more restriction. What's even more insulting is the developer try's to trick the gamer into thinking he has choice by giving him binary: pick A (evil act) or pick B (good act). However, no matter what you pick (I've tested each so far) results in the exact same resulting cut-scene and outcome. What is good about the game:1. The detail of Elizabeth (you're sidekick) is incredible. The artists did an absolutely fantastic job on bringing this character life. The animations are gorgeous, the voice acting is superb, and the interaction in combat feels good. If there's one reason to play this game, its to experience this character truly come to life throughout the story. Bravo.2. The level artists also did a fantastic job. The vistas in the game are simply breath-taking, just don't look too closely at anything and the visage holds up.3. Fascinating story. Not the best, but worth a look. I personally feel the developers tried too hard to be controversial here, by blatantly throwing racism and gender inequality in your face at every chance they can get. However, there are some nice subtitles that are spread throughout the game which was a pleasant surprise.Conclusion:Worth playing. It's definitely not game of the year (Tomb Raider has locked up tight imo), but if you don't mind paying for an interactive movie, and overlooking the inherent console restrictions, this is worth picking up. Even though flying through the city on rails at high speeds is quite fun the first few times, there's really not much else in terms on innovation to the FPS genre.Hope this was helpful,5/10\"
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"I wanted to love this game, I really did.   The original Bioshock is my favorite game of all time, this game had  me longing to go back and play it.  It's been said over and over, yes, the game has a beautiful landscape, other than that, it's a flop.First, there is no lock-picking, puzzles, and very limited upgrading.  I remember playing the original Bioshock and you could hack turrets, camera, etc.  You have one vigor  (lame excuse for plasmids) that can take control of turrets.  It will fire on your enemies for 10 or so seconds then turn back on you.  There is no way to fully take control of them and you find yourself just blowing the thing up as soon as possible.  This brings me to my next point.  I only used shock jockey once acquired, there are seven or so other vigors but use up too much salt and are pointless.  They have a new clothing system but only two or three items are useful.The weapons could have been interesting but they give them all to you right out of the gates.  You can upgrade them easily and they are readily available.  Usually you get better weapons as the game progresses, they just seem to throw them at you whenever.  You can only hold two at a time.  I never found myself really getting to like a certain weapon and upgrading it.  You just pick stuff up, fire it till empty, and some other gun will be lying next to you.There is only one real boss fight, (lady Comstock) all of the other characters are killed via cut scene.  This really make for anti-climatic missions.  The last mission is very mundane and ends up feeling like the previous quest.  I beat this game in probably six hours on hard.\"

I adored the plot, I adored Elizabeth, and I adored the sky city of Columbia. So why do I have no choice but to give this a highly negative review...?The game  is an interactive movie more than it is, well, a game. Every single-player campaign and story released today cannot truly qualify as a game. Everybody who picked up this game would have been grossly unimpressed by the shoddy and thin ""core"" gameplay elements here, had this game been released in the era of real games (80's to the 00's). Given the outstanding reviews, I expected either a retro game experience or a revolutionary one, and got something that would probably be best described as a diluted version of Call of Duty's gameplay. Now, don't bite my head off for that one. It's clear that all FPS games today borrow from the core formula used in ""modern warfare""-type shooters, like the ability to carry only 2 guns, the recoil physics, the *very* specific ammo types, the realistic iron-sights, cover-and-heal mechanics, 'hit' indication on your reticule, checkpoint saves, etc. etc. Newer gamers take these for granted  they are really just annoying little copy-cat additions all the latest FPS games have. The point is, the actual gameplay borrows from a modern shooter and yet feels as clunky and unsatisfying as a previous-generation shooter, failing entirely to be either one.The guns are *extremely* unimaginative and generic (shotgun, burst-gun, sniper rifle, non-sniper rifle...), and some of them are completely useless. This is a highly redundant and annoying system. For example, since you lack alternate firing modes, you literally have to switch to a burst-gun and use exclusive burst-gun ammo instead of using an SMG and switching it to burst fire, saving you one ammo type to collect.There are plasmids in this game, now relabeled as ""vigors"" for some reason. You get several types, each with a very amusing short tutorial video, silent-film style. Unfortunately, though useful and somewhat creative, they are often ineffective and expensive to use.Item collection is erratic as hell. You will find 'vigor ammo' (""salts"") all over non-combat scenes but extremely sparsely placed over areas of prolonged combat. For this reason, you usually find yourself maxing out your relatively small ""salts gauge"" and unable to collect additional salts for half the game, while being unable to use any vigors for the other half of the game because you have no salts left! The same thing applies to ammo, which is made even worse because you can hold very little ammo of any type, and there are far too many types in the game due to the inflated number of generic guns available.Thankfully, however, a very pleasant-looking NPC supplies you with a bit of health, salts and ammo during battle to compensate for the awful item placement. She will give it to you in the nick of time, but if you run out again, you're screwed  you have to wait a very long time to get anything else from her. It works to balance out the poor level design, but it is just a patch on an ugly gameplay wort.For a game with such an enormous graphics budget, some of the characters look very cartoonish while others look human. There are also *very* few face models in this game. Columbia is populated almost entirely with Generic Male NPC #1 and Generic Female NPC #1. I understand the need for face model recycling, but when you have three clones of the same woman in front of you with different voices, it gets ridiculous. There are also many invisible walls, which become apparent when you try to shoot around obstacles or jump on crates. And for the love of The Prophet, don't look at background details too closely! The bag of apples is literally a JPEG of a pile of apples stretched over a bag  and what's worse, the designers put full-3D apples on top of them for the player to collect. The graphics are *very* far from being fleshed-out in any way here.The best weapon is a melee hand-held slicing thingy, kind of like the painkiller (if you can even remember that game...) You use it to bash enemies' heads in, and you can perform overly gruesome finishing moves with it. There is *no* reason to use these moves, unless you like seeing heads explode, and the little indicator that tells you when to activate them is not easy to find in a pinch. Also, every time you melee, the camera gets fixed in the attacking direction, meaning if you melee multiple times, your character is thrown between enemies and you're essentially just button mashing at that point, because you can't see what's going on. The number of enemy types is also slim and uninteresting.In short, play this game for the story. It's a pretty good one, but if you were expecting a fun game, look elsewhere!!\"

On the whole, it's just a terrible reproduction of the first BioShock but set in the sky for novelty. It's difficulty is so easy a child could finish it, (perhaps this explains the high scores,) and the story just feels like something a first year student would write an essay about after their first spliff. (Heavy man).Oh I forgot to mention the Willy Wonka lift at the beginning! HaHa, that was so funny, oh it wasn't meant to be..?3 stars for the sky-lines.\"

Also difficulty is pretty low i cannot even imagine how easier the game could get on lower difficulties.

There is also that unpleasant fact that this game embrace only checkpoint saves. So not being a fanboy nor hater i have to say Bioshock Infinite is pretty average game with tremendous hype, I'm glad i got my copy free because otherwise i would be really really angry at myself for wasting money. P.S. for all the people that say Bioshock is best rated FPS in history just check Half Life 2 and see for yourself\"
2013,Bioshock Infinite,I fell for the hype and bought it because of all the rave reviews but didn't like it at all. A mediocre shooter at best with dated graphics and uninteresting setting and story.
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"I mean, if nothing else the game certainly looks nice, the visual aesthetic is great. That being said, the rest of the game is pretty bad compared to Bioshock 1 and is absolutely wiped out by SS2. There are three different variations on a machine gun and three different variants on a grenade launcher alone. I actually feel like I'm playing Halo in the sky with this one  move from one wide-open area with obvious cover and spawning generic enemies to kill, then move to the next and repeat. Oh, and don't forget Elizabeth, who you either have to comfort every ten minutes or who throws you health and ammo like nobody's business because god forbid there's a little bit of challenge. Not to mention the needlessly complicated time travel 2deep4u plot with, guess what, a twist halfway through the game! Oh man, it's almost like we didn't see this coming because Ken Levine hasn't put this in two famous games already! Why Halo 4 has a 6.9 user score but this has a 9.0 is beyond me when they both suffer from the same problems. Oh, and I almost forgot to mention the completely subtle message of Booker immediately becoming a racist dick upon being baptized. Nice job with the subtlety, Ken.\"

In contrast to the dark, dank underwater city that is Rapture, Infinite is set inThe Bioshock series is well known for creating an exciting yet often disturbing world to immerse yourself in and Bioshock Infinite certainly doesn\t stray far. Under the brightly coloured mask that Infinite wears, hides the same unsettling tone. Bioshock: Infinite is set in a whole new world to explore. In contrast to the dark, dank underwater city that is Rapture, Infinite is set in Zachary Comstock\s city in the sky \ Columbia. Bioshock: Infinite comes into its own with a new, engaging and unique storyline to get stuck into. But it isn\t entirely separate from previous Bioshock games; there are many links and references \ including a lovely little visit to Rapture \ to feed the nostalgia. Also, except some minor name swaps, many of the basic combat mechanics carried over, along with some exciting twists.You play as Booker Dewitt, a man overcome by guilt, trying to pay off past sins by completing a single task; recovering the \lamb\ of Columbia. Now, this may seem like quite the fetch mission, however, Elizabeth Comstock turns out to be one of the most interesting characters in the game (as well as a very useful companion). The storyline consistently carries an air of mystery that keeps you pushing forward for the next detail. There are also other intriguing characters with their own side-stories running alongside Booker and Elizabeth\s that build further on the immersion. Some important mentions include: the Lutece twins- two multiverse-travelling quantum physicists, Jeremiah Fink - a powerful business man with quite the role in Columbia and Daisy Fitzroy \ the leader of the Vox, a resistance against the corrupt dictator, Comstock. The DLC gives even further detail into the circumstances that led to each of the different fates that could become Columbia and the world as a whole adding another layer of intrigue. The game wraps off nicely with a unique ending that will leave a mark and raises many questions and may even bring about a feels-train.As previously mentioned, many of the same basic mechanics are kept such as the use of EVE (now called salts) to power plasmids (now called vigors). Infinite is set up to be parallel to Bioshock 2, later explaining the similar characteristics yet different names. However, there are many new features that are unique to Infinite. The major change is the use of Elizabeth\s ability to open tears, bringing in new ways to fight such as bringing in turrets or useful environmental objects such as puddles. Tears are used on a sort of cooldown, closing after a set amount of time and therefore need to be used tactfully but can be incredibly useful when turning the tide of a battle. There are also new ways to get around the map via the addition of sky-hooks that allow a new form of mobility \ sky-lines \ but also doubles up as a neat melee weapon. Enemies also utilise this, often creating chaotic yet incredibly fun battles. Infinite also introduces a new range of enemies such as the Handyman, Songbird (my personal favourite) and motorised patriots each with their own set of strengths and weaknesses, and levels of difficulty.The graphics of the original game may not compare to that of more recently released games, there has been a re-master for newer platforms which further adds to the games quality. It is also important to note that the graphics are highly stylized and therefore not meant to be overly realistic Overall, the story in Infinite, while it can be confusing at times, is one of its best features, as well as the interesting game-play mechanics.\"
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"So, to be clear. I was not a fan of the first Bioshock. The twist in that was asinine and completely out of left field, it was something that a washed up Shyamalan would come up with. Infinite was good.

I was not a fan of the first Bioshock. The twist in that was asinine and completely out of left field, it was something that a washed up Shyamalan would come up with. Infinite was good. The story, although in my opinion far from brilliant, was still very good for a video game seeing how rarely video games have good plots and actually had something of a smart twist in it, unlike the first one. I've seen people complaining about 'low texture quality'. Please, oh please tell me you are joking. The game looks fantastic. If they can make the game look great without destroying people's frame rates, why in any logical world would they not?In my opinion, ten hours is too short for any game, as that's all it took me to beat it. Nonetheless, in comparison to a lot of ""next gen"" (how I hate that word due to the awfulness of a lot of the games it's attached to) games, it's damn near a masterpiece, and definitely worth trying out if it's on sale or whatever. I also had no issues with the game play, all in all I'd estimate I've played at least two thousand hours of first person shooter games and this is far from being terrible. It's not the most creative of shooters (I suppose the first Bioshock had that element going for it when it came out), but it gets the job done, the aesthetic of it all is brilliant and it has two genuinely likable protagonists. Don't overlook this one after seeing what some people have been saying about it as while they're quite justified in wanting more, by our modern game standards this is pretty good.\"
2013,Bioshock Infinite,"Alright. Bioshock Infinite. I've only now finished this game, despite having it for a while, and I thought I'd give my impressions of it. First of all, it is undeniably overrated. Playing the last Bioshock games and moving to this one; they haven't really done anything revolutionary. Sure, it's an enjoyable game, and it mixes up the FPS genre, but it really isn't worth the perfect scoresAlright. Bioshock Infinite. I've only now finished this game, despite having it for a while, and I thought I'd give my impressions of it. First of all, it is undeniably overrated. Playing the last Bioshock games and moving to this one; they haven't really done anything revolutionary. Sure, it's an enjoyable game, and it mixes up the FPS genre, but it really isn't worth the perfect scores that are granted to it.To start, seeing as it's a PC game, let's look at the graphics. Stunning, right? Well yeah, they're pretty good, but considering the game is linear, it isn't really cutting edge. Not to say it's ugly, but it's using the sort of water-colour pallet which can be found in other games like Dishonoured. It's nice to look at, but it isn't really the breath taking sights which appear in games such as Metro: Last Light or Crysis 3.As for the gameplay, it's fun, and I can lose time in it, but it can feel a little bit shallow at times. Before you rage against me, examine the 'vigors' of the game. The same as plasmids in the former Bioshocks, they give you superhuman powers with which you can wreck everything. But among them, there are just a few too many similarities for my liking. Bucking Bronco, Undertow and Shock Jockey all have effects which aren't particularly unique. The first upgrade essentially stuns an enemy. The second upgrades mix things up a bit but then other similarities can be found; for example the mine effects of Shock Jockey and Devil's Kiss. Some are more interesting, like Charge or Possession, but in the end they don't act too differently to, say, shooting an enemy in another game in a weak spot and watching them recoil. Add some gunplay of which the most interesting part are the gun noises, and it failed to give any memorable weapons, or moment's that I'll remember using them.As for the story...it's interesting? Elizabeth is a nice character, but I feel as if she's kinda there to cater to the audiences' idea of a perfect girl, or something thereabouts. Booker is one of those protagonists with a grizzled attitude, tough guy exterior blah blah blah. He had some interesting moments, but most of those seemed to be swept up in his  choices. Some of the more interesting plot developments later on in the game just made me feel disconnected; I won't spoil them, but it feels as if your actions have less effect on your own environment, and that just makes me question Booker's actions all the more.All in all, it's not a bad game by any means. Moments like moving around on the sky rail were always fun, but I just feel that it hasn't really turned out to be as good as everyone said. Gameplay is solid, graphics are nice and the story will probably leave some people in love with the characters, but I don't think it's worth full price, especially if you're buying for a console for whatever reason. Wait for a steam sale, pick it up and play through it and then you'll be able to get all the necessary references. If you're not interested in that sort of thing, then you might want to give it a miss.\"

Despite its obvious irrelevance to the series, the games story is rather interesting, although at times the voice acting can go from very good to very bad in just a few short moments what really makes this game shine is that it places you into a world that feels very alive. Although this is not a strength in a game like Bioshock, where you play an aggressor the entire time. Having no abilities to interact with the citizens of Columbia is a major downfall, from the star of this game you most certainly do not feel like a hero. Game feel and story aside the combat can be bland and sometimes frustrating, though the sky hook is interesting it also can place you into enemy fire with ease as you will find someone flanking you without even being aware of where they came from. This aside the combat feels rewarding even after taking down the same copy pasted enemies dozens of time each encounter still felt rewarding. With beautiful graphics and wonderful visuals and for those of you dense enough to not guess the ending, a great story though despite being filled to the overflowing brim with plot holes is captivating and interesting. However the only reason I cannot give this game a better score is that it has simply no business being a ""Bioshock"" game. With only a slight amount of references to the Bioshock series that not only feel forced but feel completely out of place, being a game that takes place before the creation of Andrew Ryan's Rapture there is very little in this game that justifies itself as being called Bioshock. The only reason ""Bioshock Infinite"" was named as such was to make money off of a franchise that was guaranteed to make sales. Even if you are a giant Bioshock fan this games ending will keep you happy as this ""filler episode"" of a game has no relevance in the long run of the series. However if you have never played a Bioshock game, great news this isn't really a Bioshock game anyway.\"

It turns out that this is partially true, in that one character (Elizabeth) is memorable, as is the gimmick of a floating city and dimension-hopping. However, the rest of the story is blah, and all ends aren't satisfactorily resolved by the ending cinimatics. Is this a relatively good story for a shooter? Absolutely. Would the story stand on it's own as a book or even a movie? Never.But back to what I liked about the game: the power system works pretty well, in fact it is probably the best  thing about this game (a megaman-like dependence on exploiting enemy weaknesses becomes important in late game or high difficulties), and the combos feel powerful, as do purchase-able upgrades. Which speaks to another positive: you cannot afford to buy all the upgrades. This means finding out what your play style is and sticking to it, which is a glimmer of integrity from the increasingly erratic 2K Games.What sucks? Well, for starters there are FREQUENT framerate issues on a high-end PC, as well as game-breaking occasions where enemies, floors, walls, etc. are unsee-able because their skins don't show up. Is the air shooting you? It will go away with a restart, but if the autosave was in an inconvenient spot, you still have to play it over, aside from the obvious downside of completely breaking your momentum. I also have gripes about the story. The first 80% of the game explains nothing-which is fine, if you are playing a mystery game. Why doesn't this work here? Because the objectives you spent all that time pursuing no longer exist when you hop a reality. You end up with a Lord-of-the-Rings style question at the end: why didn't we just fly to Mt Doom (or the final Bioshock bad-guy fight, as the case may be) and skip the big nothing in the middle? Furthermore, only one characters motives are explained (Booker's, don't expect ever to find out what is going on with the twins) and many loose ends remain.SUMMARY: Was this game good? Well, the last 20% had satisfying gameplay and there were moments of greatness... I'd say it is worth playing if you can get it on sale for $15 or less. Don't expect story greatness, or even bug-free gaming, though.\"

2013,Super Mario 3D,"Gameplay will never change. There is this mass illusion in the game industry that each game has mechanics slightly more polished than its predecessors. While you can tweak it a bit, the shooter formula has reached its apex, and while Bioshock Infinite does improve superficially on both the vigors and the guns, especially in the latter category (gunfire and recoil more realistic), it's really what it doesn't do that the game needed more of. Some have complained about the lack of RPG elements (with the exception of gun and vigor upgrades), such as inventory or map screen. I found this to be a huge improvement. There is no menu interaction to slow the pacing and you're always on the move. I thought the tone of the game world would have felt more immersive with the lack of a HUD, much like the first gameplay demo Irrational Games released several years ago. But all of the above are personal opinions and design choices. What left a sour taste in my mouth wasn't anything you can experience in the game itself. No, you could only experience this bittersweet regret if you had watched, in eager anticipation, all of Ken Levine's interviews, only to realize you had just witnessed the biggest cop out in gaming history.Expectation #1: An actual floating city, complete with physics.After the first demo that was released (which is never shown in the game), we see one of the massive, orange balloons tethered to the corner of a belltower deflate suddenly and the massive structure starts to pivot towards the ground, the bell flying loose from its moorings only to come grinding to a stop inches away from your feet, the cobblestones buckling under its weight and shooting off in every direction. Later, Ken Levine commented on the instablity of the city, how the tech team had made it pulse with life, and hinted that you'd be able to topple the city around you. This fell short on both accounts, the only undulating architecture in the game appearing during the first half, and after you're solidly captivated by the world, these stellar sights give way to more mundane gameplay (street shootouts and interior combat). It never feels like their main selling point is really taken to its full potential.Expectation #2: Watch the city tear itself apart (pre-Rapture)This is the big one. I want to be as harsh as possible when I say that this was a blatant lie. We were supposedly going to 'watch the city fall apart before us'. We were told that there would be moments where you would have to interact with citizens on the street, such as pointing a gun at a potential mugger to send him scrambling, or intervening in a local execution (both of which are shown in the same demo). There are maybe three moments in the entire game where you feel this sort of weight behind your actions, and they are as superfluous as they are dull. You can't change the overall outcome of anything, although watching the colorful, Independence Day style utopia burn slowly is captivating in its own way. I would have preferred a little more interaction, hence replayability.Expectation #3: A decent resolution.This one is debatable. And the main reason for the spoilers tag. Let's get the big one out of the way, the resolutions to each storyline. Both Daisy Fitzroy and Jeremiah Fink are shadowbox characters that bleed out of the story as quickly as they pop in. Slate is one of the more interesting characters but doesn't feel fully fleshed out. Don't get me started on Comstock. Let's face it, time travel was both the protagonist and antagonist here. It solves everything (most levels are going back and forth through the area in different time periods), and also helps ease along the ruthlessly shoehorned ending. But despite all of this, the ending was emotional and relatively significant enough to make it feel as if it 'belonged'. It was the gamer in me that made me want to slap Ken Levine. Songbird becomes your best bud and then you get to watch him drown in two seconds. Apparently the Bioshock story will never change because even with its fairly restricted narrative parameters, it's the doorway to infinite worlds just like it with new coats of paint (so we can expect this disappointment forever). Oh, and my personal favorite: The final boss is three waves of the easiest enemies in the game. No Handyman. No Songbird. Fail.But aside from all the things they promised and didn't deliver, this is a bittersweet shooter, with some amazingly satisfying gameplay regarding the vigors and gunplay, but some equally frustrating inconsistencies in the pacing and storyline. Oh, and this game tries desperately to emulate Disney (and doesn't do a bad job), but it's so obvious in parts it's almost painful, especially if you're like me and find the overall 'girl in a tower' concept a little overused and cheesy.Still, if you're a fan of shooters or Bioshock in general, you owe it to yourself to see how far the series has come.\"

The city of Columbia was built with passion and care. The art STYLING is brilliant. Likewise the main characters are sublime. Certain set-pieces are BRILLIANT. Yet finally this game does not stand up as a product that is worth $60. It is far too short and the shooting/exploring elements are far too limited, a kind of theatrical filler between the numerous set-pieces of this scenic railroad. Good though it is, this is a game to wait for. Wait till the hype blows over and get it when it hits its true value of around $20. The combat is fun but not challenging. Enemy AI is weak. The game is also far too linear and NARROW in terms of both player progress and narrative. The game finally exposes its true weaknesses, after many great moments when the plot falls to pieces at the end with one of the most head-scratching (in a negative sense) and RIDICULOUS conclusions you will ever see in a game. The ending is not deep. It is not a philosphical marvel. It's an incoherent mess that will have you wondering what the team at Irrational Games have been smoking for the last FIVE YEARS. While the anti-American Exceptionism is fairly amusing is is also over-played. Doesn't Ken Levine understand the word subtlety? Bioware Infinite is definitely a game to be enjoyed when the price comes down. I understand the desire of users to praose any game to the heavens. It happened also with Skyrim, which simply was also not very good. Keep waiting boys and girls, a true 10/10 game will get made eventually. Enough dudes are working at it.\"

Bioshock Infinite is my favorite game to date, no question about it.To start, the art direction is very good. Everything is arranged to be very appealing, and the colors are very balanced. I loved just walking around the city and soaking it all up. There are 1912 style shops to go into, and they are all populated. In one area, there is even a good, three-minute quartet that you can just sit and listen to. I was very impressed with the magnitude of everything. Seldom are you placed in a small, dark room or hallway. Most of the game is set in colorful areas with large statues and airy buildings.I liked that it didn't actually put you in the dark, but gave a dark feeling when it was appropriate. As per the Bioshock games, some of the events are quite dark-- and I liked the uneasy feeling without the dark corridors of Rapture.Combat is a step up from other games in the genre. The introduction of ""skylines"" allows you to jump quickly from place to place, making everything very fast paced. I didn't quite like the inventory management as much as in the original Bioshock, however. I found it much harder to deal with my Vigors, mainly because you couldn't just scroll through them like in the other game. Still, you get used to it-- that's a fairly minor gripe.I can't really say much about the story. If I told you what was so great about it, I'd spoil it for you. I can say that it puzzled me, and it was a few hours after finishing the game that I worked everything out. I felt like some of the points were repeated too much though. I get that they try to help everyone understand it well, but I'd rather just have it all thrown at me-- that way it's more fun to work out on my own.Overall, Irrational Games has gone above and beyond what anyone expected. The only way you'd find this game worse than the original is if you're somewhat nostalgic. Even if you didn't like the first or second game, I really suggest that you still give Bioshock Infinite a try. As a side note, there are a few things that you won't quite understand if you skip the first game. They are little details, but in a game like Bioshock Infinite, it's those little details that really count.This game is worth every cent. If you can't afford it, you can get it off the grey market for an earbud or so (about $35).\"
2013,Super Mario 3D,"Awesome game! Cool graphic design and perfect soundtrack. Love it very much. Action is very dynamic and the story is interesting so far. A graphics itself feels kinda old, but light effects are awesome, so i don't have any complaints. It's a little bit laggy on ultra 1080p on my GTX 560, but i hope they'll fix it later."

In a market saturated by ""HOORA AMERICA""shooters (Battlefield, Call of Duty, Homefront, Medal of Honor), it's refreshing to see a game tear American Exceptionalism apart. While the gameplay is pretty solid, the real stars are the story and the world. The developers took a lot of big risks in this game, with a lot of decisions that could have easily backfired and ruined the whole experience. The fact that everything works so well together is remarkable in its own right. I think calling it ""The greatest game of all time"" like some other reviewers are is kind of a stretch, but certainly I don't think anything else coming out this year will even approach the quality of Bioshock Infinite. If you liked the first Bioshock, you probably already have this game, but if you don't you owe it to yourself to get this. If you felt that the gameplay was dull in the original Bioshock or that that lack of subtlety in dealing with broader philosophical and political concepts was problematic, you're going to find the same issues here. However, I absolutely loved the experience.\"

Bioshock Infinite is certainly one to be remembered, and with the nourishing level of detail, forgetting the beauty (and ensuing chaos) of Columbia will prove difficult for any gamer. With the physics engines and graphics cards of 2013, Infinite leaves us thinking ""Damn, if only Rapture had looked this good.""If anything could be said against the game, it would be Irrational's lack of effort towards creating a fully function AI society. Whilst the player is indeed submerged in a city with non-aggressive AI to bolster the feeling that you are in a real human settlement and not just a war zone, Irrational struggles to do this improvement over the game's predecessors any real justice with the lack of interaction between the AI and the player itself. One finds themself questioning the difference between taking stuff from a chest of drawers and taking stuff from a chest of drawers with the word 'steal' at the bottom of the screen, demonstrating the scripted incidents carried out by the competely robotic artificial intelligence.\"

Seriously, some of the stuff in these comments is ridiculous. The setting is ""unimaginative""? What? How can you complain about a steampunk, floating city being ""unimaginative"" when there are games like Call of Duty and Battlefield getting farted out that use a brown, dust filled desert-industrial environment which seems to be a sort of basic formula for games nowadays. Anyway, the setting IS imaginative, and the story IS good, anybody who is saying the story ""made no sense"" probably just didn't understand it because they have the IQ of a coconut. The story made sense perfectly fine to me, and to 98% of the other people who played the game, as well. That said, if you don't like exploring, and just prefer to shoot people, don't buy this game and then complain that it was too well paced and you didn't spend 100% of your time killing other humans, because there is a big emphasis on exploration in this game, gear, money, and voxophones, which flesh out the story really nicely are all found by exploration. Also you get to see more of the city and experience the graphics design, because it is spectacular. Basically, it has everything good that the first Bioshock had, fast paced and exciting combat, amazing, albeit very different, atmosphere, an emphasis on exploration and a great story, without the redundant binary moral choice system. Also Elizabeth is a really nice addition to the game, one of the best support characters since Alyx.Basically, if you haven't played it, and are here to write a bad review because you watched TotalBiscuit's WTF is? video, then go away. If you DID play it, and didn't enjoy it, fair enough, but don't criticise something simply because of its genre. Yes, it didn't have any puzzles or stealth. Do you know why? Because it's an FPS, you moron.  Anyway, if you enjoyed the original, you'll love this, it's definitely a Bioshock game, I'd say it was even better than the 1st.  The worst thing about it was the soundtrack, and that's just because I can't remember anything about it, and I finished the game yesterday. Great combat, great story, great atmosphere, great pacing, great graphics, it did everything well. I'm giving it a 9 because of a few things I didn't like. The vigors are a bit unoriginal, except for the Bucking Bronco and Murder of Crows, and even that is basically just a repackaged Insect Swarm from B1. I preferred the gun upgrade system in B1, and the upgrades for that were much more original than the ones in this, which pretty much consist of ""damage increase"", ""clip size increase"", ""recoil decrease"", and ""accuracy increase"". It's a fantastic game, but there ARE a few things that stop it from being a 10. I would give it 9.5 if I could, but there is no 9.5,  so it gets a 9. I loved it, and will definitely buy the DLC planned.\"

However, once you get that out of the way, it's a much better version of it than the previous two.  For example, while combat is still the same setup (replace plasmid with vigor) and enemies still can feel a little bullet-spongy (I recommend turning off health meters in the options menu, as well as most other HUD notifications), most encounters take place in these big open areas that are also densely packed with cool tactical options.  The result is some thrilling and crazy combat moments that in most games would be heavily scripted.  No more ""electrocute-wrench"" through the whole game.  Graphically, you can sometimes see some flat textures up close reminding you that this is a game that has been worked on for 6 years, but on the whole it is quite gorgeous.  Nice to play an FPS that doesn't look like a brown and grey modern military shooter or a future space war that might as well  be a military shooter for how it looks.On that note, this game has the best storytelling since Half-Life 2.  No sitting through pre-rendered cutscenes full of people spewing exposition at you.  Just exploring the environment explains what's going on in the world and hints at some weird stuff behind the surface.  This game also deals with racism and religious fundamentalism in a far less heavy handed manner than you would expect.  Nice to play a game that doesn't treat you like a moron who can't follow a simple story.So in summary: Yes, if you go into this game expecting it to be the industry-changing miracle some people are making it out to be, you will be let down.  But if you go in expecting an FPS that is far more immersive, original and entertaining than 95% of what you've played in the last few years, you'll get it.  Hell, it's basically a 10-hour escort mission with a character you still care about by the end and never get annoyed with.  That alone deserves some kudos.\"

I also really enjoyed the story and thought the characters were interesting and having Elizabeth as a partner was very fun and worked really well.  Points deducted for repetitive combat and repetitive enemies. The powers are not very inspired and have a simplistic ""fire at enemy or lay a trap"". The game stutters when loading new areas even with solid 60fps (gtx 570, settings on med/high) and thus breaks the immersion. You can only carry two guns which is disappointing and I pretty much went the entire game with raven power, shock power, sniper rifle and machine gun. I very rarely changed tactics and progressed easily with this setup. Was also dissapointed to find med kits had been removed and you cannot carry additional salts to power up your abilities when running low (have to rely on Elizabeth or the surrounding area). Was a good solid game, however the original Bioshock is still my favourite.\"

This game, however, already has those.  As a preface, to truly appreciate this game I think you have to enjoy story telling.  This game is HEAVILY story driven with fantastic writing.  I spent at least an hour in the chapel after landing in Columbia.  Needless to say I have not finished the game  yet  but I am savoring it.  I am playing on hard as suggested by PC Gamer  because most story centric games have little replay value  but this game's story is deep and rich enough to deserve at least another replay.  I know I will replay it with the 1999 option after hard so that I can see how I might end without a winnable ending.  This is a game about the journey.  To rush through it is to completely miss the substance of the game.  This is not an ADD friendly game.  While the combat is exhilarating and amazingly fun (much like but improved over the original Bioshock) you do have to use tactics and planning to survive.  I also appreciate that on the non-1999 version you are not overly punished for screwing up and experimenting.  The voice acting, the graphics, the atmosphere, the sheer creative genius of this world inspired me to buy a season pass as I would love more of this game.  Ken Levine and the entire Irrational Games team should be given a well deserved standing ovation.  I hope that Irrational will take their time, but not as much time, developing their next game.  A return to a cyberpunk world would be wonderful, perhaps as a System Shock 3?  Take a well deserved break Mr. Levine  come back refreshed and let that genius flow again into yet another wonderful experience.\"

There is a reason why originals hold their place in our hearts compared to sequels. Nothing Irrational Games does will capture the heart of Rapture again!

Gone is the rapidlyThe great grandson of the legendary System Shock 2 is a sobering example of how even venerated IP's can end with a whimper, not a bang. Gone is the atmosphere of tension, solitude and slow, cloying fear, of being a rat in an alien maze, desperately fighting the machinations of a near-ubiquitously powerful, intelligent enemy who hates you more than anything else. Gone is the rapidly blurring dichotomy of you and the warped genetic monstrosities you fight against. Gone is the sprawling, labyrinthine level-design that made you feel a stranger in an even stranger land.Instead, brightly coloured setpieces tower above poor-quality environmental textures plagued by pop-in effects and graphical errors. All pretensions of atmosphere disappear in a neo-Americana hell, populated by  a number of identical racist caricatures whose threat towards you is as laughable as their suicidal and stupid combat AI. What tropes of old remain, like the strange powers you and an illogically small proportion of NPC's possess, the garish, loudly coloured vending machines, are not given even the merest pretensions of logical existence in a world that remains true to the 'Shock series in barely more than name alone.The satisfying gunplay of Bioshock is replaced with something that seems two steps back  guns feel like they lack weight and impact, melee combat has gone from having some of the most visceral and brutal force to an insufficient, chaotic slugfest. Each blow of the wrench in Bioshock 1 felt like the fist of an angry God compared to the mess that is Infinite's hand to hand combat. Weapon upgrades feel tacked on, (gone are the tactical uses for each weapon: You will rarely require to change between two.) lacking the incredibly unique feeling and game-changing add-ones of Bioshock that added striking visual components to your weaponry.Gunplay itself is almost parodic  your limited selection of weapons, when the gimmicky or inferior are pared away, leave you to fight against generic waves of identical enemies with your iron sights and  in what feels like a near slap in the face, _regenerating shields._Plasmids (or 'vigours') feel similarly superfluous, despite an obvious attempt to broad the range of options both between and within them. Their use feels as unsatisfying and generic as the gimmicks of many other mid-quality FPS offerings that the Shock pedigree should stand above. Environmental uses for vigours are easily missed and of limited use. Contrast the feel of the fire power in Bioshock and Bioshock Infinite. In the former, a click of the fingers instantly set an enemy ablaze. It was fast, punishing and conveyed the utter power of ADAM, at the expense of your own body. It was a standard fallback for many players for good reason, for it was ubiquitously useful, but not overpowering. In the darkness of Rapture, the flames you ignited with a snap of your fingers were immediate reminders of power.In Infinite, the clunky, slow moving projectile feels more like a grenade. Enemies who rush at you wildly in chaotic, rarely tactical combat make efficient use of the power difficult, and the flames themselves seem ineffectual, difficult to use when other powers are simpler and easier to use. Environmental uses like conveniently placed oil-slicks are rarely of any real value. The use of almost any vigour seems a waste of resources. Unsatisfying, unrewarding, unpolished.The story itself is a decidedly average mess, riddled with plot holes and uncompelling characters. Your constant companion is, while relatively likeable and useful, not something I expected from a franchise that made it's name on the back of well-crafted atmospheric tension.Gone too are some of the rewarding RPG elements, replaced by a bizarre 'gear' system that seems more at home in a Borderlands game than Bioshock. Not a few hours into the game and you are furnished with a pair of trousers that allow you to punch people from three-times the distance away, (often launching you off the edge of the city to an untimely, undeserved death) or another item of clothing that inexplicably causes opponents you strike in melee to spontaneously burst into flames and burn to skeletons before your eyes. A hat it was, I think. What were they thinking?!This is of course rhetorical. It is obvious what they were thinking. A combination of changing appeal to a casual audience and rushed production values, Infinite is the death-knell of the 'Shock series. What's worse is that the this same audience of 'gamers', too captivated by their understanding of (actually visually average, but disguised by gross amounts of bloom and fog) setpieces that the developer literally drags your attention to as 'good graphics', (which is what a good game is all about, right?) who purchase an identical Call of Duty game EVERY year, are lapping titles like Infinite up.Rest In Peace.

Frankly, most of the elements that were unique to BioShock have been utterly stripped from this title. There's still plasmids (Vigors) and a steampunk setting but that is where the similarities cease. The hacking elements are gone,  lockpicking is taken away from the player and given to an AI, the research camera is removed, and paying attention to health has been replaced with the all-too-generic ""regenerating health"" mechanic. BioShock's ""Big Daddies"" are replaced with ""Handymen"" who are seen far too infrequently, and ""Motorized Patriots"" which are overused. The vast majority of the enemy AI are merely footsolders who are easy to defeat (and completely stupid) even on the hardest setting. The shooting mechanics have never been particularly strong in the BioShock franchise but BioShock Infinite strips it down further, allowing players to carry only two weapons at any given time like any other stock FPS title. In addition, the vigor powers themselves are lackluster and chances are you'll go through the entire game running with Possession (the hacking ""replacement"") and Bucking Bronco or Murder of Crows (the two Vigors which have the most effect on enemy mobs  loss of control and stun+damage, respectively). We get Vigor powers like ""Shock Jockey"" (the name should tell you what it does) and the game points out how we can use it to power up devices  but then we only get one particular device to use it on and little reason to use it again. So this leaves us with the story which seems to be getting the most praise. However, the story itself is a series of walking cliches and tropes about multiverse theory and time-space manipulation and, frankly, has been addressed better elsewhere in countless science fiction novels, movies, TV shows, and even comic books. When the game explains the concepts of ""constants and variables"" in the multiverse it feels more like they're attempting to justify why the game took such a hard 90 degree turn away from previous gameplay demos in order to proffer this metaphysical theme. Where, for example, is the Elizabeth AI we were shown where she fought along side of us? Gone and replaced with a cowering AI that gets in the way and offers little help but tossing us items from time to time. Where, for example, were the critical moments in the game shown during gameplay demos of E3's past? Gone and replaced with overly cerebral tropes about quantum mechanics and multiple realities. Where, for example, are all the examples of how the sky-rail plays a critical role in the game? Just gone, entirely. Don't get me wrong, the story is heads and shoulders better than MOST games these days and the attention to detail is second to none. For those reasons alone the game should be experienced at least once. It's just the story isn't nearly as new OR earth shattering as many claim it to be and, if I didn't care about spoilers, I could point out how Infinite almost perfectly parallels the story of Walter and Peter Bishop from the TV show Fringe. While the story is better than most it really doesn't make the shortcomings of the gameplay easier to bear. Finally, for a game which was designed exclusively for single player, the game is very short, clocking in at a total of 14 hours on the hard difficulty setting with most of the collectibles obtained. Given the fact that many elements were chopped out of the gameplay videos, I can't help but wonder how much is sitting on the cutting room floor, or if key parts were stripped in order to push out fast DLC. There's no reason this game shouldn't have been AT LEAST 20 hours in length, especially given how linear it is designed. All in all, it's a decent game but painfully average in terms of gameplay and only barely above average in terms of story. Levine spent so much time on the metaphysical that it feels like he and the development team forgot that it was all of the elements, combined, that made BioShock so distinct and enjoyable. It's worth playing at least once to soak in all the wonder but, sadly, you won't really be going back to play it again since nothing (except difficulty) changes between play throughs.\"

Gameplay hours ran me about 6 hours in total. In terms of gameplay itself the only unique thing about it was the skyline which was fun to use. The rest of the game itself just didn't feel that great. Looking out in the distance and looking at the view and the world that they created was awesome. One thing to expect is repetitive gameplay. You will find all the missions to be the same. You will be running from map to map running and gunning. There were no unique quests. Even after finishing I felt as if it was extremely liner and have no desire to return to this game. The only thing this game has for it was its super awesome voice acting and its stunning visuals. The skyline added a very unique system but it was a bit disappointing. All in all I gotta rate this game a 6.5/10. Due to the weird plot twists, uninteresting enemies, repetitive gameplay. If this game would improve its maps. Making everything more like its original. This game would easily make my top of the list. It all came down to its average gameplay and linear story. The game was incredibly easy.

It feels like a very average last gen game to me. I prefer gameplay to graphics but i found this game lacking in both. I am genuinely confused by the gushing reviews of ""perfection"" this and ""masterpiece"" that.It was a constant race toward the reason to switch it off. Between the boredom and the motion sickness caused by the poor mouse sensitivity settings, i got no enjoyment from this title at all. The motion sickness piped it in the end and i gladly quit after only a few hours ....probably forever.For goodness sake play a demo! I guess this game is love it or hate it. P.S. If someone wants to pay me a large amount in used notes, i will say its great aswell!\"

The same is true for sprint and crouch. Where is the customization? It's a crime this feature was left out of the PC port.2. Forced to edit .ini files. The mouse aiming is atrocious on default. It wasn't until I read that mouse smoothing and auto-aim was enabled by default that I was able to fix this problem. Again, there are no settings in game to toggle these. You have to dig around in .ini file to turn them off manually. 3. You can only carry 2 guns. The hell? Who thought this was a good idea? In both prior incarnations of the game you had the freedom to choose any gun available for the situation. Now you are pigeon holed. Decreasing the amount of choice in a game is simply bad design.4. Bloom and DOF covers up incredibly low poly-count models, extreme polygon warping in many animations due to poor skeletal/mesh weighting (contorted necks and arms are the most obvious areas), and low quality textures even on the highest setting. Don't look too close at anything our you'll be sorely disappointed.5. Main character talks to himself... a lot. I wouldn't mind too much if he actually had something interesting to say, but the self-monologuing of stupid quips gets old fast.6. No player choice. The game is completely linear and ""on-rails."" This is not the direction AAA games should be going. As a gamer I want more freedom, not more restriction. What's even more insulting is the developer try's to trick the gamer into thinking he has choice by giving him binary: pick A (evil act) or pick B (good act). However, no matter what you pick (I've tested each so far) results in the exact same resulting cut-scene and outcome. What is good about the game:1. The detail of Elizabeth (you're sidekick) is incredible. The artists did an absolutely fantastic job on bringing this character life. The animations are gorgeous, the voice acting is superb, and the interaction in combat feels good. If there's one reason to play this game, its to experience this character truly come to life throughout the story. Bravo.2. The level artists also did a fantastic job. The vistas in the game are simply breath-taking, just don't look too closely at anything and the visage holds up.3. Fascinating story. Not the best, but worth a look. I personally feel the developers tried too hard to be controversial here, by blatantly throwing racism and gender inequality in your face at every chance they can get. However, there are some nice subtitles that are spread throughout the game which was a pleasant surprise.Conclusion:Worth playing. It's definitely not game of the year (Tomb Raider has locked up tight imo), but if you don't mind paying for an interactive movie, and overlooking the inherent console restrictions, this is worth picking up. Even though flying through the city on rails at high speeds is quite fun the first few times, there's really not much else in terms on innovation to the FPS genre.Hope this was helpful,5/10\"
2013,Super Mario 3D,"I wanted to love this game, I really did.   The original Bioshock is my favorite game of all time, this game had  me longing to go back and play it.  It's been said over and over, yes, the game has a beautiful landscape, other than that, it's a flop.First, there is no lock-picking, puzzles, and very limited upgrading.  I remember playing the original Bioshock and you could hack turrets, camera, etc.  You have one vigor  (lame excuse for plasmids) that can take control of turrets.  It will fire on your enemies for 10 or so seconds then turn back on you.  There is no way to fully take control of them and you find yourself just blowing the thing up as soon as possible.  This brings me to my next point.  I only used shock jockey once acquired, there are seven or so other vigors but use up too much salt and are pointless.  They have a new clothing system but only two or three items are useful.The weapons could have been interesting but they give them all to you right out of the gates.  You can upgrade them easily and they are readily available.  Usually you get better weapons as the game progresses, they just seem to throw them at you whenever.  You can only hold two at a time.  I never found myself really getting to like a certain weapon and upgrading it.  You just pick stuff up, fire it till empty, and some other gun will be lying next to you.There is only one real boss fight, (lady Comstock) all of the other characters are killed via cut scene.  This really make for anti-climatic missions.  The last mission is very mundane and ends up feeling like the previous quest.  I beat this game in probably six hours on hard.\"

The setting is incredibly imaginative, the (outdoor) graphics are gorgeous, the plot is semi-brave, mostly fleshed-out and very suspenseful. I adored the plot, I adored Elizabeth, and I adored the sky city of Columbia. So why do I have no choice but to give this a highly negative review...?The game  is an interactive movie more than it is, well, a game. Every single-player campaign and story released today cannot truly qualify as a game. Everybody who picked up this game would have been grossly unimpressed by the shoddy and thin ""core"" gameplay elements here, had this game been released in the era of real games (80's to the 00's). Given the outstanding reviews, I expected either a retro game experience or a revolutionary one, and got something that would probably be best described as a diluted version of Call of Duty's gameplay. Now, don't bite my head off for that one. It's clear that all FPS games today borrow from the core formula used in ""modern warfare""-type shooters, like the ability to carry only 2 guns, the recoil physics, the *very* specific ammo types, the realistic iron-sights, cover-and-heal mechanics, 'hit' indication on your reticule, checkpoint saves, etc. etc. Newer gamers take these for granted  they are really just annoying little copy-cat additions all the latest FPS games have. The point is, the actual gameplay borrows from a modern shooter and yet feels as clunky and unsatisfying as a previous-generation shooter, failing entirely to be either one.The guns are *extremely* unimaginative and generic (shotgun, burst-gun, sniper rifle, non-sniper rifle...), and some of them are completely useless. This is a highly redundant and annoying system. For example, since you lack alternate firing modes, you literally have to switch to a burst-gun and use exclusive burst-gun ammo instead of using an SMG and switching it to burst fire, saving you one ammo type to collect.There are plasmids in this game, now relabeled as ""vigors"" for some reason. You get several types, each with a very amusing short tutorial video, silent-film style. Unfortunately, though useful and somewhat creative, they are often ineffective and expensive to use.Item collection is erratic as hell. You will find 'vigor ammo' (""salts"") all over non-combat scenes but extremely sparsely placed over areas of prolonged combat. For this reason, you usually find yourself maxing out your relatively small ""salts gauge"" and unable to collect additional salts for half the game, while being unable to use any vigors for the other half of the game because you have no salts left! The same thing applies to ammo, which is made even worse because you can hold very little ammo of any type, and there are far too many types in the game due to the inflated number of generic guns available.Thankfully, however, a very pleasant-looking NPC supplies you with a bit of health, salts and ammo during battle to compensate for the awful item placement. She will give it to you in the nick of time, but if you run out again, you're screwed  you have to wait a very long time to get anything else from her. It works to balance out the poor level design, but it is just a patch on an ugly gameplay wort.For a game with such an enormous graphics budget, some of the characters look very cartoonish while others look human. There are also *very* few face models in this game. Columbia is populated almost entirely with Generic Male NPC #1 and Generic Female NPC #1. I understand the need for face model recycling, but when you have three clones of the same woman in front of you with different voices, it gets ridiculous. There are also many invisible walls, which become apparent when you try to shoot around obstacles or jump on crates. And for the love of The Prophet, don't look at background details too closely! The bag of apples is literally a JPEG of a pile of apples stretched over a bag  and what's worse, the designers put full-3D apples on top of them for the player to collect. The graphics are *very* far from being fleshed-out in any way here.The best weapon is a melee hand-held slicing thingy, kind of like the painkiller (if you can even remember that game...) You use it to bash enemies' heads in, and you can perform overly gruesome finishing moves with it. There is *no* reason to use these moves, unless you like seeing heads explode, and the little indicator that tells you when to activate them is not easy to find in a pinch. Also, every time you melee, the camera gets fixed in the attacking direction, meaning if you melee multiple times, your character is thrown between enemies and you're essentially just button mashing at that point, because you can't see what's going on. The number of enemy types is also slim and uninteresting.In short, play this game for the story. It's a pretty good one, but if you were expecting a fun game, look elsewhere!!\"

Also difficulty is pretty low i cannot even imagine how easier the game could get on lower difficulties.I bought this game mainly for the story and characters, but it is not that good, and are mix up of several clichs with several ups and downs and for once finally useful sidekick on the contrary enemy AI is quite poor and you will see big number of enemies stucked in some obstacle. There is also that unpleasant fact that this game embrace only checkpoint saves.This game is quite average, and people need to start thinking for themselves and not pay attention to ""Professional"" reviewers, who are always biased, and have a hidden agenda with their reviews.  Look at IGN for example they had the ""exclusive"" review, so they obviously wont rate it with less than a stellar review.Professional reviews suck, and that is just the plain truth.\"

Under the brightly coloured mask that Infinite wears, hides the same unsettling tone. Bioshock: Infinite is set in a whole new world to explore. In contrast to the dark, dank underwater city that is Rapture, Infinite is set in Zachary Comstock\s city in the sky \ Columbia. Bioshock: Infinite comes into its own with a new, engaging and unique storyline to get stuck into. But it isn\t entirely separate from previous Bioshock games; there are many links and references \ including a lovely little visit to Rapture \ to feed the nostalgia. Also, except some minor name swaps, many of the basic combat mechanics carried over, along with some exciting twists.You play as Booker Dewitt, a man overcome by guilt, trying to pay off past sins by completing a single task; recovering the \lamb\ of Columbia. Now, this may seem like quite the fetch mission, however, Elizabeth Comstock turns out to be one of the most interesting characters in the game (as well as a very useful companion). The storyline consistently carries an air of mystery that keeps you pushing forward for the next detail. There are also other intriguing characters with their own side-stories running alongside Booker and Elizabeth\s that build further on the immersion. Some important mentions include: the Lutece twins- two multiverse-travelling quantum physicists, Jeremiah Fink - a powerful business man with quite the role in Columbia and Daisy Fitzroy \ the leader of the Vox, a resistance against the corrupt dictator, Comstock. The DLC gives even further detail into the circumstances that led to each of the different fates that could become Columbia and the world as a whole adding another layer of intrigue. The game wraps off nicely with a unique ending that will leave a mark and raises many questions and may even bring about a feels-train.As previously mentioned, many of the same basic mechanics are kept such as the use of EVE (now called salts) to power plasmids (now called vigors). Infinite is set up to be parallel to Bioshock 2, later explaining the similar characteristics yet different names. However, there are many new features that are unique to Infinite. The major change is the use of Elizabeth\s ability to open tears, bringing in new ways to fight such as bringing in turrets or useful environmental objects such as puddles. Tears are used on a sort of cooldown, closing after a set amount of time and therefore need to be used tactfully but can be incredibly useful when turning the tide of a battle. There are also new ways to get around the map via the addition of sky-hooks that allow a new form of mobility \ sky-lines \ but also doubles up as a neat melee weapon. Enemies also utilise this, often creating chaotic yet incredibly fun battles. Infinite also introduces a new range of enemies such as the Handyman, Songbird (my personal favourite) and motorised patriots each with their own set of strengths and weaknesses, and levels of difficulty.The graphics of the original game may not compare to that of more recently released games, there has been a re-master for newer platforms which further adds to the games quality. It is also important to note that the graphics are highly stylized and therefore not meant to be overly realistic Overall, the story in Infinite, while it can be confusing at times, is one of its best features, as well as the interesting game-play mechanics.\"
2013,Super Mario 3D,"So, to be clear. I was not a fan of the first Bioshock. The twist in that was asinine and completely out of left field, it was something that a washed up Shyamalan would come up with. Infinite was good.

I was not a fan of the first Bioshock. The twist in that was asinine and completely out of left field, it was something that a washed up Shyamalan would come up with. Infinite was good. The story, although in my opinion far from brilliant, was still very good for a video game seeing how rarely video games have good plots and actually had something of a smart twist in it, unlike the first one. I've seen people complaining about 'low texture quality'. Please, oh please tell me you are joking. The game looks fantastic. If they can make the game look great without destroying people's frame rates, why in any logical world would they not?In my opinion, ten hours is too short for any game, as that's all it took me to beat it. Nonetheless, in comparison to a lot of ""next gen"" (how I hate that word due to the awfulness of a lot of the games it's attached to) games, it's damn near a masterpiece, and definitely worth trying out if it's on sale or whatever. I also had no issues with the game play, all in all I'd estimate I've played at least two thousand hours of first person shooter games and this is far from being terrible. It's not the most creative of shooters (I suppose the first Bioshock had that element going for it when it came out), but it gets the job done, the aesthetic of it all is brilliant and it has two genuinely likable protagonists. Don't overlook this one after seeing what some people have been saying about it as while they're quite justified in wanting more, by our modern game standards this is pretty good.\"
2013,Super Mario 3D,"Alright. Bioshock Infinite. I've only now finished this game, despite having it for a while, and I thought I'd give my impressions of it. First of all, it is undeniably overrated. Playing the last Bioshock games and moving to this one; they haven't really done anything revolutionary. Sure, it's an enjoyable game, and it mixes up the FPS genre, but it really isn't worth the perfect scoresAlright. Bioshock Infinite. I've only now finished this game, despite having it for a while, and I thought I'd give my impressions of it. First of all, it is undeniably overrated. Playing the last Bioshock games and moving to this one; they haven't really done anything revolutionary. Sure, it's an enjoyable game, and it mixes up the FPS genre, but it really isn't worth the perfect scores that are granted to it.To start, seeing as it's a PC game, let's look at the graphics. Stunning, right? Well yeah, they're pretty good, but considering the game is linear, it isn't really cutting edge. Not to say it's ugly, but it's using the sort of water-colour pallet which can be found in other games like Dishonoured. It's nice to look at, but it isn't really the breath taking sights which appear in games such as Metro: Last Light or Crysis 3.As for the gameplay, it's fun, and I can lose time in it, but it can feel a little bit shallow at times. Before you rage against me, examine the 'vigors' of the game. The same as plasmids in the former Bioshocks, they give you superhuman powers with which you can wreck everything. But among them, there are just a few too many similarities for my liking. Bucking Bronco, Undertow and Shock Jockey all have effects which aren't particularly unique. The first upgrade essentially stuns an enemy. The second upgrades mix things up a bit but then other similarities can be found; for example the mine effects of Shock Jockey and Devil's Kiss. Some are more interesting, like Charge or Possession, but in the end they don't act too differently to, say, shooting an enemy in another game in a weak spot and watching them recoil. Add some gunplay of which the most interesting part are the gun noises, and it failed to give any memorable weapons, or moment's that I'll remember using them.As for the story...it's interesting? Elizabeth is a nice character, but I feel as if she's kinda there to cater to the audiences' idea of a perfect girl, or something thereabouts. Booker is one of those protagonists with a grizzled attitude, tough guy exterior blah blah blah. He had some interesting moments, but most of those seemed to be swept up in his  choices. Some of the more interesting plot developments later on in the game just made me feel disconnected; I won't spoil them, but it feels as if your actions have less effect on your own environment, and that just makes me question Booker's actions all the more.All in all, it's not a bad game by any means. Moments like moving around on the sky rail were always fun, but I just feel that it hasn't really turned out to be as good as everyone said. Gameplay is solid, graphics are nice and the story will probably leave some people in love with the characters, but I don't think it's worth full price, especially if you're buying for a console for whatever reason. Wait for a steam sale, pick it up and play through it and then you'll be able to get all the necessary references. If you're not interested in that sort of thing, then you might want to give it a miss.\"

It tries to mix it up a bit by adding in some special enemies like the Fireman or the Handyman but all they do is create an annoyance as they're not very fun to battle and take a ridiculous amount of hits to kill.With all the work that went into the atmosphere of this game, I wish they had taken a bit more time to make it worth playing for more than a half hour at a time.\"

Despite its obvious irrelevance to the series, the games story is rather interesting, although at times the voice acting can go from very good to very bad in just a few short moments what really makes this game shine is that it places you into a world that feels very alive. Although this is not a strength in a game like Bioshock, where you play an aggressor the entire time. Having no abilities to interact with the citizens of Columbia is a major downfall, from the star of this game you most certainly do not feel like a hero. Game feel and story aside the combat can be bland and sometimes frustrating, though the sky hook is interesting it also can place you into enemy fire with ease as you will find someone flanking you without even being aware of where they came from. This aside the combat feels rewarding even after taking down the same copy pasted enemies dozens of time each encounter still felt rewarding. With beautiful graphics and wonderful visuals and for those of you dense enough to not guess the ending, a great story though despite being filled to the overflowing brim with plot holes is captivating and interesting. However the only reason I cannot give this game a better score is that it has simply no business being a ""Bioshock"" game. With only a slight amount of references to the Bioshock series that not only feel forced but feel completely out of place, being a game that takes place before the creation of Andrew Ryan's Rapture there is very little in this game that justifies itself as being called Bioshock. The only reason ""Bioshock Infinite"" was named as such was to make money off of a franchise that was guaranteed to make sales. Even if you are a giant Bioshock fan this games ending will keep you happy as this ""filler episode"" of a game has no relevance in the long run of the series. However if you have never played a Bioshock game, great news this isn't really a Bioshock game anyway.\"

It turns out that this is partially true, in that one character (Elizabeth) is memorable, as is the gimmick of a floating city and dimension-hopping. However, the rest of the story is blah, and all ends aren't satisfactorily resolved by the ending cinimatics. Is this a relatively good story for a shooter? Absolutely. Would the story stand on it's own as a book or even a movie? Never.But back to what I liked about the game: the power system works pretty well, in fact it is probably the best  thing about this game (a megaman-like dependence on exploiting enemy weaknesses becomes important in late game or high difficulties), and the combos feel powerful, as do purchase-able upgrades. Which speaks to another positive: you cannot afford to buy all the upgrades. This means finding out what your play style is and sticking to it, which is a glimmer of integrity from the increasingly erratic 2K Games.What sucks? Well, for starters there are FREQUENT framerate issues on a high-end PC, as well as game-breaking occasions where enemies, floors, walls, etc. are unsee-able because their skins don't show up. Is the air shooting you? It will go away with a restart, but if the autosave was in an inconvenient spot, you still have to play it over, aside from the obvious downside of completely breaking your momentum. I also have gripes about the story. The first 80% of the game explains nothing-which is fine, if you are playing a mystery game. Why doesn't this work here? Because the objectives you spent all that time pursuing no longer exist when you hop a reality. You end up with a Lord-of-the-Rings style question at the end: why didn't we just fly to Mt Doom (or the final Bioshock bad-guy fight, as the case may be) and skip the big nothing in the middle? Furthermore, only one characters motives are explained (Booker's, don't expect ever to find out what is going on with the twins) and many loose ends remain.SUMMARY: Was this game good? Well, the last 20% had satisfying gameplay and there were moments of greatness... I'd say it is worth playing if you can get it on sale for $15 or less. Don't expect story greatness, or even bug-free gaming, though.\"

2013,The Last of Us,"This game truly is phenomenal. Naughty Dog proves yet again why they are the kings of the PS3, and arguably gaming in general. The Last of Us gets everything right. The environments, the atmosphere, the gameplay, the storyline, the characters, the graphics. Everything. I really can't say enough how amazing this game truly ended up being."
2013,The Last of Us,"First off, let me say that this game has one of the greatest moments in gaming: The intro. If you've played the game, you know exactly what I'm talking about.Secondly, I did give the game an 8, but I totally understand why everyone is giving the game a 10. It all depends on your expectations. Are your expectations weighted more towards the playing the game? Or weighted more towardsFirst off, let me say that this game has one of the greatest moments in gaming: The intro. If you've played the game, you know exactly what I'm talking about.Secondly, I did give the game an 8, but I totally understand why everyone is giving the game a 10. It all depends on your expectations. Are your expectations weighted more towards the playing the game? Or weighted more towards going through an experience?For me, I was expecting a little bit of both, and I was very happy overall. The story, art, sound design and tension during gameplay is probably the best you'll ever experience. However, I don't believe the game is a perfect 10 for a few reasons:1. Immersion. Naughty Dog has built an AMAZING world that pulls us in right away. We get invested into it from the get-go. With an intro like that, EVERYONE gets completely glued to the game. I bet most critics went  10/10!"" as soon as they finished the intro. It's that good. However, the downside to this is that when the game contains actions that don't make sense, it breaks the immersion. Most examples of this appear in combat sequences:1a. Your companions are ignored by enemy AI. This is forgiveable, because in such a crazy messed up world, the game would be way to hard to manage everyone.1b. Joel does NOT pick up ammo in a world where ammo is ""scarce"". This is a big one. When you see every human enemy blasting bullets in every direction while you only have 10 bullets, it's as if Naughty Dog is holding up a giant sign saying ""HEY! We did this intentionally to artificially increase tension!"". It does raise tension quite a lot, but it also doesn't seem to fit the mindset of a survivor.1c. Shivs. Why does Joel craft shivs that break when being used to stab people? The guy should just own a knife! (or a machete that doesn't break in 3 hits). It makes no sense, and in the world of The Last of Us... it'd be smart to own a knife. Those of you who have played the game know Joel has no excuse.1d. Enemies are ridiculously evil. Every enemy in this game (aside from one), was a one-note badguy. They would shoot you on sight, try to kill you for ""survival"", but then they turn around and go ""You killed my friends!"" For some reason it felt like we were supposed to feel bad that we were killing them, but on the other hand... screw them. They shot at me first! The first demo Naughty Dog showed at E3 felt like they initially wanted players to feel the moral weight of what they did to players, but... It doesn't work at all with the regular enemy AI.2. Puzzles were repetitive and simple. Let's face it, there are only 2 types of puzzles in this game. Drag a dumpter/palette/shelf to act as a stepping stone... or drag a wooden plank/ladder over a gap. Uncharted had much more interesting puzzles. I understand Joel is in the modern world, but I still think a little more could have been put into the puzzles we saw in this game. However, you could also consider every combat encounter a puzzle, as strategy played a very important part.3. A lot of forced walking around and looking at things. After that amazing intro, I didn't even notice I was spending so much time in scripted walking sequences. However, upon my second playthrough, I saw that the first hour of the game is basically walking sequences with a bit of stealth thrown in. Try a second playthrough, see if you felt the same way or not.Now, with all that said... how about the positives? These are the AMAZING things done by The Last of Us:1. Story. You will love the story. Nearly everyone will love the story.2. Graphics. Some of the best on the PS3. In the game you encounter some animals, and they look amazing.3. Sound Design. Clickers are extra creepy because of the sound they make. And gunshots can scare the crap out of you if you get spotted while sneaking around. It's great!4. Tension during gameplay. During sequences with the infected (especially clickers), tension may be through the roof. The sneaking elements mixed with the way clickers work makes for a good time. Throwing bottles and bricks to trick your enemies feels 10 times more satisfying than throwing rocks in FarCry 3.5. Grenades and Molotovs! They're so satisfying to use.6. Strategy during gameplay. In the game, Joel is able to use his ""hearing"" ability (see: wallhack), to gauge enemy positions. This makes every combat sequence feel like a puzzle ready to be cracked wide open. And once you complete it... it feels gooood.Overall, The Last of Us is a very good game. However, I have the feeling most critics wrote their reviews when they were still high off the thrill of the ending. After taking a second playthrough, it's much easier to see the game objectively, and to get a better picture of how The Last of Us is as a game. The thing I find the strongest is the tension during gameplay. It adds a lot to the atmosphere. However, the atmosphere can be broken by a few design choices.Thank you Naughty Dog for another amazing game!\"

But that doesn't really do it justice.If you are looking for a brand new and unique experience, this isn't perfect, but you should play it anyway.  If you are looking for one of the best experiences to be found in gaming, you should definitely play The Last of Us.\"
2013,The Last of Us,"I really like this action-survival-horror -next generation game, forget all this MS haters...if I compare the graphics of this great game with  GTA IV, Darksiders, Mass Effect 3, Skyrim, Hitman, the action, gameplay, are matchless. It's not a perfect game, not at all,  not for all, but I like it and  it's my kind of game."
2013,The Last of Us,"This is a great game and if you own a Playstation 3 you should play it.The bad ""User"" reviews by GonzoGamer and Wilfogn  Your other review are all XboX360 games. .So my question to you is is? Are you really that stupid, why would you go and give a bad review to a game of a console you don't even have.....  You should pursuit a career in politics, you are picture perfect for the job."
2013,The Last of Us,"This is hands down the best game I've ever played. Awesome gameplay. And the story is by far the best in any game.It is also the first game ever that has made me cry.Naughty Dog gets everything right with this game. The voice acting, environment, characters, atmosphere and music is amazing."
2013,The Last of Us,"The Last of Us, its a game that needs no introduction but had to show more than what we were expecting in order to not only keep up with the current generation & next generation games coming out but also live up to the par that Uncharted 2, and Uncharted 3 set for Naughty Dog.

While keeping new ideas fresh the best thing that ""The Last of Us""  has going for it is excellent character development backed up with a truly memorable story.  So if you are able to get your hands on a copy ""The Last of Us"" is a game that you do not want to miss out, and that is why it deserves a 9.8/10.\"
2013,The Last of Us,My real score would be a 9.5 but im just rounding it up.  The graphics and story are 10/10 but the gameplay would be like an 8 for me. Also the friendly ai can get in your way sometimes but nothing too bad.
2013,The Last of Us,"A gripping story about human survival and the re-ignition of love in a bittered heart.

The voice acting is perfect, facial animations are top notch and the protagonist becomes a very 'real' person as the story progresses. The graphics are pretty much the best current consoles can offer. The art direction can best be described as 'dreary', perfect for a post-apocalyptic setting. I also love the sound design and the minimalistic sound track producing melancholic instrumental music that really gets you in the right mood. The story is thrust forward using ingame dialog sections, cutscenes and various items you find (such as pamphlets and notes). Overall, the fiction feels very 'real'. Thrillingly able to suspend my disbelief with a mature story.Gameplay:The game can be best described as a third person action adventure with lots of stealth elements, and a bit more exploration than you would expect from the creators of Uncharted. The game has a wonderful pace (absolutely not run and gun) and great stealth sections that will have you at the edge of your seat. The stealth reminds me a bit of Manhunt, in which rooms are like puzzles and it is for the gamer to find out efficient ways to get through the rooms. As in Manhunt, taking down enemies feels hefty and combat is raw and visceral. There is also a crafting system in place, in which you use recourses scattered throughout the levels to craft items like health packs and shivs. However, resources are scarce and some items use the same components. So you need to choose: do I want a health pack, or a molotov?The only downside to the game I found is the fact that sometimes your companions behave unrealistically during stealth sections, wanting to follow you around and obviously showing themselves while doing so. But it doesn't detract from the experience and luckily no alarms are triggered when it happens. Overall the companion AI is good; it is hard to make companions behave perfectly in stealth gameplay (how many games even try it?).Lastly, I recommend turning off all tips in the options menu so the game doesn't tell you what to do all the time, yet I found the normal difficulty setting challenging enough. Take your time with this one, try to find the hidden resources and be absorbed in the fiction. Uncharted 3 really was more of the same and a bit boring, this is refreshing and gripping. Like Red Dead Redemption and Mass Effect 2, this was a game that just did not bore me. 10/10 for the single player.\"

I was wrong. Naughty Dog has succeeded in crafting what is undoubtedly one of the absolute best games of all time, an emotional tour de force that, while set in a post-apocalyptic, zombie-in-all-but-name-only-infested world, spends a lot of time exploring the humanity of enduring such an environment.Some reviews have criticized the actual gameplay, but I love it. The game rewards players who can think creatively and act stealthily over those who can shoot the enemies dead the fastest. By other metrics, the game makes no compromises: for a game running on almost 7-year-old hardware, the graphics are stunning, with the writing, voice acting, art direction, soundtrack, and level design all among the absolute best in the video game world.The game has kept me greatly on edge and had me in tears less than an hour into the game. It has kept me in awe of both the ugliness of many of the areas ravaged by the events of the game and the sheer beauty of those that nature has reclaimed in the absence of meddling from humanity, infected or not.Games like this and Bioshock Infinite make me optimistic about the future of gaming. The Last of Us is a true masterpiece, ranking among not only among my absolute favorite video games of all time, but among my favorite entries in any art/entertainment medium. It's often gritty and heavy, but it greatly rewards those who enjoy deep, sometimes tragic, character-driven storytelling: the same strategy that networks like HBO and AMC seem to be focusing on with their original content in recent years to much success.All in all, if the idea of a post-apocalyptic survival game doesn't completely turn you off, you owe it to yourself to play this game.\"

2013,The Last of Us,"This game is truly fantastic. It deserves every bit of praise that it gets  but unlike other reviews I'm going to try and simply break down why. Firstly it's an action game, so it's a 1010 action game, not the greatest game of all time, out of every genre. So what's important in an action game? Action right?

Firstly it's an action game, so it's a 1010 action game, not the greatest game of all time, out of every genre. So what's important in an action game? Action right? The gunning feels more realistic than any other TPS I've experienced so far, and every weapon is so unique to handle it actually feels like you're carrying a real assortment. What about AI? Humans will come up behind you in a matter of seconds to shoot you from behind, if they can't get behind you, they will throw a molotov  at you with pensive precision. What about stealth? Clickers must be dealt with by crouching and not walking  but creeping, if they hear a loud footstep they will come charging, and on contact you will die instantly. Not only is the challenge there but it feels so nerve-racking no matter where you go. Humans can also be dealt with stealthily, choking them to do, wasting no resources, or if you choose, move past everything, like something out of MGS.  Combat  it's there as well, numerous objects can be used as melee weapons, a bat will take a few hits down someone with a combo, whereas a blade might take just one to kill. You can even reinforce weapons with blades to cause one hit kills on Clickers. hear you asking about the rest... Graphics? It's Naughty Dog, so check. Music? Does the perfect job of building atmosphere instead of sounding like a Hollywood movie  check. Story  there is nothing I can say here that won't spoil things but as soon as it gets moving there is no pointless banter, just one breathtaking moment after the next. Longevity? Yes, there are comics, artefacts and firefly dog-tags to find, numerous difficulty levels and the ability to upgrade Joel in a slightly-action RPG fashion to your liking.What I'm trying to say is that as an action game, it has it all and then some. It improves on almost all facets of an action game. Whereas others are becoming more casualized and more scripted and shorter and shorter, ND takes us in the opposite direction, with a challenging, punishing, absolutely enthralling experience that does not let up until it is over. With an original multiplayer element to boot.I hope I have given a little more insight into why this game is so praised. Also kudos to Sony for letting ND do what they want  it has paid in spades and so it should.\"

The PlayStation 3 game, which arrives in stores Friday, tells the heartfelt story of Joel and Ellie trying to survive in a world filled with death and woe. It's 20 years in the future, and the human race has been overrun by a parasitic infection that turns people into zombie-like husks that hunt other humans. There is no cure, and the goal for the few remaining humans is to survive.Joel is an experienced smuggler, an occupation that is strictly forbidden by his quarantine zone's military rule. He is employed by the Fireflies, an organization that fights against the military, to smuggle Ellie across the country. Joel isn't interested in what the Fireflies want with Ellie until details come to light that make this job the most important he's ever taken. The story of ""The Last of Us"" follows these central characters for a year, as their bond grows during their cross-country journey. This opens opportunities to not only explore the depth of these characters, but also show off post-apocalyptic versions of American locales. The trek begins in Boston and lands in Colorado and Salt Lake City, as well as a lengthy stay in Pittsburgh.Recognizable Steel City landmarks include the U.S. Steel Tower and the BNY Mellon Center Downtown, along with nods to the Strip District and Fort Pitt Bridge, but the breathtaking art is just background for the human elements on display.Joel and Ellie's storylines change throughout the game's 13- to 15-hour tenure. In a world overrun with horrific zombie-like creatures, the focus is almost always on the humans. The characters  not the infected  drive the plot. Much like ""The Walking Dead"" game and television show, the writers of ""The Last of Us"" realized that humans are much more intriguing than the mindless zombies around them. The gameplay keeps up with the presentation and narrative. Whether Joel is up against the infected or humans, stealth is key because ammunition is scarce. Quietly taking down foes is a key to success. When that fails, guns are needed, and Joel comes to acquire plenty of them. Being low on ammunition provides an added challenge to the game's combat, but that makes progressing all the more satisfying.Naughty Dog has created a console-defining masterpiece in ""The Last of Us."" It achieves the perfect balance between thrilling action and emotional storytelling. It arrived as one of the most hyped games of the year, and it delivers conclusively.\"

I don't recommend for those that don't pay attention to stories though, because Story is the best thing about this game. Buy this masterpiece!"
2013,The Last of Us,"Story/premise:  The Last of Us plot is unpredictable and truly terrifying, but it's about the two main characters, Joel and Ellie as they form a father/daughter relationship as they traverse through a post-apocalyptic United States claimed by nature. The story is dark and brutal, more so than any other game that I've ever played before. The infected in this gameis something unprecedentedStory/premise:  The Last of Us plot is unpredictable and truly terrifying, but it's about the two main characters, Joel and Ellie as they form a father/daughter relationship as they traverse through a post-apocalyptic United States claimed by nature. The story is dark and brutal, more so than any other game that I've ever played before. The infected in this gameis something unprecedented in the post-apocalytpic genre, as the humans are mutated and infected by a fungus known as Cordyceps.Visuals: The visuals of the Last of Us is beautiful and stunning. The textures are so rich in detail. Everything from the foliage, to the characters, to the world's objects are rife with details that one would think it's impossible for an 8 year old hardware to pump such impressive visuals. It might not be a huge leap from how Uncharted: Drake's Fortune to Uncharted 2: Among Thieves was, but it is certainy a leap, nonetheless. But that is to be expected from a developer that pushed the boundaries of graphics ahead of any game on consoles. It safe to say that The Last of Us in some way surpasses Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception,  many would agree this is the best looking game on consoles, and I agree.Considering how Naughty Dog used every juice left in the PS3's aging hardware, it definitely is the best looking game on consoles.Gameplay: The gameplay is as I expected. Although to some it may not be fun due to the fact that the combat is supposed to be in a way realistic. Joel is a veteran, brutal and ruthless survivor, but that does not make him a super-solider where he could aim a gun with 100% accuracy, that's not to be expected from a game like The Last of Us.Joel wobbles and has a sense of weight as he aims with his guns that he acquires throughout his journey, and that adds a sense of desperation and tension to the combat, it's really fun and challenging at the same time. But, of course, you could always improve the aiming and lessen the wobbly-ness by upgrading your skills by acquiring supplements throughout the game'sworld. The crafting system is one of the best I've ever seen in a game, it's also all in real-time, so that adds another sense of tension as you have to be careful when to craft items. Fortunately, you're able to upgrade your skills to quickly craft an item. That being said, you're not able to upgrade all of Joel's skills at one-playthrough, so this encouragesplayers to play again through the New Game Plus option that retains your skills and upgrades from the previous saved game.The close melee combat in the game is also brutal as you're able to pick up planks, pipes and hatchets and even upgrade them with spikes and barbed wires. It's effective to a certain extent, as the weapons you carried can break after a certain amount of hits than you've dealt to an enemy. The durability and strength of each weapon varies.The gameplay also gives you the option to whether go in guns-blazing, but that's kind of a bad idea as ammos are scarce or if a player prefers to play stealthly. I can say that the stealth aspect of the game is fun. Joel can go into a Listen Mode that gives a highlight to enemies near by that makes sound, that adds another way for you to plan your next move and strategize.You also have the ability to crouch this time around and the cover system is much more dynamic than what we're used to in the Uncharted games. Keep in mind that the Clickers are able to kill you in one bite, so you have to be careful, but you're still able to kill them with a shiv. Both the infecteds and the human conflicts and encounters are both equally challenging as the dynamic AI is unlike anything I've seen before.Ellie does occasionally help by throwing a bottle or brick at an enemy when Joel is in danger, she'd also come running to you to help you as she stabs an enemy to free you. The same goes to other secondary characters that'll join in the adventure for a awhile. Replayability in this game is what you'd expect from games like the Uncharted series, with a lot of collectibles to find. The game took me literally 25 hours to complete as I was scouring every nook and cranny in the game for supplies. This is definitely the longest game, Naughty Dog has ever made. Add multiplayer, and you've got yourself a game worth purchasing.Sound design: The sound design is astonishing and highly detailed in basically everything, but most of all is the terrifying sound of the Runners and Clickers that'll surely keep some players' heart pumping as they hear the clicking sound of a Clicker. Soundtrack is emotional and stunning.This game is a masterpiece and I can see why, with all the praise and perfect scores it garnered, this is one of the greatest game of this generation and probably of all time and one that'll surely be discussed for years to come. I give this game a perfect score. The ending certainly got me thinking for days, it was something unpredictable.\"

2013,The Last of Us,"After the first 3 hours or so, this game really opens up. It's boring til that point, but then becomes something you can't put down. The graphics are beautiful and the story is incredibly well-written. You feel a bond with them and genuinely want to see them succeed."
2013,The Last of Us,"Boy was I wrong in my initial review. This is by far the most stunning game I have ever played. Yes the game at times gets very repetitive (look for things  sneak around  repeat) and graphics (not design) are a bit outdated but can't really score it low because the level design, characters and game are just the best.

Otherwise the game is perfect. Best PS3 game by far. I thought Uncharted 2 would be my fond memory of my ps3 but The Last of Us gives us an amazing farewell to the current generation of consoles.\"

The whole ""scarce ammo so you have to scavenge"" thing is ruined by the fact that most of the enemies are guards, which drop ammo. The""zombies (they're zombies, don't lie to yourself)"" are generally clumped in areas and not dangerous, outside of clickers. For puzzles we have crate stacking, ladders, moving massive objects to stand on (Joel is superhuman) and motors. You'll be seeing these a lot because they're repeated more than HL2's physics puzzles. The game has stealth, which is does just as well as any other TPS game with stealth, but the AI is stupid, making it easier. It's really linear, shamefully linear. I think this is what kills me most about the game, the atmosphere is really good, ND nailed it with that, but they went NOWHERE with it. It's another linear story game that takes no risks. Walk, get into scripted scene, fight guards or zombies, cutscene. For 12 hours, that's the game. It occasionally changes things up, but that's essentially the game. I won't spoil the story, but it feels like the left it up for DLC and expansions, which is shameful. If you like really average story based games, go ahead. If you want more, maybe just rent it. It does little wrong, but even less right.\"

Sporting a compelling story and memorable main characters The Last of Us certainly brings alot to the table. There are some A.I. issues at times usually at times of tension where you have to be stealthy to avoid enemies but, your A.I. companions just carry out like like they own the place.The Last of Us is also one of the few (if not only) survival horror to include a multiplayer mode. While I haven't spent a lot of time playing multiplayer it feels like a generic team deathmatch with vague objectives.  Overall, The Last of Us is one of the best survival horror games released on the PS3 and I wouldn't mind revisiting in another iteration on the PS4.\"

Just tried and true elements that feel comfortable, though you can debate whether that's a good thing in a game that's relying on you being drawn in.   If this was a TV Show, it'd definitely be worthy of a higher score.  The story is definitely quite good.  The problem is that its about as interactive as a painting.  They went with the 'Open Barn"" design philosophy of multiple paths all leading to the same set pieces.  This can be a fine choice, but when characters react as though you'd been in a running gun battle in the set piece,  when you literally did not make a sound, it really breaks the immersion.  This type of game is award fodder, because it's easy to call good because it has a good story, and does a bunch of stuff we're familiar with, but at the end of the day, it feels like they played it too safe, and it could've been even better if they'd been willing to reach.\"

It's not great nor does it live up to the hype created around it. The graphics are very mediocre. Maybe it's just me because I'm used to FullHD resolution with AntiAliasing and Anisotropic Filtering on PC, but the game looked quite bad in some places. Low res textures, vegetation on most places is not an actual object, just some leaves painted on the texture. The game runs only in 720p which made it look even worse on my 24"" fullHD monitor, aliasing was everywhere. Additionally you can see the frame rate dropping to around 15-20 FPS, especially during some places in the cities. This makes it extremely hard to navigate and aim.Like I said, I completed the game after 12 hours and... it hanged after the credits screen. I could go to start menu but couldn't load, save or quit the game, so I had to shut down the game through PS menu. Started it up again to see what bonuses I unlocked by completing the game and... my save was gone. So yeah, I'm quite pissed off right now, 12 hours for nothing. Nice quality assurance testing there.Now, onto the game itself. The story is nowhere near as driving and immersing as the one in ""The Walking Dead"", which I consider the best adventure game I ever played. There are a few good moments, but most of the time the game play is limited to running around buildings collecting items and shooting bandits. The cut scenes are awesome, the voices and animations are really good, but there's not that many of them. I wish the story was narrated better and didn't just skip through parts. The story is 100% linear, as far as I know, there are no choices in game you can make to affect the story, so there is no re-playability value what-so-ever. In the end I never got attached to any of the characters like I did in ""The Walking Dead"".I liked the character of Ellie, although because I couldn't make any choices on how to interact with her and Joel is an a-hole most of the time, I never made that ""bond"" which would make me miss her even outside the game. Throughout the game you can sometimes stop and talk to Ellie, but it is so rare event that it doesn't really add anything to the experience, especially that you have no control over what they talk about and it's usually just small talk about surroundings or recent events. The ending is disappointing, but I guess you'll just have to figure this one on your own.Developers advertised the game with the AI that is clever and it will try to outsmart you. Ha, what a joke. The AI completely ignores your companions, they can run in front of a bandit and the guy couldn't care less. Enemies actually try to take alternative routes to get you and flank you, but most of the time they just barge into the room and stand there thinking ""now what?"". Your companions are pretty much invisible when sneaking, so you don't really have to care about them unless they are grabbed by an enemy. This made me really detach from my character and I didn't really care for my companions much.There are also some design problems I do not really understand like weapon mechanics. Shivs are used to kill the clickers, but you lose them every time you use them, like ammo. Since when are knives one use only? Same with some of the melee weapons, steel pipes go bad after 7 hits. Some weapons are badly unbalanced, like the shotgun. In later stages of the game, where soldiers have bulletproof vests and helmets it can take up to 4 shotgun body shots to kill one soldier from about 4-5 meters away. To make it more ridiculous max ammo for the shotgun is like 16 rounds.Overall, it's not a bad game, but it isn't nowhere the GOTY and I think the 10/10 reviewers didn't play through the whole game. About half way into the game I was already tired of collecting the same items over and over again and playing hide and seek with the bandits on stages clearly designed for combat (scattered objects to use as cover which are placed so obviously, upon seeing them you know there will be enemies around). I was hoping for another experience like in ""The Walking Dead"" but unfortunately I am very disappointed.Positive:+ Good script and game setting+ Awesome, but rare cut scenes+ Environments+ Animations and voice acting+ Ellie characterNegative:- Graphics- Linear and very predictable story- Lack of interactivity with the characters- Dumb AI- Some game mechanics\"

If you have $60, love Naughty Dog, and are looking for a good game to keep you going until the PS4, then go for it. This will take some time to platinum. If you're going to buy this based on the perfect 10's it's getting, I'm sorry to say, I think you will be disappointed. In the end, to each their own.....happy gaming guys.\"

I cannot believe people are trying to say this game is ""the best game ever"" and better than Uncharted 3, which was an utter masterpiece, or better than this years BioShock Infinite, which was another amazing game.  I went to the midnight launch and beat the game in one sitting so I didn't have to deal with the horrible save-game bug right now that prevents you from saving your progress, so I'm not even factoring that horrible oversight into my review.  Honestly though, save yourself $60 and put that money towards a next-gen console.  The multiplayer is also incredibly generic and unbalanced.  Whoever wins the first round wins the entire match because they can instantly afford a set of armor at the start of the next round which allows you to take twice as much damage before dying.  I'm utterly shocked by the metascore the critics have given this game.  What can you expect though, SCEA published games almost always have a full point or two higher metacritic scores than they deserve, who the hell knows why.\"

I will not be discussing the particulars of the story or game mechanics, both to avoid spoilers and to prevent this from turning into a term paper. While TLOU does manage to incorporate an average level of quality in each aspect, the game overall comes across as a dud, mainly because as I played this game I couldn't get rid of the overbearing sensation that I had already played this game's prequels and that each of these, either in their own way or as a whole, were much much better than this latest release:If you've played stealth-focused games such as Dishonored, Metal Gear, or Deus Ex you've already experienced far more advanced and enjoyable stealth mechanics.If you've played adventure-based games such as Far Cry or Bioshock you've once again enjoyed better battle and combat interface mechanics.If you've played puzzle-based games such as Prince of Persia or any other game that incorporates more than a ladder/plank combo...enough said.And by far the worst and most over-hyped category, the carbon copy mix of Zombie-Survival, Coming-Of-Age, with a dash of familial bonding, was the greatest disappointment for me, as most games I am willing to forgive almost all assuming the story can bridge the gap between a lack of mechanics and my enjoyment. In this case, for me, the gap was only widened.While I understand that all creations, particularly in the entertainment industry, rely and build upon previous ventures, the lack of creativity or any sign of originality in this game, to me, is unforgivable and undeserving of the seemingly fanboyish reviews it has received. This game is worth playing to kill some time or as an introduction to the genre if you are just entering the gaming scene, but in no way was it worth $60; wait for the GoTY edition it is almost certain to be developed into or borrow it from one of the multiple friends you have who have almost certainly already picked this up.\"

In fact, it's gameplay should be completely unacceptable in the year 2013, but the unwashed masses who bought into the console craze ""because of duh grafix!"" will throw their hands in the air and claim this and every other overhyped game like it is ""duh best game evarrr!!!"". I'm sorry but if you only play games for the graphics, blood, and story, and you don't value gameplay you are not a gamer, and I am now convinced the mainstream console audience and the audience these games are aimed at are not gamers. This game is nothing different than the same old handholdy LCD shooter we've been seeing all generation long, cover based shooting, simplistic gameplay leading you from cutscene to cutscene, checkpoints every few steps, dull brown and grey graphics, ect.

The game is also awfully glitchy considering it's made by ""The best developer of this generation"", what a  joke, can't even get the save system right, me and my friend had to play it all in 1 sitting, not like it matters because games today are so short and simple. I seriously wonder how long it will be until they phase gameplay out all together and just go back to making FMV games, or QTE driven games, because mark my word, that's the direction these amateur developers who run the industry are setting gaming up to be headed in.

But hearing \the best game of this generation\ or \the best game EVER made\ is very false to me. Let me try and help you to understand where I'm coming from:Once I have looked past the eye candy, I noticed the gameplay is very shallow and repetitive,  the infected lack variety with only 4 types and the humans have a very flawed AI which is very exploitable (also doesn\t help that you keep on killing the same 5 guys cause there aren\t that many enemy skins). The Puzzles, if you could even call them that, are no challenge at all, and only require you to push a ladder from point A to point B or drag a dumpster around for a little while so you can climb on it. The game is far too forgiving, even on the hard setting, keeps on holding your hand, treating you like a little  child, generating checkpoints after every minute and even giving you more ammo and med packs out of nowhere when you run out. It just seems overall like it was designed for the casual gamer, so parents and infants could easily beat it. In short, it offers almost no interesting challenges or compelling gameplay surprises.Now lets get to the story (which most people claim to be the strongest part of the game), its full of clichs from previous post apocalyptic zombie scenarios, and even at its best moments it never reaches the depth and feel a good movie could provide. It feels more like a budget tv-series with a very limited cast, so I really don\t understand when people claim to have cried while playing it.That all being said it still was a very enjoyable experience, which I\m glad I had the pleasure to go through. The best part about it truly where the visuals, some of the best I have ever witnessed in a video game, and the 2 main characters Ellie and Joel (even a later Villain) where some truly detailed and interesting characters which made out the main charm of the game.Video games where always about the gameplay to me, and I find The Last of Us has a lot of problems there. I think the whole \Let\s try to be a movie\ approach of video games is really getting old.I still highly recommend it to anybody who likes video games, or art in general, I didn\t mean to sound too negative about it I just wanted to express why I think gamee sites giving it 10 out of 10s is complete ****But hey, its just my opinion.\"

2013,The Last of Us,"From my perspective, and in my opinion, this is one of the best paced games ever produced. Every level has meaning and makes sense in why you are doing what you are doing. Every character has depth and emotion. Every minute of gameplay is engrossing and enjoyable. In all  an unforgettable game."

2013,The Last of Us,"The Last Of Us is a benchmark in storytelling, characters, atmosphere, and gameplay. How long has it been since we got a zombie(-esque) game with a story we really care about? Naughty Dog took a genre that had been limited to ""exploding heads and that's it"" and created a true masterpiece.I'm sure you've heard enough about how fantastic the story is, but not enough can be said about it.The Last Of Us is a benchmark in storytelling, characters, atmosphere, and gameplay. How long has it been since we got a zombie(-esque) game with a story we really care about? Naughty Dog took a genre that had been limited to ""exploding heads and that's it"" and created a true masterpiece.I'm sure you've heard enough about how fantastic the story is, but not enough can be said about it. It would be a tremendous mistake to buy this game and skip all the cutscenes. The pacing and storytelling are brilliantly done and oscar-worthy. The casting for the voice actors was done carefully, and each and everyone delivers an incredible and believable performance. And I mean that. From Joel and Ellie, to random bandits, to even the infected who can still scream incoherent phrases. Each and every character is done extremely well. The story itself is dark and unexpected. For the first time in a while I felt like anything could happen. Any character could die, there was no one who was going to make it out of this game alive for certain. And that's a wonderful thing.When you're not marvelling at the brilliantly crafted story, you're immersing yourself in a true survival experience. Playing this game on easy would be another mistake. Moderating your ammo, picking and choosing whether to engage in combat or sneak past, crafting explosives and melee weapons out of parts you find on the ground or in cupboards. It all seems so real, and so fun. There are parts when the gameplay falls a bit flat. Sequences where you need to sneak carefully to avoid clickers often results in your companion obnoxiously stomping around or speaking in a normal voice. While this doesn't actually affect you in any way, it really breaks immersion and tension.Graphically, the game comes close to challenging some games on the next gen. It's gorgeous, and has some of the best lush environments and lighting I've seen. It creates beautiful vibrant environments when it needs to, and throws you into a dark, broken, and drab world when it suits the story. It constantly reminds you what has happened to this world and never breaks the realm of reality. The character models are done extremely well too. I've never seen such accurate and realistic facial and body movements in and out of cutscenes.A small thing that's worth mentioning as well is the soundtrack. Gustavo Santaolalla has composed a brilliant soundtrack that's simple, but so emotional. They're used perfectly in the right moments and are never overbearing. It subtly creates an incredible atmosphere and it's the only gaming soundtrack to date that I have downloaded and listened to over and over again.When the story mode of The Last Of Us is done, the game is far from over. Naughty Dog put a lot of effort into an extremely underrated and unique multiplayer experience that doesn't at all fell like an afterthought. With an array of weapons, perks, challenges, and survivors to keep alive, the multiplayer is guaranteed to keep you entertained for a good while.Overall, The Last Of Us is among the very few games that deserves a 10 and nothing else. Sony couldn't have ended the generation of the PS3 any better\"

2013,The Last of Us,"I'm going to start this review by making a bold statement. The Last of Us is the best PlayStation 3 game you will ever play. The timing of this game's release, a few months before the PlayStation 4 is no co-incidence. The PS3 has had a good run, but developers have finally reached the limit with the quality of gaming they can produce, but what a way to finish.The Last of Us is set inI'm going to start this review by making a bold statement. The Last of Us is the best PlayStation 3 game you will ever play. The timing of this game's release, a few months before the PlayStation 4 is no co-incidence. The PS3 has had a good run, but developers have finally reached the limit with the quality of gaming they can produce, but what a way to finish.The Last of Us is set in the U.S.A. after the cordyceps infection has ravaged the human race, turning humans into vicious, aggressive, almost rabid-like creatures. The game follows the story of Joel, as he attempts to smuggle Ellie, who is immune to the disease, across the country to safety, with plenty of surprises on the way (I'm being deliberately vague to avoid spoilers). The plot almost resembles a movie script rather than a video game; you'll understand if you've played the game. The ending (again without giving away any plot details) brilliantly leaves the plot open for a sequel; Sony also recently registered domain names relating to The Last of Us 2 and The Last of Us 3  read into that what you will.Whilst technically a linear game, The Last of Us is probably as close to an open-world game as a linear can be; exploration, strategy and resources play a key part in the game. The combat system in The Last of Us is probably as a real a combat experience as you will get on a video game. Much like real-life, resources are very limited and weapons are very powerful. You can't simply hide from enemies and wait for your health to regenerate, instead the player must use health packs, which can be either acquired or created by the player using resources.The player can use a variety of firearms in the game, ranging from pistols, to shotguns, to hunting rifles. As ammunition is hard to come by, as in reality, players are often better off using melee weapons, such as baseball bats and planks of wood. Both firearms and melee weapons can be upgraded using parts (a resource which can be found).Resources are one of the most important aspects of The Last of Us, the player can use them as weapons, ammunition, to distract enemies, replenish their health, upgrade weapons or to access certain areas. Resources such as health packs can also be created by crafting raw materials collected by the player.The player also has the ability to upgrade weapons using collectable tools, and the opportunity to upgrade their character by collecting bottles of pills.Whilst it's clear that Naughty Dog focused on the single-play, they have included a multiplayer element as well. Like other Naughty Dog games, it's relatively poor compared to the single-player, but The Last of Us' multiplayer, known as Factions, is a good attempt. The multiplayer takes place in the same environment as the game. Players choose one of two Factions, Fireflies (in yellow) and Hunters (in blue). There are no special abilities which are unique to any faction. The player leads a clan of survivors through 12 weeks, gathering supplies in order to advance the clan. Each match counts as one day, and supplies must be gathered to supply the clan; if the necessary supplies aren't gathered then clan members will begin to get hungry, get ill or die. Clan members can then be healed by reaching the required numbers of supplies. The Factions game mode can also be linked to Facebook.To sum it up, The Last of Us will be, in my opinion, the best PS3 exclusive you will ever play, and possibly the best game you'll ever play on PS3 (the only real game that could compete with it is Grand Theft Auto V). The plot will keep you entertained for hours, and probably more.\"
2013,The Last of Us,"It's a pretty good game. Not a ""Citizen Kane"" moment by any means, but still worth playing. It's not the greatest game of the generation, it's not even the best exclusive on the PS3. It's mechanically alright with a compelling narrative that steals the spotlight from the gameplay."

Ellie is really the star of this game. she is a great, smart character and also a total badass who isnt afraid to do what it takes to survive. her protector joel who is the main player character, is a rugged badass who is tasked with escorting ellie to the fireflies. the journey is worth experiencing so many twist and turns occur which help develop joel and ellie as characters. they joke, talk, and protect each other all the way through and as joel and ellie get to know one another their relationship changes from total strangers to a father daughter relationship. kudos to naughtydog for crafting such a wonderful experience. it sure is overhyped and i dont think it should get goty (watchdogs or gta v FTW!) but it needs to be experienced by anyone who has a ps3 and likes to experience a well told story with likeable characters. joel and ellie's apocalyptic survivor story is worth the price of admission.\"

But that's only a minor fault that in no way compromises the game's overall quality. My verdict is simple: if you own a PS3, buy it. If you don't, seriously consider doing so, you're missing out something truly marvellous.\"

And its not just another zombie game, here's why. In the game you take the place of a 20 year Survivor of The Bacterial Outbreak called Ophiocordyceps, named Joel. He use to be a normal every day person with a job and a family. But since the outbreak, his life has gone to hell. We then learn about what he is been doing for the past 20 Years. He has been smuggling goods to different parts of the quarantine zone past security to make a living. All government is gone, all there is, is martial law, the currency has been changed to rations, so that people that work harder get more things, but it isn't anything to care a lot about, this isn't a world worth living in. There is little to no hope in this world. But this is where we find the little hope there is. This being the second Main Protagonist in the story, Ellie. Ellie is different and full of hope even though all the people she knew died, she is still very optimistic.  She has morals but she doesn't know any better she never lived in the world we live in. All she knows is this world with the infected and living in a permanent quartine zone. There are moments where she questions what we did in our time that she finds Weird such as an Ice Cream Truck. Her interactions with Joel portray  them as having an almost Father Daughter relationship. And there side conversations make the characterization that much better. I'm not going to say much else to avoid spoilers, as it is an experience you will want to immerse yourself in. Because the story is important to this game, and the game portrays it in a way we can all relate to in ways such as death.GameplayThe Gameplay is Stellar, it lives up to expectations of a PS3 NaughtyDog Game. Apart from the One AI glitch I encountered, the AI seems very realistic. The humans care about their lives they hide behind cover when fired at. The more brutally you kill someone the more cautious they are about running up to you. As for the Infected will run at you just trying to kill you. The Infected stop feeling fear in their second stage. the third stage, the clicker is probably the most terrifying thing I've ever faced in a video game. If they get on you, you're done for good.  The horrifying noises the infected make really add to the immersion of the game. You use an abundance of weapons everything between a brick to a flamethrower, but ammo is scarce, forcing you to craft your own weapons, and your decisions can help or hurt you, choosing between a Molotov  or a health pack is just one of the vital choices the game forces you to make. And crafting in real time always has you feeling on edge. You can also upgrade your weapons at a work bench, also hard between choosing to upgrade your fire rate our add another gun holster.Online MultiplayerThe Online is surprisingly great, you choose your load out and only get a few bullets and you find cases so you can craft weapons, like in the story. You can also buy armor,ammo, and guns in the menu waiting to respawn or in real time. The matches are 4V4 and the maps are large, stealth remains a huge factor. If you go in guns blazing you will die, even running shows you on the map. Personally this is one of my favorite multiplayers I've ever played, but it's just the icing to the cake to The Last Of Us's Story.The VerdictThe Last Of Us is one of the best games I've ever played, and it will be for a long time to come. it has beautiful graphics, along with one of the best stories ever in video games, the story isn't just a story this game, the game presents itself in a realistic portrayal of things that we can all relate to and understand such as death and the love you have for family. With addicting gameplay and one of my favorite multiplayers I've ever played, this game is truly a Masterpiece and truly is one of the greatest games of all time. I give it a 10/10\"

The story is pretty good, with two factions battling for control of America while an infectious fungus ravages America. It is well done, but not ground breaking. The game play is intense and brutal. You fight two types of enemies in the game: infected and humans. When fighting the infected, the game takes more of a survival horror. Without spoiling anything, I have a complaint about one of the enemies found later in the game. No, it's not because they were too hard, or too scary. They just felt like something that would be better put in a Left 4 Dead game rather than the Last of Us. Onto the Humans. The humans felt realistic and acted like would real survivors would react if the apocalypse really happened. Though, I felt a bit disappointed by them after watching the E3 Game play Video. It showed them more human and relate able due to more dialogue in the video. But despite this, they were very well put together. The A.I was very good for infected in my first play through. Game play overall was really good. But the star of the show is the characters. Don't expect any stereotypical characters in The Last of Us. All of them are well voice acted and believable. Especially Ellie, your potty mouthed companion.In the end, The Last of Us is an amazing game with great characters and game play.

2013,Tomb Raider,The game play is awesome.Like really awesome. Lara's characterization is amazing. Upgrade system is epic. Exploration is wonderful and challenging. And finally the story... its pretty good most of the time.I can assure u this will be one of the best of games of 2013!!!!
2013,Tomb Raider,"Tomb Raider set out to be an origin story, to reboot the franchise and it has completed that goal above and beyond. As every origin story should it provides in amazing detail the changes of Lara Croft through her adventures. Tomb Raider appeals to everyone, fans of adventure games, fans of Lara Croft and fans of video games. This reboot is a must buy."
2013,Tomb Raider,"Great game with balanced mechanics and really careful visuals.Every scenario is beautifully detailed and presents dramatic and impressive set piece moments with an interesting level structure that manages to make the linear experience feel less oppressive than the norm.

Shooting has the familiar trappings of a 3rd Person Game, but it adds some cinematographic twists here and there, ultimately being in equal parts rewarding and desperate. Parcour mechanics are also intuitive without being too on the nose.Main problem is the story arc being not too convincing, better than Far Cry 3 in this sense, yet the pacing early on seems a bit rushed. The game presents Lara as a fit, yet green, young girl that's not emotionally prepared for actual combat, yet it wants her holding a gun and shooting perfectly as soon as possible. Turns out she's a Rambo Level killing machine mowing down enemies with just a bow and a few old guns.By the end of the game she's been though so much it would make a bit more of sense... yet it's still unbelievable how a whole army of rough looking enemies now look and sound terribly afraid of this single unarmored person that has not seem combat until a while ago and now face them head on.\"

WHAT??) and russian conspiracy. After several hours of playing I found more holes in the script than bugs in the game. We talk about an ancient japanese civlization from thousands of years ago. and yet, ALL THE WOODEN HOUSES ARE STILL INTACT AND THE BRACERS IN THE FORGOTTEN SECRET TOMBS ARE LIT.I can forgive it as a gameplay license, but the gameplay is just absent.I can let go of the ""win button"", a button that shows you exactly what to do, the annoying neverending tutorial that follows you throughout the whole game or the lame experience system.but I can't let go the complete absence of anything related to a ""gameplay"".During the shooting you never die. Enemies never shoot at you, they always miss.When jumping the only thing you have to do is pressing up and A. doesn't matter if you  up the distances, the game fixes that for you.This is a game made to be won, and I can accept that if they would have presented a great story.But they didn't.And playing it is just plain boring.\"

Came in with no expectations, but was I ever wrong!Graphics are phenomenal; music and ambient sound is spooky and keeps you on edge; combat is straightforward and fun; storyline is awesome and entirely believable; character development is fantastic  the list goes on and on.The only detrimental aspects of the game are the quick time events and the GUI. I understand the QTEs make you focus on imporant parts of the storyline or keep you on the edge of your seat, but they get tiresome and really require no skill other than waiting to press a certain button at a specific moment.The GUI in upgrading weapons/skills could have been designed better. After about 30 seconds of switching through it, I quickly got a headache from all the jostling around on the screen.Nevertheless, I was truly blown away by this game. Coming from a fan of the original Tomb Raiders from the 90's, this is a breath of fresh air into what was stagnated game franchise. While it is not perfect (but truly, what games are?) it is still one of the best games of 2013. If you are on the fence about getting this game, wait no longer. Go and purchase it immediately. It will not disappoint.\"

2013,Tomb Raider,"Ok, so I was actually expecting a pretty good time from the new Tomb Raider but boy was I proved wrong. It's a bloody great time!While I do have a few gripes they are all minor things that are easily overshadowed by the sheer awesome.But for the sake of fairness let's go through them.First.

It's a bloody great time!While I do have a few gripes they are all minor things that are easily overshadowed by the sheer awesome.But for the sake of fairness let's go through them.First. The game do start off fairly weak. For the first 15-20 minutes I was certain that I they had just jacked up the drama a little bit and gone for more cinematic angles to become in essence Tomb Raider: Uncharted. However once you get through the first part and the game opens up a little I was quite blown away. The games progression is still linear but you have quite a bit of freedom exploring your surroundings and the game does a really good job at making you feel like you're not being led on rails (most of the time). My second gripe is that the game feeds you too much resources. There is quite literally ammunition every ten metres or so. It's next to impossible to run out of ammo. I really hope they release a survival mode that makes scavenging  and hunting more important parts of the game. The third gripe is the one that annoys me the most (though your mileage may vary) and it's the QTEs.I really really really hate the QTEs in this game. If I get the game over screen in this game it's about 99% probability that it was from a QTE. The game also does a really piss poor job of explaining exactly what you button you need to press and when. I must have been choked 20 times before I figured out what I needed to do.It's such a cheap way of adding ""action"" to a game and I loathe it with a passion.Thankfully there aren't that many of them but every time one comes along I'm unceremoniously ripped out of the immersion the game has managed to pull me into and I'm forced to hammer left/right for a few seconds and then hammer E or time a press of F. Gaaah!Anyway.The good parts.The enviroments are really really good.While the ""abandoned military installations on a tropical island"" setting has been done lots of times before you can understand why since it's works so good and I doubt it has looked any better than this. Every part of the island has been crafted with expert care and attention to detail. Every time I enter a new part of the map I'm always excited to see what I will find this time.The game is also extremely good at mixing the action with the exploring. I'm not all the way through the game yet but the action has never overstayed it's welcome. The pacing of the game reminds me alot of Uncharted 2  3 and that is a really good thing (don't get me started on the pacing of the first Uncharted) The story is also well crafted and keeps you interested. You really want to find out the story behind it all and see how it comes together.While the year is still young I have no doubt that this game will place on my top 10 of 2013.\"

2013,Tomb Raider,"I finally made a Metacritic account just to review this game. I am a big fan of mature, story-driven games with deep character development. Thus, I hold games like Bioshock or Witcher in a very high regard. That being said, this game is a gem. I have never been a fan of the Tomb Raider series mainly because the story for many of the games seemed overly fantastical and borderline absurd.I finally made a Metacritic account just to review this game.

I have never been a fan of the Tomb Raider series mainly because the story for many of the games seemed overly fantastical and borderline absurd. Furthermore, previous Tomb Raider games featured an overly sexualized Lara Croft who was not very relatable or likeable. This game, however, is a much needed breath of fresh air and a wonderful reboot of the franchise.First of all, the new Lara Croft is often vulnerable, but still strong and resilient. The way her personality and character developed throughout the story was just beautiful. As a player, one begins to care about the character as if she were a real person.Second of all, there is an incredible amount of detail in all of the different environments. The forests, shanty towns, ship wrecks, caves, and tombs are littered with so much visual eye-candy that it really brings the player into the game. As a history buff, I absolutely loved finding the different artifacts and also found the optional tombs and the ancient ruins to be breathtaking. This game does not skimp on the visuals.In summary, I definitely recommend this game to anyone who favors story, character development, and exploration over straight action. Although there are brief episodes of intense fighting, the focus of this game is really to tell a story that is filled with moments of mystery, awe, sadness, and grace.\"

What's awesome is that, despite being a reboot, the classic aspects of Tomb Raider that we all know and love is still very much present in this game.

The cover system itself is innovative, eliminating the chunkiness of taking cover that plagues most third person shooters. Instead, Lara blends with environments with ease. The new Lara is a huge improvement over the past iterations. The story is also stronger than the past games which gives us incentive to care about the characters. All in all, an amazing game. It's no wonder that, after 9 games, Lara is considered an icon. She is a legend. Enough said.\"

The addition of tombs make this game even more enjoyable as you figure ways to complete the puzzle. The graphics are really good and the environment and character models are top notch.

This score is purely based on the single player as i have yet to try the multiplayer because of how amazing the single player is. TOMB RAIDER IS BACK.\"
2013,Tomb Raider,"I've been a BIG fan of the series since 1996, and let me just get this out of the way, I am a Core Design fanboy. Crystal Dynamics have finally nailed it. OK  so they'll never meet the high standard set by Core, noone ever will, but this is a step in the right direction. Good for you guys, I'm very impressed. Get this game."
2013,Tomb Raider,"One word can describe this game. EPIC. As we all know, fans and haters it's probably the game, which is always more ""evolved"" than the other games. Also the graphics are AMAZING. I thought i was watching the 3rd Tomb Raider movie!"
2013,Tomb Raider,"Although I would love to be able to give Tomb Raider a 10, I never give those out unless I consider them ground breaking (like say Half Life 2 would be my standard for ground breaking) This is a good game, some may say a very good game, I'm still not sold on that idea. Tomb Raider is what really clinched the gamer in me back in 96' and so I was all ready to love this game. First the good, the combat is fun, there are some very exciting sequences (at least the first time through), the combat controls are very responsive, scenery great, sound great, acting fantastic, script good, maps well thought out and some are really fun battle playgrounds. It's fun at least the first time through. The second time not as much fun. Now the not so good. I really have a hard time with the amount of control that is taken away from the player, esp. in the first hour and a half of the game. This annoyance occurs at other moments through out and at key moments. That last part really gets me. The result of this is that you lose all sense of strategy."" How do I survive that guy with the turret? what with me being all confined in this bottle neckish map? no worries, my dev gods are powerful, they will handle it for me. As a matter of fact they love me so much they hold my hand in the worst of times, no brain needed, just quick fingers!"" Sigh. I love strategy, esp the old days of Lara looking at a room and saying to herself, ""hmm, how am I going to get up there, and how many times will I break my neck?"" I want to die five times trying to figure out how to get that guy in the turret dang it! Its my right as an avatar! oh well. key moments....it's Tomb Raider just not my tomb raider and yes I'm your mom, so it's not your mom's tomb raider. It's like Resident Evil, but it's not Resident Evil, it's a dev gods wet dream of Resident Evil. If you catch my drift. Fortunately, it's no where near as oppressive and QTE controlling as RE6, but it goes in the same direction.   Another just slight annoyance was occasional aiming or camera problems but nothing too significant, it may cause you a bad injury or death in one or two maps if you don't change position quick, but no big deal. Finally, the ""exploring"" needs to be addressed. I put that in quotes because, well here is the definition 1.Travel in or through (an unfamiliar country or area) in order to learn about or familiarize oneself with it. 2. Search for resources such as mineral deposit. I think of the first, they think of the second. Tomato, tomato. The exploring is basically bs. in my mind because there are no new locations or interesting things to find. The tombs are so meaningless,The puzzles are more than elementary and the payoff is like opening a treasure chest, finding paper money and as soon as you touch it, it dissolves in your hand.  Just nothing there. Come on guys! I would be happy with a samurai statute and say collect all of them and display them like Shepherd's ships or something! Instead you give us...uh, what do we get? blah. But okay, all in all it's great story for a great gal, with great action. A movie really with some gaming fun worked in. I like it, a lot, I might possibly buy it when they price goes down, but right now I have to return it to redbox so someone else can have some fun and so I can play the ME3 Citadel dlc, I think it's almost downloaded now...see you there boys!\"

Overall: Had this game been a bit bigger, longer and harder it could have been perfect. The visuals are some of the best I have ever seen on the 360 and I know the PC version is even better. New Lara is totally believable and I look forward to her next game.\"

2013,Tomb Raider,"Extremely well done game, polished with superb visual side. This one is a mix of Far Cry 3  Uncharted with some RE4 feeling.

The switch from lock on shooting type to the new TPS style system works really well, each encounter with your foes is very brutal and engaging. Absolutely love the graphics  the landscapes are amazing, with stunning visuals  mountains, watefalls, rivers, caves and villages. With each new location you want to stop and just look around and admire the views. This game will keep you all the time at the edge of your seat, pushing you to play for hrs and just looking forward to see what will happen next. my score is 10/10\"

But this game is just on another level and can be easily compared to Uncharted 2 in quality. Yes, it is that good"
2013,Tomb Raider,"Every action fan has their favorites, among games some that hit chord with that thought include Batman: Arkham City, the Uncharted games, and maybe a tint of Far Cry as well.

The thing with Tomb Raider is that it's like a hot fudge Sunday of all of those games, but still gets it own identity. The atmosphere is nailed, it's dark, even the lighter parts aren't too uplifting. We're in a realistic world with realistic physics and survival is key. The lighting is tremendous and only attributes to that atmosphere. The world is massive and abundant in resources, initially overwhelming but as the game goes on it's something you want to explore as you get new gear. Lara is a riveting character and as the game progresses you get to see every side of her from her first kill, making difficult decisions, killing animals for her survival, with a gain of remorse, and so many others. Gameplay is tight and responsive, nothing revolutionary for an action game but it has familiarity to it and style. The story is decent, you get engaged enough into the game to want to know what's coming next. Unfortunately the multiplayer, while decent, feels very tacked on. Stick to the single player mode, that's where the meat of the game is. Again everything in the game feels fantastic and I love to play it, it's not revolutionary. There's something to the game where even if you're not bewildered by everything, you're glued to the screen still wanting to continue though and that's what makes this game shine.\"

I found most things it does in this game are done better in other games. i found the exploration better in far cry 3. I found the shooting mechanics better in gears of war. The climbing was better in uncharted. Plus the story was a decent attempt and enjoyable but was not at the heights of uncharted 2. The characters were the biggest let down though i found them way too cliche. I've seen them done in so many other games that i only cared for Lara herself. If it was her by herself this game would off been a lot better. But overall the game really has good moments and is good if you want mechanics from a vary of really excellent games. It's mechanics are just not as strong as those games mentioned. ill rate Tomb Raider and 8/10\

The weapon upgrading system is clever and add more visual flare as you upgrade your bow, pistol, shotgun a rifle. The use of only four weapons should be a hindrance, but they are designed in a way that make you interact with the environment.

Right from the get-go, this game takes a gamble on a whole new ""reboot"" and isn't scared to put the emotion or SOUL as you will, back into Lara Croft we knew and loved.  Seeing her younger is already refreshing.  She naieve yet determined, scared, yet trying to survive every second of the game...Literally!!  If you don't think Lara is a pure BADASS after playing this game, you need to get your head examined; I have never seen ANY character go through so much punishment in a game before and STILL, run, shoot, jump, and simply SURVIVE every situation she's in.  I'm sorry Nathan Drake, you've just got pwned...by a girl!!  BRAVO to you EIDOS!! Thank you for creating such a memorable, wonderful, heart pounding, emotional, and rewarding game that I have been waiting for such a long time out of Lara!! Long live Eidos! And long live Lara Croft!!!P.S. to Eidos:  STOP TRYING TO BE LIKE UNCHARTED AND DITCH THE MULTIPLAYER!! ITS HORRIBLE!-Peace Out!\"
2013,Tomb Raider,I went into this game not knowing what to expect. Tomb Raider game mechanics have been stale since the PS2 version. How refreshing this reboot is! It looks gorgeous (as does Lara) and plays equally as good! It doesn't hit the heights of the Uncharted series but comes close. Overall this is a great reboot and I look forward to Tomb Raider 2 on next gen.
2013,Tomb Raider,"I wasn't getting my hopes up with this game,but to my amazement the game is simply brilliant. I haven't had so much fun with an adventure game since Uncharted 3! The graphics are polished, especially the pc version. There are loads of white knuckle moments, which makes me kill Lara on purpose just to replay them over and over. So far the best game this year for me."
2013,Tomb Raider,"Brilliant game, wonderful graphics, sound and detail.  The remaking of Lara Croft is handled extremely well.  It borrows from Uncharted, just like Uncharted took and ran with the original Tomb Raider.  If you like a good story, quite a bit of exploration, with a dab of puzzling and action, this is a game for you.  Welcome back Lara."

Now, mind you, I love the Uncharted series, but especially when it comes to combat, namely gunplay, this game ANNIHILATES it. This is partially because of the new cover mechanic, and partially because an M rating gives developers more freedom to accurately depict violence.  The puzzles are great, as long as you ignore the giveaway hint system, and figure them out on your own. The pacing has adrenaline at a constant high, and have a surprising amount of variation. Story is great, as long as your not easily turned off by a slightly cheesy supporting character or two. All in all, this is the first adventure game that has truly felt like an adventure worth taking.  This game game certainly holds the adventure game throne, at least until The Last of Us comes out.\"

These issues should not leave a negative feel. Every game has them. I can see a lot of people complaining about this cause the Tomb Raider series has a strong impact on the gaming world already and making this jump is certainly different. But times change and games change so all I say to these people is ""Deal with it"". My biggest problem in the game story is actually the final 4 words of the game. Too many games, movies and stories end the words ""I'm not going home"" and it gets a little annoying. With the multiplayer aspect, I can't really say much as I haven't played it much. But what I have played it appears to be well balanced, smooth flowing and contains well designed maps. All in all, Tomb Raider is an amazing game and and I certainly recommend anyone to pick it up and play through it. You will not be disappointed.\"

Also for those who complain about it being to easy all you have to do is increase the difficulty. Story wise this game nails it again. The story is action packed and exciting. The story is structured very similar to the TV show Lost. Another point I'd like to make is that this is my first Tomb Raider game so I am not bias. Although this reboot has made me a fan and I hope Square Enix has more planned. FYI, if you are looking for a multiplayer game this is not it. The campaign is amazing but the multiplayer is lackluster. Also if you dont want to get this game because the protagonist is a woman... then good luck getting a girlfriend.\"

It fits nicely into the adventure action game niche; assassins creed type,  but has its own unique identity, making it feel very fresh and new.A very good reboot to a franchise I never much cared about, it's very cinematic but doesn't remove player control to make it work.  Well worth the buy, I highly suggest it."

Also when some wolves where coming at me, they stayed slow motion for about 3 seconds. EXTREMELY EASY (and i struggled with the older games) and there's no guns so far. There is no point playing a game if your going to be told what to do, the LB button just tells you everything to do, where to go and what to find... THIS IS SO STUPID, you play the game because you want to play it not to have it practicably done fore you.

The graphics are smooth and fluid with not a load screen in sight, the visuals are very good and well polished with lots of nice scenery the audio keeps pace with the action. The controls scheme is natural and lets you make the most of each area without having to manhandle your controller as long as you pay attention and keep up with Lara, as direction changes rapidly and when you least expect it. The pace is quick most of the time and not forgiving if you get distracted off screen. The puzzle element is not as strong as previous games; it is more obvious and not nearly as complex. Character upgrading in the form of weapon and equipment upgrades is measured, evenly paced and eminently more enjoyable with stealth or shock and awe assault options in almost every situation dependant on playing style. The games storyline is in tune with earlier games, carrying the archaeological/ supernatural elements forward well and while not the obvious highlight it does make you curious as Lara self narrates as you ride on her shoulder. The developers have taken the best elements of several of the best games in this genre and blended them into this game to make it utterly an enthralling experience. That said the game is serious, and for more mature games, should Lara die or fall you see her expire in a very gruesome and confronting manner each time  this game pulls no punches and is well worth the money.\"

As someone who has been a lifelong TR fan ever since i played the very first game in 1996 this certaintly is a much welcomed upgrade from the stale games circa 2003  2008. When you compare it on the Tomb Raider scale it is very very good but on video games as a whole it lacks substance.I found immersion very difficult, considering you fall and land on an iron spike impaling your side in the very first level then not 5 minutes later proceed to run, jump and climb objects as if you had already healed from the spike almost instantly, she even holds her side because of the pain! I guess walking is painful but climbing and running... not so much. This is not the only time this happens in the game we are supposed to be believing she is human in this reboot right?.Another thing i was dissapointed with was that they once again included quick time events in cutscenes, I can't be the only one who hates this? Watching a cinematic cutscene whilst constantly being primed to press a button just ruins the entertainment of it, instead of watching the action you're reminding yourself which button your finger is on so that you'll be ready. Let the game be the game and the cutscene be the cutscene, don't merge both into some anxious attention diverting gaming moment. Let us relax and watch the cutscene or let us play that part of the freaking game!!The actual story is pretty decent, could have been better but holds together well. The combat is 3rd person and i will agree it doesn't have many flaws, the cover system holds well and the enemies have decent enough AI to be a challenege at certain areas.I love games with looting systems in place, whether it be crates, enemies or treasure chests gathering loot and supplies is fun and i'm glad they included it in this game, However looting the same crap over and over again becomes repetitive and boring, but there wasn't really anything else in this game to be looted, no armor upgrades, rare ability boosting island remedies, unique weapons etc etc.The levels whilst they promote non linearity are infact linear, there is no exploration on any large scale. You get a sort of mini sandbox to explore which i felt was lacking as we were sold this huge island. I played this game for 8 straight hours before giving it up for good, the levels and challenege felt the same throughout the whole game. There was no mission where i thought ""Hey, this is different!"" maybe except the sneaking to avoid guards and the huge amount of bodies of WW2 soldiers in that bunker with the guardian.Am i expecting too much from this game? Well not really if you're going to class this as the best game ever or game of the year. I feel my review is fair, it's definitely not 1 star and it sure as hell isn't 5 stars, which doesn't change the fact this game to me is a letdown. If you Want a proper jungle exploration shooter? pick up Far Cry 3.\"

Sassy black chick serves as the critical voice to all the Lara\s concerns over the islands supernatural qualities. Cute Chinese girl functions as a plot device by being kidnapped like athat guy who always disappears in The Hangover films. Large framed and even larger hearted Hawaiian guy keeps everyone\s spirits up while the island\s indigenous shower them all with fire based projectiles. The supporting cast is a too wide and nobody gets enough screen time or engaging dialogue to make a real presence, the main protagonist included. Lara isn\t well fleshed out either. She displays brief turmoil following her first kill, but she soon goes on to find new and outlandish ways to expose the inner craniums of hundreds more men without showing any further remorse or having the excuse of being drugged up to the eye balls like Far Cry 3\s Jason Brody. The writers attempt to book end the narrative with mournful references to her dead dad, but everything in between reads like the script of your average cookie cutter action flick.A lot of the narrative\s credibility has been tied to the portraying of Lara in a vulnerable light, but this doesn\t instantly make for thoughtful characterizing. If someone rewrote Mansfield Park and recast Fanny Price as a busty gun toting whore I doubt it\d be met with such appraisal, or perhaps it would; Pride and Prejudice and Zombies did alright, but I digress. While we\re talking literature, it\s worth mentioning that Tomb Raider attempts to embellish it\s narrative with collectable diaries and documents  la Bioshock, but they don\t embellish it so much as contain every scrap of what could have made this story interesting. Additionally they\re so monotonously voiced and lengthy that players are like to harvest them for xp and swiftly move on. In further regard to the vulnerability aspect of Lara, it\s a tone that fails to resonate when she\s brushing off twenty foot drops every few seconds like some sort of human bouncy ball.Average writing aside game play isn\t particularly jaw dropping, not to say that it\s altogether poor as it functions fluidly, but remains uninspired. The box art is tag lined \A survivor is born\ although survival elements are sparse. An opening tutorial has Lara murder and cook Bambi for nourishment. Later a heavily injured Lara has to abandon aggressive modes of combat, instead making use of throw able objects, bow kills and takedowns. However such scenarios were gimmicky and fleeting when instead they could have been more intricate and permanent features.More often or not oppurtunities to employ stealth are scripted and conclude with forced fire fights in which players need to hunker down in the same spot to pick off foes from behind cover. You can\t give a player the option to approach combat in their way for so long only to snatch it away. That\s like being invited to a dinner party where the first two courses are comprised of lobster and caviar, but turns out that desserts a massive un-optional  sandwich.A.I isn\t too intelligent, take out one enemy by yanking him with rope and arrow from a platform and his buddy two feet away will assume they\ve went for a spontaneous paraglide session. Enemies endlessly gravitate towards flammable barrels like they were full of winning lottery tickets and the island\s rigged with more explosives than a Wile. E. Coyote cartoon so combat soon becomes pretty, but stale.Environments make impressive use of vertical spaces, but routes for dispatching enemies are persistently linear. Camera angles are occasionally an issue in woodland areas resulting in the player\s view being obscured by more shrubbery than if they were being tea bagged by a tree beard from Lord of the Rings. Woefully enemies can make better use of the vertical spaces than the player during combat and anytime the opportunity to perform impressive manoeuvres arises the game has the nasty habit of cutting to a cinematic or QTE, alarmed that the players satisfaction levels may be spiking.Out with combat, tomb raiding is optional activity and when the \tombs\, read \small caves\, are encountered they\re usually preceded by long needless crawls towards an area containing remarkably simple puzzles. The purpose of these is supposedly to give the player a long look at Lara\s arse so there goes you feminist angle.The undeniably present lack of free will displayed in the game\s set pieces leads to the theory that it may have been Crystal Dynamic\s wish to produce a Tomb Raider movie. The abundant use of slow motion, cut-aways and the way the screen goes film noir when Lara takes damage would certainly suggest so. This in mind here\s the alternative to buying the game. Watch one of the old Angelina Jolie films with controller in hand and press the trigger every time Lara wastes some guy.\"

Very flawed, yet abnormally good at some few parts. The art direction is great  most of the time  sometimes it's very brown and grey and ugly. Other times the green trees and fog is delightful. The graphical quality is average  not good not bad. The animations are a mixed bag, though, with Lara's animations (while exploring) being very smooth and fluid, while during combat and ""cinematic"" set pieces they look blocky and bad. The combat is quite boring, and there is a lot of it, detracting from the whole emotional ""a survivor is born!"" storyline. Yeah, more like a raging killer one woman army sodier is born in the first 15 minutes. This makes the entire story falter, not that the already annoying and stereotypical cast of characters and predictable enemies and plot twist at the end doesn't. I mean really, ANOTHER Drake's Fortune plot twist? Overall the game is just very strangely built. It feels like the story and gameplay department didn't work together and then combined their parts at the very end. It's like making a hamburger with a hot dog bun on one half. The combat is tedious with subpar shooting mechanics, the platforming is satisfying, the puzzles are good, the story tries but fails, and I'm not even getting started with the horrendous multiplayer they shoved into the franchise. This is not the game we expected: no openness, no survival whatsoever, and no mature dark theme.\"

I found myself having to repeat QTE's over and over because the game couldn't recognize the control stick being mashed.   (I checked, it's not the controller)  Also there is no crouch button so I found myself being shot to death constantly seeing as you cannot choose when to crouch, and the game decides for you.  This is especially annoying when trying to take cover behind a waist high wall.  The y-axis will also become inverted at random and changing this in the menu doesn't do anything, you will have to restart your game to fix this.  There are also times when things don't make any sense at all.  Like you pull something down and it goes through the floor.  When you look down the heavy object is no where to be seen, it just vanishes somehow.  The main thing that kept me playing this until the end though was the combat.  It was always satisfying to execute enemies no matter which weapon you are using.  This isn't really interesting though until you start unlocking the executions.  So overall, I think it's fun.  It's just the controls are so screwy and cause so many unnecessary deaths.  So it can get frustrating very fast.\"

However, the graphics and story do save the day and make the game at least worth a playthrough but perhaps not a purchase.  In regards to the QTEs, anyone who tells you that QTEs in this game are limited after the first 2 hours is LYING. The usage of QTEs is pervasive, sometimes cropping up in the middle of high action sequences. They ruin the flow and are frequently buggy. QTEs are great once in a while but far too many games, including this one I'm sad to say, are overusing them in lieu of better engaging design.\"

When you get your order and take your first bite, something just doesn't taste right. It's bitter and not at all what you expected. This is a bit what Tomb Raider felt like for me. I went into the game with high hopes but was left feeling like the game could have been SO much more. Don't get me wrong, it is a good game. It looks beautiful and the environments are believable. So much time I think was spent on the motion capture cutscenes and the breathtaking graphics that not as much attention was given to the gameplay that needed to be. The character movement is clunky, the gunplay is just as clunky if not more, if a jump is mis-timed by a small amount, Lara will sort of float onto what she needs to grab onto. Tomb Raider is more of a missed opportunity than anything. Because of the bad gameplay, I just can't recommend this game. I bought the game Tuesday and as I sit here writing this review now on Friday (took me just 3 days to beat the game!), I can't help but feel I have been a bit ripped off. There is zero replay value in the game. Once it's beaten it's done. Over. This game is a good weekend rental, not a buying worthy title.\"

To do so, you have to do a whole lot of slow crawling through cracks, slow climbing, slow swimming under stuff and through water...out of caves, etc. My little brother was watching me play that part and asked me how it was. I told him the truth, I said ""it's boring right now, very boring...but this is just the opening sequences, so I'm sure it'll pick up after I find my crew"".I was wrong...Turns out the entire game is finding your crew and being stuck on this island. Meaning the environment never changes, the tasks never change, and well...there are a whole lot of very long cut scenes that do most of the work.As for action, I could probably count the number of bullets I used on one hand. I spent a lot of time trying to upgrade my weapons, for the best gameplay experience. And turns out it was a waste of time. The upgrades are there just to distract you from the fact that you're not doing much of anything in the game. Finding paths to certain places and whatnot isn't tough, and there are a few ""puzzle"" type moments that are not difficult at all (by 'not difficult' i mean compared to a game that exists in the same world as the very challenging puzzle game ""portal"").All that is really left to do is explore the world and find stuff, right? Well, no, not really...you run out of special abilities to upgrade to, and one is an ability that reveals every cave entrance/diamond/pretty much everything on your map for you. And when you're running around it makes stuff glow on your screen so you can find it, too...taking away the need to explore. So what's left to make the game enjoyable? Nothing...Overall this was the single most boring game I've ever played. The cut scenes were intriguing though, I'll give it that...even if they were very very long. And it's nice to see Laura become the Tomb Raider we all know and love. But, if they really wanted to make a cut scene oriented origin story, then I think they should've just made an animated series instead and then released a 'real' game for us to play.\"
