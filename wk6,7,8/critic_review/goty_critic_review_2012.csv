Year,Game,Review
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,"No multiplayer game so cannily captures a feeling of cat and mouse, and relies so completely on tension and suspense instead of yet more thrills. To call this multiplayer unique doesn't do it justice. If you care about new experiences in videogames, if you want to see how games can explore 3D spaces without resorting to shooting stuff or breaking things, you owe it to yourself to try Assassin's Creed multiplayer."
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,"Quite simply, one of the greatest stories of this gaming generation has just released its greatest chapter."
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,"With a campaign offering anything up to 70 hours worth of gameplay, not to mention a comprehensive multiplayer mode, Assassin's Creed 3 is one of the most complete action-adventure games we've ever played. Connor is a wonderful character and the perfect centerpiece for a riveting story that spans hundreds of years when you factor Desmond into the equation."
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,"Assassin's Creed III is a beautiful, sprawling adventure that proves to be one of the most, if not the most, ambitious titles ever created. Just when you think you have it figured out, an entirely new element is introduced that enriches it further, rendering it one of the least repetitive experiences to be had with a controller."
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,"Assassin's Creed III lets you jump into an intriguing point in history, and it succeeds on nearly every level with nimble combat, fun diversions and the chance to captain your own ship. Connor might not be an altogether likeable hero, but the New World he's fighting to protect is one you won't forget."
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,"There is so much story, so much multiplayer, and so much stuff to do that your average 10 hour game should be terribly ashamed of itself. In this economy, you can't do better than Assassins Creed III."
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,"I never used to get chills playing a videogame, not the way I would watching some epic movie scenes or reading an incredibly engaging book. That has changed in the last few months and this game has set the benchmark."
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,"From new game play elements like the naval battles, the expansive frontier, new multiplayer modes, and the smoothest combat to date, any fan of the franchise will not be able to put this down and newcomers will be awe-inspired by the world laid out before them."
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,"An overwhelming experience in its own right, Assassin's Creed III is the crown jewel on an already excellent series, and it sets the mind reeling about the potential for where the story goes from here."
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,"Assassin's Creed III is a fantastic game that's marred only by a glacial few opening hours, a surfeit of history and exposition, and the odd glitch. That aside, ACIII is a triumph and the perfect way to say hello to Connor."
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,"While it's a little slow to get going, Assassin's Creed III is a rewarding, elegant game on many levels. It understands that everyone plays open-world games differently, and provides plenty of incentive for players to tackle its quandaries how they see fit. The sheer variety, overall quality, brisk pacing, massive amount of content, and satisfying story make it easy to forget its few rough spots. Heady and well-informed, Assassin's Creed III is the polar opposite of a guilty pleasure."
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,"Assassin's Creed III is a pretty damn fine game. It loses none of what makes the series fun with the translation to another time and continent, and creates a whole new set of experiences which define the franchise. The biggest issue, if there is one, are the small technical issues, but these niggling technical issues only seem worse because everything else is such a great experience."
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,"Like any game of such scope, not every part of it is perfect. Yet, taken as a whole, there is very little that can compete with its wonderful, lavish, historical playground. [Issue#91, p.22]"
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,"Thus, as an Assassin's Creed game AC3 is the most ambitious yet the most refined yet; it is almost unmatched in density of content and unique in setting."
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,Assassin's Creed 3 is a massive game and also the best game in the series to date.
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,One of the best games in this franchise and a great source for many hours of fun.
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,"Though Assassin's Creed III isn't quite the perfect killing machine, it's a damn good one, and a game that definitely lives up to the hype."
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,"A hugely successful sequel, that's as surefooted as its hero when it comes to handling its enormous scale and near endless range of features."
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,"Assassin's Creed III is a huge game. The new gameplay mechanics created by Ubisoft are mostly a success, granting tons of fun with the most complete chapter of this popular franchise. A few technical problems and scattered issues are simply not enough to ruin this great experience."
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,"AC III successfully fulfills fans' expectations, satisfyingly bringing to and end the main plots open in the previous games and introducing some spectacular news over an already rich play offering. We would have liked a less rushed storytelling on Desmond's side with more action missions, while the historic setting could prove to be not as charming for European gamers; it's however a great new episode in Ubisoft's series and a sure must buy."
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,"Connor's adventure is an excellent one. His story is methodical and meticulous, much like the land his people inhabit. A slow build-up may deter players, but plenty of memorable moments are worth sticking around for. The game is so rich with content and minor activities that it's almost impossible to tackle it all."
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,"Assassin's Creed III is an amazing game, period. Tons of stuff to do, tons of animals to hunt, the magnificence of the Frontier and the pleasure to sail and be a privateer makes this game the best of the series so far."
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,"Assassin's Creed III might not be as revolutionary in itself as the historical period it covers, and it still has some shortcomings that may annoy old timers of the series and newcomers alike, but its generosity, the unbelievably high quality of its writing, particularly the character of Connor, the political and societal questions it weaves into its Templar / Assassins storyline, and the overall generosity of its content more than make up for it. It may feel constricted inside our current hardware, but manages nonetheless to push back its limits, combining the proven formula with new gorgeous elements both in the solo and multiplayer aspects."
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,"The biggest and richest Assassin's Creed game to date - maybe not the best, but a place where, for want of a better expression, everything is permitted."
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,"A marvellous return, but a few quibbles hold it back from being the new pinnacle of the series. [Christmas 2012, p.78]"
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,"Assassin's Creed III is definitely a step backwards for the excellent and popular series. The main plot is decent and the assassination action itself good as always, but the main character is totally uncharismatic and the gameplay a dull repetition of old rotes. The game world is indeed huge, but sadly it's filled with uninspiring busywork like trade caravans and a pointless crafting system. Assassin's Creed III is still a very good game, but disappointing as it could have been so much more. [Nov 2012]"
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,"Ubisoft continues its upward trend with its golden goose of a series. It brings a deeper amount of gameplay, story and enjoyment to the mix with Assassin's Creed III. It's certainly not perfect, but it's good enough to be considered for 'Game of the Year'."
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,"Overall, Assassin's Creed III is an excellent addition to the series. While there a number of bugs and the protagonist isn't someone players will feel particularly attached to, the lengthy campaign, the range of objectives and the well thought out multiplayer ensure there is plenty of replayability to keep gamers occupied. This is a title that should be on every Christmas list."
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,"Surprisingly there are graphical issues that are very noticeable and I really thought that there were some gameplay missteps that could use some retooling in the future; however, in the end this is another great addition to the Assassin's Creed series."
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,"It's a great AC experience for sure, but it doesn't really offer anything you haven't seen before (outside of the fantastic multiplayer component). Likewise, it won't entice any non-fans, which is a shame - this would have been the perfect opportunity to do it."
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,"The only real problem (apart from the weak main character) in Assassin's Creed 3 is that there are so many things to do, but very few feel satisfying. There's a whole range of side-missions and challenges on offer, but at the end of the day completing them doesn't bring anything truly useful to the player."
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,"It's a flawed gem, but still well worth a look."
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,"Assassin's Creed III is a really good AAA game that sucks you in after a brief contact. Unfortunately there are some things missing, and minor flaws can be observed, and those things prevent me from considering Ubisoft's new game as something truly extraordinary. It has everything a game from this series should have, but after watching the end credits there's a feeling that something is lacking. Assassin's Creed III isn't such a big step forward, as AC II was for the original game. In sum: it's very good, but it could be better."
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,"There's a certain amount of diminishing returns on the mechanical evolutions made but the fresh, authentic setting along with a brand new protagonist go along way in rekindling the fire."
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,Not everything about the game gels together convincingly and the missions' unnecessary prescriptiveness sometimes undermines the sense of freedom that the rest of the game works so hard to create. But it achieves so much that you can't help but respect it; no other open-world game has ever given us a setting that's as impressive to observe or as full of things to do as this.
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,"Bottom line: does the game live up to AC II? Well, no. Ezio's grand introduction is pretty damn hard to top, at least in terms of story content and franchise innovation. But that doesn't invalidate Connor's journey by any means. Assassin's Creed III's newly refined gameplay and incredibly rich setting are captivating stuff, and we're excited to see what adventures lie ahead for our new hero."
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,Other games stimulate emotion with manipulative music and teary monologues; Assassin's Creed III rouses your mind and your heart by giving you a glimpse into its characters' souls and letting you judge them on their own merits.
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,Open-world history lesson ¡V this is the area where new Assassin excels. But embrace yourself to a long survival and linear game opening. [Dec 2012]
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,"Assassin's Creed III's methodical world-building and wealth of clever gameplay systems are impressive, even if they don't always confidently click together with all the other moving parts."
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,"If you're willing to go off and do the optional activities, then Assassin's Creed III's single player really shines, and there's just so much content here that even despite the negatives, it's well worth your time. Couple that with another consistently excellent multiplayer component and you're left with a game that may leave you frowning on occasion, but nonetheless one that still has a lot of fun on offer."
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,"It's possible to lose days in Assassin's Creed 3, although if players stick doggedly to the campaign, they'll clock in about 20 hours. On top of that, there's a multiplayer ¡V and for a game where the focus for most of the fanbase will be the single-player, this one's actually rather good."
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,"Assassin's Creed 3 is a fitting end for the series and - to an extent - this generation of consoles as a whole. The characters and story are the strongest yet, but at the same time the game comes with all of the franchise's well-known strengths and weaknesses. So, even though this might just be the perfect finale, the next generation of assassins definitely will have to be more willing to refine the series' systems from the ground up. Then we'll happily listen to their brilliant stories some more."
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,"It's not easy to identify with specific characters as a result, meaning (despite their historical origins) they can feel throwaway because they don't stick around long enough to grab your attention and tickle your curiosity. That's not to say they're poorly written, there are just too many to make things feel cohesive. I guess what I'm trying to say is that sequences in Assassin's Creed 3 tend to feel like episodes of a TV show, rather scenes from a movie."
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,"The narrative mix of historical facts and fictitious involvement of the main characters is more believable than ever. The new engine has its flaws but paints beautiful vistas while presenting more detailed characters than its predecessors. But even though this is a package loaded with content, it is far from perfect and lacks connection between all the interesting ideas."
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,"This sense of restrictiveness filters through to ACIII's mission design. There are surprisingly few assassinations here, and relatively little freedom to plan an approach to them. It's mostly eavesdropping, tailing, chase sequences and battle scenes."
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,"Assassin's Creed 3 has a host of issues that pop up throughout the game, issues which by themselves have been enough to drag other titles under. But there's so much good in Assassin's Creed 3, it's so ambitious, so singular, that I can't stop thinking about it, and what's more, Ubisoft may have finally cracked the riddle of inventive multiplayer that doesn't rely on a large playerbase to enjoy."
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,The strongest aspect of ACIII is the more mature moral tone.
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,"Not the masterpiece we were waiting for, but still an impressive action game with superb art direction."
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,"Assassin's Creed III capitalizes on its historical setting in ways few other games do, hitting several perfect notes and even throwing the best curveball in recent memory. As a crescendo piece, it misses the mark completely. Occasionally iffy controls and a few mystifying design choices also knock down an otherwise solid effort."
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,"Assassin's Creed III is different to the titles that have come before it. It's an open-world game with strong stealth inclinations, rather than a stealth game set in an open world, and for Ubisoft to manage this delicate evolution without entirely alienating an existing core of stealth gameplay enthusiasts is a remarkable feat."
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,"There is a thin line between telling the player a story and letting them experience it, and it's one the previous games parkoured along with only the occasional misstep. Assassin's Creed 3 however, falls flat on the side of telling you its story - and it would be unforgivable if it weren't for the billion other things you can do in the game."
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,"Cohesion (or lack thereof) is the main issue with Assassin's Creed III. There are dozens of secondary elements which make up the content of the game, but they offer little in terms of reward and rarely contribute anything to the Assassin/Templar conflict. While the game is often quite fun, beautiful to look at and empowering to the player, it doesn't offer much challenge beyond the endurance necessary to complete all of the single-player campaign elements."
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,"Through a turmoil of assassinations, naval battles, Freudian conflicts, pig herding and marital ceremonies, Assassin's Creed III ends a saga in a way that many could judge as unsatisfactory. AC III is a flawed and confused game characterized by the absence of a clear identity and the lack of a true vision about the Assassin Order. It remains a big game with plenty to do, even though not knowing exactly why you have to do them."
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,"What it does do well it does with confidence, but uncharacteristic issues prevent it from being top of the class."
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,"The most extensive installment of the entire game series brings a spectacular adventure filled with land and sea battles. It's great to look at it and the traditional sandbox is just fine' however, this third volume's many very important qualities of the entire game series along with its game system have been lost without the new features making up for it. The less, the better, and look before you leap should have been the proverbs of the day. Assassin's Creed III is undoubtedly a very good game, but I cannot shake off the feeling it could have been much much better."
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,"It's indicative of Ubisoft's approach, so wary of the player discovering their own enjoyment, or missing key information, that it so fervently handholds through what should be its most spectacular moments. At times this reduces entire chapters to tediously long treks between cut-scenes, a lot of which feel like less than worthwhile narrative additions. It's an odd occurrence of a game giving and taking away in equal measure."
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,"This is a quite beautiful game at times: attractive, detailed, and beautifully lit. The soundtrack is less noticeable, though the main theme, with driving rhythms and a strident melody that recurs in other tracks is an instant classic. But ultimately the quality of the mission design has taken a huge nosedive from the series peak of Assassin's Creed II."
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,"It's sad to see the game lose sight of its assassin role-playing ideals in favor of bombast, bomb blasts and pig herding, so I hope this is but a momentary stumble while the franchise regains its balance. Trim the excess, remember the central thrust (hint: it's with a knife) and then you'll have a great game again. Assassin's Creed 3 is the kind of game that's just good enough to make you wish it was better."
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,"As a whole, Assassin's Creed III feels lacking. Considering how positive most early impressions were coming out of E3, perhaps my expectations were set too high, but there are clearly a number of disjointed elements that feel half-finished or poorly thought out. This is the issue of having so many cooks in the Assassin's Creed III's development kitchen, and the final product ends up being far more disappointing than I would've expected. It's not without some merit, and it's not something to skip if you're invested in the universe or overarching story, but if you found your interest waning with Revelations, AC3 could be the final nail in the coffin for some players. It's worth a rental, but I wouldn't classify this as a must-play game."
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,"At least the petty indignities of the multiplayer are optional and situated around gameplay that's solid and unique, if frustratingly stagnant. In the single-player campaign, however, it's impossible to escape the ham-fisted manipulations of the Assassin's Creed III development team."
2012,Assassin's Creed 3,"Far from the revolution we were expecting, a shift in focus to simple, repetitive combat, overly-scripted missions and tedious sidequests has for now killed our interest in a once genuinely great series. [Dec 2012]"
2012,Dishonored,Dishonored is put together so well and executes its ideas in such an expert way that it would be difficult to not recommend the game to the highest degree possible.
2012,Dishonored,"However you choose to approach Dishonored, it's a game that asks you to think, plan, be smart. It's a wonderfully empowering game because of this, as you lurk in the shadows knowing the powers you possess and the options you have. It's elegantly designed to make the most of those tools, but isn't afraid of changing the rules in order to keep its (admittedly quite predictable) story bubbling along."
2012,Dishonored,"This a game without the bloat of the modern blockbuster ¡V no co-op mode to allow two friends to assassinate hand-in-hand; no lip-service multiplayer to distract the development team and divert their budget; no upgradable hub to grow or furnish; no open world to impress and weary. Rather you're given a series of handcrafted missions, each with its own optional twists and turns, each with a start, a middle and an end, the plot written by a designer, the script penned by a scriptwriter and the narrative transcribed by you."
2012,Dishonored,"Dishonored, like Thief, or Deus Ex, is one of those timeless games you'll play a dozen times. The game world is gorgeous - a steampunk City 17, the story is spectacularly written and almost depressingly dark and the gameplay is wonderful - either as a stealthy game, or an action fighter... or anywhere in between. Dishonored is all about giving - it gives you the weapon, it gives you the name, and then it gives you the choice - vengeance is entirely up to you."
2012,Dishonored,"Dishonored gives you a beautiful, fascinating, new world to explore, and then makes it your playground for grand misdeeds. Its story of political intrigue and betrayal is told at exactly the right pace, balancing information with action in a way that keeps you interested, but not overloaded."
2012,Dishonored,"Dishonored is a sublime, unforgettable experience that any gamer absolutely needs to try."
2012,Dishonored,"A rare kind of game that waltzes into a field of debonaire company yet wows the room regardless. You may not know much of his past or even what his intentions are, but you'll be damned if you don't let him take you for a spin around the room. And at the end of your dance, he'll leave you dizzy and giddy, wanting only for more...One of this generation's best efforts."
2012,Dishonored,"So does Dishonored stand up on its own two feet? It most certainly does! On the surface it is easy to compare previous games we have loved, and it is easy to see similarities in style and gameplay, but these are elements that have clearly been learned, honed and enhanced to make Dishonored a title that lives high up in the rooftops of being one of my favorite games of 2012 so far."
2012,Dishonored,"Brilliant. It's perfect for its proposal, and creates a universe that leaves us hoping that this is just the beginning of a great series. It won't give you something really new, but it's different from what we're used to playing in this generation, which is worth appreciating. A game to remember."
2012,Dishonored,"A dark and amazing game: Its atmosphere, gameplay and artistic work come together perfectly. Dishonored is just a masterpiece, and no action-fan should miss out on it."
2012,Dishonored,"We love Corvo Attano, we adore how Arkane did it. Dishonored is one of the best experiences of stealth coupled with a sense of completely open and free superpower, in a beautiful world that is a masterpiece. Essential."
2012,Dishonored,"Dishonored is this year's must-have new IP, with fresh ideas, plenty of charm and inventiveness, and tying them together in a stylish fashion. Who said creativity in the games industry was dead, huh? Dishonored says hello. Your free time says goodbye."
2012,Dishonored,"A really surprising game, characterized by the great freedom given to the player and the high tension it can induce when crawling in the shadows. We would have liked a lengthier story, but it nevertheless remains a must-buy."
2012,Dishonored,"Dishonored is an essential purchase for the self-respecting lover of videogames. The game offers an intelligent and exciting experience which makes this one of the best games of the year. Dunwall is just as impressive in Dishonored as Rapture was in BioShock, and the magic powers are incredibly awesome to use. Eventually there is nothing to criticize this game for. A true must have."
2012,Dishonored,"It's also one of the prettiest games of recent years. The art direction is nothing short of incredible, and it's matched with a visual aesthetic that makes the world look like an oil painting in motion."
2012,Dishonored,"Precise and elegant systemic design engenders an absurd degree of player agency, but is marred somewhat by a sloppy, unconvincing narrative and soulless characters. [Dec 2012]"
2012,Dishonored,"Surely not your average first person shooter. On the contrary, Dishonored uses stealth in a way only the Thief games have managed to do and delivers a superb steam punk experience we haven't seen in many years."
2012,Dishonored,Adventure and stealth fans should definitely have this title in their video game libraries.
2012,Dishonored,"It's an intelligent game, but also one that acknowledges that action needs to feel satisfying and brutal, just as much as stealth needs to feel tense and crafty."
2012,Dishonored,"With great freedom of choice and and one of the most fascinating settings in modern gaming history, Dishonored is one of the best experiences of this late 2012."
2012,Dishonored,"Dishonored grants us a first look at the future of free-flowing gameplay in the triple A segment. Even though it stumbles over its own freedoms here and there, it still is an absolute winner of a game."
2012,Dishonored,"While it has a few quirks here and there, Dishonored delivers on almost every admirably/crazily ambitious promise made by its creators. Its impeccably crafted gameplay and exquisitely haunting and detailed world stand in loving tribute to all of the iconic and acclaimed franchises that inspired it, and yet it still has a soul and style all its own."
2012,Dishonored,"Though it's got its problems, Dishonored is a damn good game, one that makes use of a compelling storyline and wraps it into strong first-person gameplay, and a presentation that's pretty hard to beat."
2012,Dishonored,"Arkane deserves an applause just for trying this broad approach of choice, and when both design and playability builds an excellent synergy I can't do anything but to bow down to for being probably the best game this fall."
2012,Dishonored,"Bethesda made a risky gamble with Dishonored, but the result proves to be brilliant. Sure, it's not perfect, but Dishonored is one of the biggest (and nicest) surprises of the year."
2012,Dishonored,Some slight technical issues mar an otherwise extraordinarily fun game with equal parts stealth and action.
2012,Dishonored,"Dishonored is an evocative game. Even without knowing the pedigree of its key developers, you won't fail to spot similarities to the angular black steel of City 17 in Dunwall's quarantine barriers. The European twist on old London is true to the concept art, and what the textures lack in up-close resolution, the world makes up for in grand complexity and generous options."
2012,Dishonored,"Dishonored is truly a gem in a field of sequels and ""me-too"" titles flooding the market. It is a new IP developed with a lot of the conventions of game design in mind. From the beginning the game draws you into the world and never lets you go."
2012,Dishonored,"Innovation in video games is coveted by many but rarely achieved-Dishonored has this in spades. It may not be perfect, but what Arkane Studios accomplishes is astounding for a debut of an original IP. Its memorable characters, striking game world, and incredible seamlessness between combat, stealth, and magic set a new standard for the action genre. Dishonored is unquestionably Game of the Year material."
2012,Dishonored,"A brilliant example of how to blend gameplay, narrative and setting. Highly recommended."
2012,Dishonored,"Bravely uncompromising in terms of the freedom it offers the player and its willingness to go against current trends in gaming, Dishonored is adult video-gaming at its best."
2012,Dishonored,The incredible variety of ways you can engage or evade your enemies makes Dishonored impressively flexible and utterly captivating.
2012,Dishonored,"By harnessing the best design qualities of titles such as Deus Ex, Thief, BioShock or Ultima Underworld, Dishonored would have been a good game. By adding a unique world with a singular taste, carefully crafted storytelling and a solid plot, and allowing for numerous variations and random parameters inside all of that for an even more personal experience, it's gone all the way to becoming a superb game, one that is a vibrant success, and clear evidence that only video games can make us live such experiences."
2012,Dishonored,The plot may be straightforward but the level of detail in the world could inspire countless fan fiction stories.
2012,Dishonored,"What makes Dishonored great are the mechanics made possible by the universe in which it exists. There is a level of replayability and creativity available here that isn't seen in most stealth action games. You aren't just figuring out how you need to get from point A to point B, but how you want to get there."
2012,Dishonored,"It's the big intellectual property that comes to retail and shows up the competition by being bold, original, and -- more importantly -- brilliant. Easily deserving of its place among the BioShocks and the Borderlandses, Arkane's aggressive, non-aggressive, unsubtle, sneaky, thoroughly versatile tale of intrigue makes for the kind of game that reminds us this generation isn't all straightforward shooters and ""me too"" trend-seekers."
2012,Dishonored,"The open-style missions--combined with the weapons and abilities--make a thrilling playground to explore, tough enemies present a significant challenge, and the multiple outcomes, characters, and setting create an exhilarating world to discover. Dishonored is a game that you won't want to miss."
2012,Dishonored,"Arkane Studios has crafted what's likely the year's best new IP, and by tapping into elements of so many of this generation's greatest games, this adventure sneaks up, grabs you, and won't let go."
2012,Dishonored,"Dishonored succeeds as an ambitious game not content to take one thing and do it well. It demands more than most games ever will of its player, and gives more to players than most other games will ever manage."
2012,Dishonored,Dishonored mixes the dystopic worlds of Rapture and City 17 with the assassination-for-a-cause gameplay of Hitman and Assassin's Creed to create an experience that actually feels more original than it probably should have. Both the setting and the gameplay work well and had Dishonored been better in a few more areas it could have been a contender for one of the best games of the year.
2012,Dishonored,"Though I was frustrated by the chaos system and how it steers your actions, the heart of Dishonored is about being inventive, adaptable, and ruthless. The team at Arkane Studios has injected an array of cool possibilities into the simulated city of Dunwall, and discovering them all is a blast."
2012,Dishonored,"Dishonored goes out of the way to encourage freedom in how you approach your obstacles, and it plays the long game, offering up layers of experimentation."
2012,Dishonored,"Dishonored could well have been the fourth installment of the Thief series, but there are also traces of BioShock and Half-Life 2 here and there. If you compare it to these paragons it's a bit disappointing, but it still shines among this year's games. [12/2012, p.60]"
2012,Dishonored,While I did find some disconnect with the main character I found the game did a remarkable job at telling the story and setting the stage for Corvo's relentless pursuit of those who set him up. The amount of character interaction in the game is impressive and the experience can go as deep as you'd want it to go.
2012,Dishonored,"Dishonored is an amazing game, but has its lesser moments. The ingenuity and creativity that can be used by the player is nothing short of spectacular at times and the steam punk style fits the world perfectly. On the other hand the developer could have spent more time on storytelling and the game has some technical faults. Because of this Dishonored never really lives up to its full potential."
2012,Dishonored,"What is there is so compelling that the lack of additional stages can't help but feel like a disappointment. The game's strengths are a double-edged sword. Regardless, this is still one of the best games of this year. With a bit of work, a potential sequel could be one of the best games of any year."
2012,Dishonored,"Dishonored is a really great video game. I enjoyed the gameplay a lot and the story and world are interesting, if occasionally flawed. It's certainly one of the more interesting games released this year and everyone should at least consider picking it up."
2012,Dishonored,"Thanks to the variety of abilities and phenomenal level design, you can in many ways tackle Dishonored as you feel fit. It's a bit impersonal at times, but most elements of the game work really well."
2012,Dishonored,"For its soaring highs and captivating hits alone though, Dishonored comes as an easy recommendation. With the Thief franchise stuck in a lab somewhere having numbers spliced into its title and Deus Ex still on the naughty step after those boss battles, Arkane has come good with arguably this generation's finest stealth title and a game so lovingly crafted that it begs to be played."
2012,Dishonored,"Dishonored is a good game. It falls flat a bit on the pacing, the AI has a laundry list of quirks that become frustrating real quick, but on the whole the game delivers an experience you won't find anywhere else this year."
2012,Dishonored,"Despite the game's myriad achievements, Dishonored never really rises up to the greatness of its potential. Arkane Studios' effort isn't quite as clever as it needs to be: it doesn't really build up to anything momentous, or have anything special to say, and it's particularly galling to see a world that's been so painstakingly created not live up to its potential when it comes to narrative and context."
2012,Dishonored,"This is a muscular and confident game, one with the utmost faith in its own fiction and a dedication to gameplay satisfaction at a microscopic level, paid off in dozens of situations that feel completely random and organic, even when they've clearly been planted there for you to find. Tighter control and a more generous approach to replay value would elevate Dishonored to true classic status, but it stands as one of the year's best all the same."
2012,Dishonored,"An excellent game, and one worthy of your attention. Dishonored's greatest contribution to the genre games like Deus Ex helped establish will be best appreciated by those who've been with it from the start, but Arkane has made a game rooted in manipulating artificial intelligence that plays just as well to the guy or gal who wants to shoot stuff. That's impressive."
2012,Dishonored,"Vastly entertaining but highly derivative, Bethesda's latest effort perhaps isn't the behemoth of originality that some expected it to be, but still it is a game that every fan of stealth-oriented action/adventures shouldn't miss."
2012,Dishonored,"Dishonored is never able complete that transformation from a game into a totally new and exciting world to inhabit. To be sure, our mostly positive rating reflects that this game is well-structured with all the pieces you'd expect and story flexibility will offer up a unique adventure for every player. It's a promising and mostly enjoyable start to what will perhaps be an ongoing series, but it lacks the emotional punch that could make it great."
2012,Dishonored,"After my first playthrough (which took around 6 hours), I felt a bit underwhelmed. As in I literally thought to myself - that was it? But then after going through a few more times, I realized how fun taking different paths could be."
2012,Journey,"An ethereal, innovative, emotional cooperative experience, thatgamecompany¡¦s Journey is one that any PlayStation 3 owner should take."
2012,Journey,Journey is really an amazing journey from start to finish.
2012,Journey,"Journey is incredibly short - you'll finish in about two hours - and it's not really all that challenging in the traditional gameplay sense. But it will be meaningful to you in a way that a bigger, louder, flashier game won't."
2012,Journey,"There is nothing to keep you coming back for more besides the absolutely exquisite environments, the very-clean interface, solid controls, and Triple-A camera cutscenes."
2012,Journey,"Journey is a marvel, a hallucination of gameplay that feels as deep and immersive as the borderless desert where it begins."
2012,Journey,I haven't been more captivated by a video gaming in years. There were moments in Journey that I stopped pushing the directional stick because I was too busy taking in my character's surroundings. Should you play Journey? Yes. You should play Journey. Right now.
2012,Journey,"Certainly a game that offers up aesthetic beauty, both in its visuals and score. But where it truly shines is in the experience of playing it. In Journey, the mere acts of jumping, running, and sliding around a painstakingly crafted world are enough to invoke strong emotional responses from the player. Every element, every mechanic, every single little thing works in seemingly effortless concert to deliver a game that is experientially beautiful from surface to core."
2012,Journey,"Journey's visual and sound design sets new standards for interactive entertainment. This alone makes it an extraordinary work, but it's the way that these aesthetic elements come together with beautifully subtle direction and storytelling to create a lasting emotional effect that elevates this to one of the very best games of our time."
2012,Journey,Games that summon up emotions from a cold son of a bitch like me are incredibly rare... Journey had me grabbing the box of tissues by the time it was over.
2012,Journey,"After playing Journey, I couldn't get it out of my head for days. Journey goes left, where every other game goes right; the game is a crafted experience that has been built with such care and attention that it easily transcends the label of ""game"" and expands into a broad, delightful experience."
2012,Journey,Journey stands head and shoulders above all other artistic games. It's truly avant-garde and pushes the boundaries of what a video game can mean to its audience.
2012,Journey,"Miss out on Journey, and you'll deny yourself one of the greatest gaming experiences on any platform to date."
2012,Journey,Journey is the surprise of the year. It is also a must-have title for everyone thinking that virtual worlds are meant to be more than just a playground where they would while a couple of mindless hours away.
2012,Journey,When games take it to the next step and become art!
2012,Journey,Journey is a different game that everyone will love. If you like videogames you must play Journey. It is a very special experience you will never get enough of.
2012,Journey,"Journey is something that purely relates to who we are and what we are, an experience that will give you as much as you give to it, that needs to be absorbed and processed."
2012,Journey,"From the first spec of sand to the last flake of snow, developers thatgamecompany have managed to get more emotion and more life into a video game than anything else in recent memory; and the striking confidence that the game exudes drags you along for the ride without once letting you go, until the credits roll by two or three hours later."
2012,Journey,"I don't want to be misconstrued as generic or uninspired when I say that Journey is an awesome game. In the most classical, archaic sense of the word, Journey is a beautiful, evocative and unequivocally transcendental experience."
2012,Journey,"Journey isn't a game - it's an experience. The few hours that this complete gem contains are completely breathtaking, and cement Thatgamecompany's status as visionaries."
2012,Journey,"The fact that Journey has so effectively condensed the experience into a two-hour interactive poem is an astonishing achievement. It is the evolution of Jason Rohrer's art game Passage, bringing an unmatched humanity to the experience through its multiplayer."
2012,Journey,"Experiences like Journey don't come around very often in any form of media. thatgamecompany's crafted an interactive tour de force that's triumphant in its ability to cycle through human emotions. It's a game that demands your involvement on a spiritual level, rather than a purely mechanical one, and while it's never preachy in its philosophical intentions, it's hard not to get wrapped up in the divine nature of Journey's tale."
2012,Journey,"It's one of the few games you'll genuinely reflect on after completion, and an object lesson in how less can be more when it comes to crafting narrative and eliciting investment. This is a game about which I would change nothing, and I can't remember having said that too many times before."
2012,Journey,"Even though it's only two hours long, you won't forget playing Journey anytime soon. And more importantly, you won't regret it: this game is absolutely gorgeous, complemented by simple, but incredibly effective gameplay. If you're a gamer with some form of self-esteem, you'll pick this up as soon as possible."
2012,Journey,"Journey transcends conventional gaming and becomes more of an interactive experience designed to evoke (not force) emotional responses through subtle imagery, sublime music, and the perfect balance of adventure and discovery. It is easily one of the best games I've played this year and one of the top 5 PSN titles of all time."
2012,Journey,"Yes, there have been experiences like Journey before, but it has been far too long since we've seen one."
2012,Journey,"If there was ever a game deserving of the word beautiful in it's description, it's Journey. The game is stunning to look at, satisfying to play and oozes atmosphere from every angle of its dynamic story and immersive world. Sure it's short by regular game standards but Journey is not a regular game. If your ready for an experience that will surprise you, move you and stick with you for many years after its done, then maybe this is the Journey for you."
2012,Journey,Anyone who loved Team Ico's games or thatgamecompany's other efforts like fl0w and Flower will love this ¡V it's easily worth the $15 asking price.
2012,Journey,"It might sound like like an exaggeration, but it's not - Journey makes people stop what they are doing and then it holds them in its thrall, making them sit down to watch in silence (barring the occasional exclamation.) When I played it towards the end of an entertaining Saturday night, my living room slowly filled up with my roommates' guests, none of them saying anything, just sitting and watching. If thatgamecompany ever decides to take over the world we will all be in trouble."
2012,Journey,"Great visuals, wonderful audio, varied gameplay, interesting idea for internet co-op and remarkable atmosphere make this Journey unforgettable. [April 2012, p.68]"
2012,Journey,I can ramble on about Journey for pages and pages on end but nothing I say can really explain the delight of such a game.
2012,Journey,"A mesmerizing and extraordinary experience. It successfully taps into the deepest parts of ourselves, allowing us to simultaneously reflect and explore."
2012,Journey,"Some will be disappointed by how quickly the game ends, but the two hours that mark your journey is the most incredible and unique you can possibly have on your PS3."
2012,Journey,"The game is mighty abstract, but it's through this abstraction that it finds it greatest power. I feel very strongly that game designers don't latch on to enough mystery and narrative obliqueness; Journey is out there; its expression is magnificently visual and deceptively interactive."
2012,Journey,"Its approach to control, cooperative play, failure, exploration, and gratification are fundamentally novel and indifferent to its peers. These deliberate alternatives might seem unwieldy because we keep implicit rules reserved in our minds, but Journey's pretends none of them ever existed and still manages to treat its audience with the utmost respect. What a joy that it's a lot of fun to play, too."
2012,Journey,"Journey is a mysterious adventure game where you travel through deserts, caverns and blizzards while trying to reach a faraway mountain. Even though the game is only a couple hours long it makes up for it by being really atmospheric and original. There really aren't any other games like it. It also has quite a bit of replay value, since you can play it in multiplayer mode as well. [Apr 2012]"
2012,Journey,It still astounds me that a couple of hours of gameplay left such a profound impact.
2012,Journey,"One of the most emotionally charged gaming pilgrimages ever devised. Tiny but tremendous. [Apr 2012, p.92]"
2012,Journey,"Journey is captivating, beautiful and elegant. This game manages to be unusually engaging with its artistic proposal and unique gameplay. Absolutely brilliant."
2012,Journey,"Clever, emotive, and easily the best downloadable game so far this year. [June 2012, p.58]"
2012,Journey,"Journey is short, very short, clocking in at a little over an hour. But that hour is an hour of unique and magical experiences."
2012,Journey,"The amazing finale to the ""flying"" trilogy puts high demands on players but the reward is satisfying ¡V indescribable feelings of absolute joy. [Apr 2012]"
2012,Journey,"Even under duress, it's easy to lose yourself in this strange, enchanting world. Sadly, it's all too brief. We felt we'd barely scratched the surface when the credits rolled. Sure, there was a suitably enigmatic ending, but we wanted more. Much more. [April 2012, p69]"
2012,Journey,"Journey is an amazing achievement for thatgamecompany and it shows just how far Jenova Chen's studio has come since since flOw. The game controls like a dream, is startlingly beautiful and will be one of those games people will talk about for months."
2012,Journey,"Some will find Journey too slight and too sparse an experience to justify the asking price. And that's fine, it deliberately speaks to an audience that will fall head-over-heels for its painterly style and worthy metaphors. But whatever camp you fall into, never say Journey isn't a video game. While it is one of the most expressive and unique titles of the medium, it is a video game. A magnificent one. Embrace it."
2012,Journey,"Keenly directed and liberatingly open, Journey is occasionally impenetrable - but that's the price of mystery. A short trip, but one to cherish. [Apr 2012, p.90]"
2012,Journey,"Whether it's seen as an incomplete art object or a transcendent masterpiece, Journey is beautiful from its solemn opening to its masterful ending."
2012,Journey,"Journey is not the kind of game that you finish once and then shelve itforever. Here you play for the enjoyment of playing itself, not toreach a certain goal."
2012,Journey,"The game evokes an incredible amount of emotion from you, and it is the kind of game that its fans will play over and over."
2012,Journey,"Journey may be short, but it will leave you entranced for the entire ride. You will go from being mystified to intrigued to moved to much more. Throw out your expectations for platforming games and enjoy either the loneliness or the community in the desert of anonymity."
2012,Journey,"Journey is short. Too short. It's so brilliant, so magnificent, that you wish you could dive in its story and world for more discoveries, more wonder, more breathtaking poetry."
2012,Journey,I've never in my life experienced a better example of less is more. This game truly does take the player on a journey.
2012,Journey,"Once in a while a game comes along that makes you proud to be a gamer. It's the kind of game you want to show your parents to prove to them that it's not all explosions and fast cars. It's the kind of game that you want to tell Roger Ebert to go play after he makes inflammatory statements about how video games can never be art. And it's the kind of game that given the right platform and exposure, has the potential to resonate with an audience that doesn't usually care about games. Journey is one of those games."
2012,Journey,"Journey is a pure and decorticated experience where everything - music, graphics or interaction with other players - works together to form a perfect symbiosis.There are no highscores or leaderbords in Journey. There's just an uncompromising and personal adventure towards a mountain in the distance."
2012,Journey,"Journey is an unforgettable experience. Even when the details fade, the emotions that it evoked will stay with us for years."
2012,Journey,"Magical, impressive, inspiring ¡V like an Arabian Nights' story. The world with its monumental vistas reminds you of ICO and Shadow of the Colossus while the game design continues the mysterious experience of Flower."
2012,Journey,"Where Journey truly excels is in its top-of-the-range visuals, inventive world and its tonal breadth. One moment you will find yourself avoiding the spotlights of menacing, sentient war machines 20 times your size in a barely lit dungeon, and the next plodding through the harsh mountain peaks with almost no visibility, all accompanied by a genuine sense of dread as your character visibly starts to die and can barely walk anymore."
2012,Journey,"By the alchemy of developer thatgamecompany's skill and vision, it is also unique, exciting, mysterious, and utterly lovely, with mesmerising landscapes and stirring music. It deploys more 'gamey' elements than any of the developer's works before it, and does so successfully, while maintaining the feel of an evocative, interactive art piece."
2012,Journey,"Journey is a defiant bridge between art and game, managing to emotionally connect without being cloying, and succeeding in being mysterious without becoming pretentiously vague and obfuscating. Journey's interactive, visual, and aural elements work together, rather than fight with each other, in order to provide a flowing, seamless, influential, and utterly exhilarating experience...This is interactive art. This is how it's done."
2012,Journey,"Less is most definitely more in this beautifully understated co-op adventure, that dares you to make sense of its enigmatic voyage."
2012,Journey,"Journey is a visual stunner thanks to some remarkable sand movement technology and excellent animation work, both on the main character and the strange creatures encountered along the way. For a game all about dry, harsh deserts, the way things move in the world make everything feel much more like a vast ocean. The graphical beauty is accompanied by an equally breathtaking musical score, which responds to character actions and changes in location with ease."
2012,Journey,"Even though I often struggled to find meaning within the game's mysterious world, Journey doesn't need to be explained. It's still a fulfilling experience."
2012,Journey,"Journey's DNA consists of two intertwining strands: mystery and beauty. These two ideals weave together a wordless experience that manages to feel both familiar and foreign, which is no small feat. While this excursion through the sands may be just a brief stopover from the glut and glitz of other games' well-stocked campaigns and multiplayer suites, Journey still delivers a complete package with the artistic vision intact."
2012,Journey,"Another amazing and beautiful spell from ""that"" game company. Don't think about it... just live it!"
2012,Journey,"Altough short and not very challenging, Journey is a different and extraordinary kind of videogame, an experience you cannot miss for every other title someone could advise you."
2012,Journey,"My gaming tastes are such that I'm perfectly conditioned to fall in love with something like Journey. Keep that in mind - if you're more about visceral action or epic 40-hour experiences, you should possibly look elsewhere. But in my opinion, this is one of the best games out there that can provide you with an experience - and a memorable, highly positive one at that."
2012,Journey,"An immaculately constructed, expertly choreographed experience that tells a story in a unique, intelligent way, exploring themes of faith and fate, death and rebirth with a rare delicacy of touch. That it comes at a time where risk is routinely avoided, sent out into a landscape clouded by doubt and dominated by the safe, the tried and tested? Maybe that's the real wonder."
2012,Journey,"If Journey is about God, then God has played an awful lot of video games. One of the most fascinating things about thatgamecompany's sand-blown chunk of spiritual eye candy isn't that it reinvents gaming, or extends the medium's reach: it's that it takes old ideas - sometimes very old ideas - and repackages them in clever, stylish, and unexpected ways."
2012,Journey,"Journey celebrates the poignancy of nature, it startles you with the unexpected, and empowers you in an exhilarating, unforgettable conclusion...The hours spent completing Journey will create memories that last for years."
2012,Journey,A brilliantly executed piece of interactive design that never fails to entice and engage. Thatgamecompany's best work yet.
2012,Journey,"Its haunting atmosphere sure to leave a mark ¡V just as, say, Flower did before it."
2012,Journey,"Journey isn't a game, it's an experience. An awe inspiring experience that will give goose bumps at every other turn. You will notice soon enough when you flying through the bright blue sky accompanied by creatures that look like the love child of an octopus and a flying carpet. [April 2012, p.98]"
2012,Journey,"Journey can be a commentary on human life, a story of redemption, aparable on futility of all efforts, or, quite the contrary,perseverance in the face of obstacles ¡V even if you're not into waxingphilosophical, you will still discover your own meaning of thisthree-hour journey."
2012,Journey,"You can hardly call Journey a game, it's more of an experience. The images are hard to forget and the music is absolutely beautiful. The only disappointment is that the game takes only three hours to complete."
2012,Journey,"All you need is two hours, two buttons to play with and when you're exploring you almost always get awards. This is one of the most compelling journeys in a desert you'll ever get."
2012,Journey,Journey's worth playing for the unique experiences offered but the actual involvement with the mechanics isn't always engaging enough to match.
2012,Journey,"Journey's short length and limited replayability make it difficult to wholeheartedly recommend. It is, however, a tour de force of brilliant visuals and music, as well as a joy to play through and explore. It's absolutely worth experiencing at least once. [Apr 2012, p.78]"
2012,Journey,"Journey's real issue, if it has one, goes much deeper than that. It's a resolutely linear game in which your range of interactions is minimal. For some, that will make it a pretty but hollow novelty; boring, perhaps. But for those who play games to explore strange lands, see beautiful sights and to immerse themselves ¡V for however brief a time ¡V in a new world, Journey is perfect. And what's more, they'll find someone like them to share it with."
2012,Journey,"It mostly reminded me of some of the dull and barely interactive bits of Uncharted 3. I think the lesson here is that deserts are often poorly suited to games without dune buggies...There's no challenge and no real gameplay, which isn't necessarily a criticism. It's sort of like Shadow of the Colossus without any colossi, or Ico without the little girl."
2012,Mass Effect 3,"As a bombastic action-RPG with no previous context, Mass Effect 3 is a dark, engaging game with great combat, a well-written story, and all the epic space-opera you could want. But for those who have played through Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2, it's something much more."
2012,Mass Effect 3,"The Mass Effect trilogy will undoubtedly go down as not only some of the greatest games ever made, but may go down as one of the best trilogies ever to exist in any form of media, and for that Bioware, we thank you."
2012,Mass Effect 3,"I've never been privy to a game that caused me to wonder, question, and embrace humanity's place and purpose as greatly as Mass Effect 3. It is worth noting ¡V BioWare attempts to tailor the game for new players, yet the experience is undeniably deeper and more rewarding if you have already played Mass Effect's previous games."
2012,Mass Effect 3,"Preserving the importance of a personal story against the backdrop of a galactic catastrophe, Mass Effect 3 respects its foundation as much as it understands and indulges in the player's choices. And it does it better than anything else."
2012,Mass Effect 3,Better fighting. A great story. Amazing multiplayer. A brilliant ending and a masterpiece from Bioware.
2012,Mass Effect 3,"BioWare couldn't have provided a more satisfying ending to the trilogy. Mass Effect 3 is more a work of iteration than innovation, but sometimes that's just the right path to achieve excellence."
2012,Mass Effect 3,"With its grand storytelling and enthralling gameplay, Mass Effect 3 doesn't just bring an epic trilogy to a close, it rivals the most revered space operas."
2012,Mass Effect 3,"While there is a definite finality to Mass Effect 3, the wealth of plot-based variables are likely to inspire second, third and fourth playthroughs, not just of the latest game but of the entire trilogy. Mass Effect 3 is truly unique in this respect, leaving no stone unturned and offering full closure, yet still leaving players with countless 'what ifs'. It's these unanswered questions that have driven the Mass Effect experience, and will motivate players to see their mission through to its glorious end."
2012,Mass Effect 3,Mass Effect 3 is about as good of an ending as anyone could have possibly hoped for.
2012,Mass Effect 3,"Mass Effect 3 is brave enough to threaten to destroy its very own legacy. Everything you've worked for is genuinely at risk, and horrifying things are going to happen because of some of the choices you've made. If you've spent as long as we have with these characters, the impact of this final journey will be one you don't forget for years. Brave, thrilling, and incredibly emotional, Mass Effect 3 is a sci-fi masterpiece."
2012,Mass Effect 3,An epic conclusion of a masterful trilogy. This one has it all.
2012,Mass Effect 3,"As bleak as this story is, it's offset by war sequences so large in scale and beautifully animated that you cannot help but look upon them in awe."
2012,Mass Effect 3,"More than ever, the Mass effect universe pulls off the masterful trick of feeling huge and yet believable ¡V the game's production values are through the roof, and its third-person shooter controls incredibly precise, responsive and accurate given Mass Effect's immense scope. It really does feel like a TV sci-fi series in which you play the central character."
2012,Mass Effect 3,"As with any game that dares to be ambitious, deconstruct Mass Effect 3 into its constituent parts and of course there are flaws, but taken as a whole this is arguably the first truly modern blockbuster, a game that transcends the genre boundaries of old and takes what it needs from across the gaming spectrum in order to finish its story in the most compelling, thrilling, heartbreaking way possible. Few gaming sagas come to a definitive close, but this one signs off in breathtaking style."
2012,Mass Effect 3,"Whether you've been holding your breath since finishing Mass Effect 2 or just now looking to jump into a story-driven video game, Mass Effect 3 provides something for everyone from the single-player to co-op, it's just that f***ing good."
2012,Mass Effect 3,What is so unique in this game is how the presence of its conclusion feels like the existential dread that infuses the characters that make up its universe. The paradox of the game becomes painfully prescient as it draws inexorably towards its conclusion.
2012,Mass Effect 3,"Whether it be friends you've made along the way, or long-time companions, everyone is at risk...Very few games pull me in like this."
2012,Mass Effect 3,"Mass Effect 3 is a milestone in the history of video games. It is an absolutely fantastic end to an amazing SciFi saga and tells an absolutely enthralling story. The characters are authentic and the synchronization is great. The gameplay stayed mostly the same, though there are a few improvements in Shepard's sprinting and the cover system. The complexity of the Mass Effect universe and the variety of scenes in the game are simply stunning. This is a must-buy for everyone who loves video games."
2012,Mass Effect 3,"Mass Effect 3 is a fitting conclusion to the trilogy that manages to put the best parts of Mass Effect 1 with the best parts of Mass Effect 2. Sure, it will never be as much an RPG as the title that started it all, but as a result the game is actually, surprisingly, more fun to play and feels like a very well put together third person shooter that is bolstered by an in depth customisation system for both your weapons and your skills."
2012,Mass Effect 3,Never before has a game felt like so much was on the line.
2012,Mass Effect 3,Without question Mass Effect 3 has now become the new pinnacle entry into the trilogy by introducing a plethora of new innovations and improvements on already solid aspects.
2012,Mass Effect 3,"Mass Effect 3 is a great conclusion, fully satisfying and highly spectacular, to BioWare's sci-fi trilogy. A must buy for every lover of good games and great, emotional stories, as well as the first real nominee to the title of GOTY 2012."
2012,Mass Effect 3,"Mass Effect 3 greatly closes a trilogy that will be remembered for years. Although it is more action-focused than the previous game, the game will please fans of the series and is a serious candidate to be the game of the year."
2012,Mass Effect 3,"The storytelling itself, the more refined combat, the voicework, the visuals, et all, stand as a fine example of some of the best this industry has to offer, and with my minor complaints aside, there's no doubt that Mass Effect 3 will be deservedly at the top of everyone's list come this year's award season."
2012,Mass Effect 3,"The perfect ending to a masterful trilogy that's gone from strength-to-strength with each title. It's the conclusion you're hoping for, with each decision demanding that you think twice before pulling the trigger."
2012,Mass Effect 3,"Mass Effect 3 is an emotional rollercoaster ride with lots of tension and moving moments. The threat of the Reapers make every decision a hard one and your relationship with other characters will be tested. This, in combination with tight gameplay, makes this the complete experience."
2012,Mass Effect 3,Mass Effect 3 is an utterly brilliant bookend for an outstanding franchise.
2012,Mass Effect 3,"An outstanding final chapter for a magnificent saga, Bioware simply surpasses itself with a killer ending and great gameplay. We already miss Captain Shepard and Normandy crew."
2012,Mass Effect 3,"The epic conclusion of an amazing saga. Has some annoying visual bugs and the narrative doesn't quite reach the fantastic peaks of its predecessor, but it's still an incredible production that will be remembered."
2012,Mass Effect 3,"From the visceral combat to the excitement of finishing Shepard's 100-hour fight, Mass Effect 3 is a rare, magnetically engaging treat that'll compel you to stay up well past your bedtime to do ""just one more quest."" Safe travels, fellow Shepards. See you starside."
2012,Mass Effect 3,Mass Effect 3 is one of the best experiences of this generation. Fantastic character design and an immersive story define a game that everyone must have.
2012,Mass Effect 3,"What you'll remember when you're done with ME3 is not the glitches, it's the adventure and the characters you shared it with. As a trilogy, it is one of the most well-realized pieces of science fiction ever created. As a videogame, let's just say I hope I'm alive to see a series of this scope again."
2012,Mass Effect 3,"In many ways, Mass Effect 3 has set the bar even higher as the worthy conclusion to one of the finest stories ever told in gaming history, even if it's still admittedly imperfect."
2012,Mass Effect 3,"Improves many of the series' individual elements, and provides finality to a saga in which numbers of us have invested dozens of hours. But despite this success, it's unable to reward the effort and investment of players in the same way previous games did. Still, it handles its subject matter in a way that invites you to care, and the addition of multiplayer does add another dimension to the game. When all has been said and done, there's a very good chance that you'll feel something."
2012,Mass Effect 3,"No matter your feelings on how things turn out in the end or the addition of multiplayer, Mass Effect 3 is the trilogy-capper we've been waiting for, and its an experience that can easily be recommended to nearly anyone."
2012,Mass Effect 3,I can say that Mass Effect 3 is indeed an epic conclusion for Commander Shepard's role in the Mass Effect Universe.
2012,Mass Effect 3,Mass Effect 3 is a great conclusion of an incredible saga. No other games offer up as much as this worthy series climax with a perfect story and amazing action sequences.
2012,Mass Effect 3,"Mass Effect 3 is a fitting conclusion to one of the best RPG franchises ever. The story is gripping and gameplay-wise Bioware has fixed many of the errors they made with the second game, most importantly the renegade/paragon points work properly again and you are free to actually role play as you see fit. It doesn't quite reach the greatness of the first Mass Effect game, though. Still, a great game and a great end to Shepard's story. [March 2012]"
2012,Mass Effect 3,"A heart-pounding, exciting, tragic, daring, but blemished conclusion to Mass Effect. [May 2012, p.69]"
2012,Mass Effect 3,"In the end, though, none of this simplification really matters all that much. Sure, this smaller scope may diminish the game's scale, but it doesn't diminish its impact, as Mass Effect 3 is ultimately only slightly - and not always that noticeably - less fun than Mass Effect 2 (and is still a slight bit better than the original)."
2012,Mass Effect 3,"Thematically, the end of Mass Effect 3 and the conclusion of Shepard's story is pitch-perfect. But upon closer inspection after the fact, the manner in which you arrive at your fate - through bare number crunching and a tenuous causal link between war assets - fails to convince. [May 2012, p.55]"
2012,Mass Effect 3,"Although Mass Effect 3 may be quite far from beeing the best role-playing or shooting game out there, it certainly concludes one of the most intelligent and epic science fiction universes shown in games. As both the best game in the series and an instant game classic, this is truly an experience no gamers should miss."
2012,Mass Effect 3,"If you have played the previous games Mass Effect 3 is a must have title, and even if you haven't it's still worth checking out, even if it's just for the multiplayer."
2012,Mass Effect 3,"Mass Effect 3's job is one of refinement, and BioWare polishes its ideas to a mirror sheen. [Issue#83, p.72]"
2012,Mass Effect 3,Overall Mass Effect 3 is a pretty incredible game and a nice way to finish Shepard's story.
2012,Mass Effect 3,"Mass Effect 3 is a brilliant final, epic and extremely strong in the series."
2012,Mass Effect 3,"In conclusion, this game has not let the series down. Opinion will differ with the actual story, but with the amount of different options available in the game, that is bound to happen. It just can't be stressed enough that this game will only give half the pleasure if it is played without prior Mass Effect experience."
2012,Mass Effect 3,"Mass Effect 3 is a fantastic game and an even greater achievement upon the landscape of video game that is only held back by some small gameplay issues and its own grandeur. Honestly, the worst part of the game is knowing that there will be no Mass Effect 4 to import my Shepard into. It's like saying goodbye to a friend and it is an experience that, while sort of heart aching, every single person who plays video games should have. But it's nothing without its predecessors. So do yourself a favor, start with the original Mass Effect and see this story through to the end. There is nothing else quite like it."
2012,Mass Effect 3,The most epic trilogy of this generation ends in an almost perfect way. It doesn't matter whether you're a fan of the franchise or not. You owe it to yourself to save Earth.
2012,Mass Effect 3,"While the individual parts of Mass Effect 3 aren't perfect, the whole is a remarkable achievement. It's an adage that's true of the entire series. Each game has its flaws and do not escape criticism as standalone titles. But the commitment to the long-game reaps its own rewards for BioWare, with five years of dedication from creators and players alike coming together for a suitably heart-wrenching end to arguably the finest video game series of this generation."
2012,Mass Effect 3,"To put it plainly, there is an odd disconnect between this game and Mass Effect 2. In fact, there are more ties between this game and the first game than there are between 2 and 3, and sometimes we can't help but feel Mass Effect 2 never happened."
2012,Mass Effect 3,"BioWare has crafted a fantastic game with Mass Effect 3. The shooting is improved once again, the RPG customization is deeper, and the story missions are mostly amazing, with the exception of the overall plot ending with a big letdown."
2012,Mass Effect 3,"The technical and gameplay prowess of the long-awaited Mass Effect 3 cannot be denied. The improvements in combat, graphics, and multiplayer are definite, though that may have detracted from the last third of the game, which feels slightly stiff and rushed compared to the first two-thirds where uniting the aliens races under a common goal brings a welcome resolution. Mass Effect 3 is like a comet: It may not last as long as you'd like and its trail may not be as brilliant as its coma, but it is a sight that no one can forget."
2012,Mass Effect 3,"With a gripping story, fun combat, clever dialogue and a great cast of characters Mass Effect 3 is everything we hoped it would be: an epic conclusion to a highly acclaimed trilogy."
2012,Mass Effect 3,"While I don't think that this recent entry is the best in the series, make no mistake - Mass Effect 3 is still a really solid game that shouldn't be missed."
2012,Mass Effect 3,"While it's not a total triumph, the core of what Mass Effect 3 achieves is an engrossing, fabulously put together piece of work, regardless of an ending that will delight as many as it dumbfounds."
2012,Mass Effect 3,"Mass Effect 3 is an action game with a side-helping of dialogue, and the finale might frustrate fans who have stuck with the series since the beginning - some might even consider it lazy. It's hard to knock the actual game; it's a great shooter and the dialogue is well acted and (mostly) well-written. Mass Effect 3 is one of the best marriages of shooter action and storytelling around, and it's up to the fans to decide if that's what they really want."
2012,Mass Effect 3,"The combat leaves something to be desired, which might diminish what you get out of playing it in 'Action' mode, but what Mass Effect 3 really sets out to do - wrap up one of the best space operas of all time - it does expertly."
2012,Mass Effect 3,"A great ending to a landmark trilogy. A near perfect mix of action and storytelling, where the personal drama is as engrossing as the galaxy-spanning battles."
2012,Mass Effect 3,"Even if the end destination of this final chapter isn't quite as magnificent as we hoped for, we'll never regret the hundred-hour, three-game journey we took across the galaxy to get there. Mass Effect 3 is an incredible experience that rewards you for those years of investment and devotion to its stratospheric tale."
2012,Mass Effect 3,"The less-than spectacular combat does little to diminish what is ultimately a spectacular experience. As a finale to Shepard's quest it's fulfilling, engaging and packing enough depth to keep you very much on the edge of your seat and wanting more from the universe."
2012,Mass Effect 3,"Mass Effect's brilliant story remains intact, and if you played the previous two games, the payoff's more than satisfying. Some cover and combat issues remain unsolved, though, and the idea of participation in a completely separate multiplayer mode potentially influencing your single-player ending is mind-boggling."
2012,Mass Effect 3,"A remarkably satisfying conclusion to a beloved trilogy, and a poignant and memorable role-playing action game in its own right."
2012,Mass Effect 3,"Despite some of these glaring issues, Mass Effect 3 brings a decent and fitting closure to a long and involving sci-fi story about an epic intergalactic war."
2012,Mass Effect 3,"My hat is off to them for being able to bring this hugely ambitious project to such a satisfactory conclusion, and I hope the overall quality of this work is indicative of what we can expect from them in the future."
2012,Mass Effect 3,"I feel ME 3 is an evolution rather than the revolutions the first two games were. While the ending has certainly left a bad taste in my mouth and soured my feelings on the series a little, I cannot deny that the journey to get there is still excellent."
2012,Mass Effect 3,"The story is more fast-paced than anything BioWare has done before and still feels like it's affording the player as much time as they need to explore and discover. While some niggling issues do persist in terms of controls, the storyline is supremely satisfying right up to its climax, which contains one of the most interesting moral dilemmas found in videogames (from a standpoint of long-term implications)."
2012,Mass Effect 3,"If you've played the first two games you are going to play the third no matter what I or anyone else has to say, and you should, because Mass Effect 3 wraps up the franchise nicely and you need to play it. Everyone else can wait for the deluxe 3-game box set with all the DLC that is sure to come later this year."
2012,Mass Effect 3,Mass Effect 3 is thoroughly enjoyable and a good sci-fi romp.
2012,Mass Effect 3,"Some of the pay-offs for using a single Shepard from the first game through to the end of the third game seem thin. Not bad, just thin. Seemingly huge choices from the first two games amount to less then a full minute of screen time and an email sometime later."
2012,Mass Effect 3,"Even though it has some interesting ideas, it's hard to get excited about yet another take on wave-based survival, especially one that uses the occasionally-clumsy Mass Effect combat as its base. Once you start thinking about how most of the campaign's side content either uses these same multiplayer levels or has you performing extremely basic retrieval tasks, it's easy to start feeling slightly indignant about the whole thing...But only slightly. At the end of the day, Mass Effect 3 is a game for people who liked Mass Effect 2 so much that they absolutely need to see how it all ends. Despite claims to the contrary from the game's publisher, I really don't think newcomers will get much out of it at all."
2012,Mass Effect 3,"Here is a package that represents exceptional value. There's little here to convert non-believers, but then this game is not for them. This is one for the fans, and few who buy it will be left unsatisfied by how the story - their story - ends."
2012,Mass Effect 3,"ME3 was a mixed bag for me. In some ways, it comes off as a television or anime series that everyone likes but is forced to put up with the filler episodes for the moments that matter. It offers a confusing conundrum of powerful story elements with an impact that can only be measured against the investment a player has made into the first two games. At the same time, it wraps much of it within uninspired mechanics and an ending that is satisfying on one level while coming up short everywhere else."
2012,Mass Effect 3,"I was equally exhilarated and disappointed by Mass Effect 3, and while I mostly enjoyed Commander Shepard's final chapter at the time, I'm now left pondering everything that it could have been, yet sadly never will be."
2012,Walking Dead: The Game,"After conquering Sam & Max, Monkey Island and Back to the Future, Telltale is ready to prove that they know a thing or two about zombies. If A New Day is any indication, then The Walking Dead game is going to be the must-play zombie game of the year. Stylish visuals accompany a well written adventure full of memorable characters and genuine scares!"
2012,Walking Dead: The Game,"As an opening act, A New Day did what it was supposed to: get me interested in the next episode even if the overall universe of Walking Dead completely depresses me. It's not that there's no happy ending; it's that there's not even real respite from the horror of what's going on. And that's exactly what happens at the end of the first episode."
2012,Walking Dead: The Game,"Ultimately, my only mark against The Walking Dead is that there aren't a lot of places where players get to use their noggin. With the exception of a scene where you must determine the right sequence in which to dispatch a group of zombies in a parking lot, the game proceeds forward in a linear fashion. Sure, you can mess up and die, but the game isn't difficult, and doesn't have any unconventional puzzle solving, like those found in Telltale's Sam & Max or Monkey Island games."
2012,Walking Dead: The Game,"A New Day is an exceptional start to a five-part series that has me completely hooked and engrossed in a world that I can't even begin to imagine, let alone speculate about where it will go next."
2012,Walking Dead: The Game,Some scenes in this game genuinely moved me.
2012,Walking Dead: The Game,The Walking Dead: Episode 1 takes the zombie apocalypse and makes it a story about a man and a little girl trying to survive. It's well done with just a few odd things. It's not an action packed experience and that may turn some away.
2012,Walking Dead: The Game,"By some creative miracle, modest difficulty and interaction are outweighed by genuinely great survival storytelling."
2012,Walking Dead: The Game,"The Walking Dead may have more gore than puzzles, but by striking out in a new direction that focuses on atmospheric storytelling, Telltale delivers one their most compelling and enjoyable titles to date."
2012,Walking Dead: The Game,"I know retention is a big problem for episodic games, but I wouldn't miss seeing how my story plays out for anything, and I suspect you'll feel the same way."
2012,Walking Dead: The Game,"All in all, the first episode of The Walking Dead was a fantastic experience. Fans of a good narrative should look into this game, as well."
2012,Walking Dead: The Game,"A triumph of the interactive narrative, good proof that with good writers and a solid direction, letting the player make decisions can make a good story better. An intense game with plenty of tough decisions and consequences that come back to punch you in the stomach."
2012,Walking Dead: The Game,"Although protagonists behave irritatingly stupidly, their story is still interesting. Best Telltale game ever. [June 2012]"
2012,Walking Dead: The Game,"I have to hand it to Telltale, even though I had my doubts, they pulled this off in fine fashion. They've taken what they do best and managed to fit it to a franchise that would seem to be better suited for a different genre altogether."
2012,Walking Dead: The Game,The relationship between Lee and Clementine is handled extremely well throughout the game.
2012,Walking Dead: The Game,"It has a believable cast of characters and a great look. Sure, the puzzles some adventure gamers love are missing and there will be an audio hiccup here and there, but as an introductory hook to the five-episode series, The Walking Dead Episode 1 has just about everything fans could want."
2012,Walking Dead: The Game,"Telltale Games did a nice job in introducing the characters and the world, and in giving them depth, and while I found the gameplay elements to be a little bit easy, that might be because Episode 1 is an introduction, and the difficulty will ramp up as the season progresses -- or at least I hope so; otherwise The Walking Dead might end up being more an interactive movie than a real game. But regardless, I thought the story was strong enough to support even an easy game, and so I'm optimistic about the season as a whole will turn out. The game's $25 suggested retail price looks more than reasonable."
2012,Walking Dead: The Game,"With The Walking Dead, Telltale's experimentation with an unusual formula pays off. With its focus on dialogue choices and puzzles that more naturally fit into a narrative, The Walking Dead is a unique experience. In less than three hours, the game delivers a thoughtful, character-driven story that takes a refreshing look at the zombie apocalypse. And like any great episodic show, I'm eager to see what happens next."
2012,Walking Dead: The Game,"Despite a few fumbles, The Walking Dead: Episode 1 is a resounding success. I can't wait for the next installment, and I have found myself reflecting on my choices, pondering at how events could have unfolded differently. This two-and-a-half hour game is most certainly a love letter to fans of TWD and zombies in general, but those who've yet to be bitten by the zombie bug may enjoy the experience as well."
2012,Walking Dead: The Game,"The Walking Dead's first episode, 'A New Day', succeeds where some of their past adventures have failed not by fixing the issues that often hold their games back, but by placing a greater importance on the presentation and character work that the team handles best."
2012,Walking Dead: The Game,"Personally, I'm counting the days until the appearance of even the next episode."
2012,Walking Dead: The Game,"Great both standalone and as a gateway to a larger series. Let's hope it all pans out. [July 2012, p.76]"
2012,Walking Dead: The Game,"A slow-burn character study, some quick thinking and a constant air of menace make for a gripping start to a new adventure. [July 2012, p.68]"
2012,Walking Dead: The Game,"A New Day is more of an 'interactive story' than a true game, but fortunately it's more interactive than Telltale's previous achievements (Jurassic Park and Law & Order) and the story itself is great ¡V emotional and engaging. [June 2012, p.60]"
2012,Walking Dead: The Game,"If you love the The Walking Dead comic book or a well written story with a lot of drama and emotional insight, this game is for you. If you're looking for action, puzzles or challenge, run away from any Telltale Games adventure."
2012,Walking Dead: The Game,The Walking Dead is a fan service carried out perfectly. If you're a fan of zombies created by Kirkman this is a must buy.
2012,Walking Dead: The Game,"A gripping story, a dark, gritty comic book look, good voice over work and Telltale's understanding of the atmosphere and tone of The Walking Dead makes this a great package, and I'm excited to see what's in store for coming episodes."
2012,Walking Dead: The Game,"Despite introducing so many characters in a short space of time, Telltale has managed to plant the seeds of emotional connection; which I can only hope leads to more intense drama and difficult decisions. Its limited opportunities for interaction is probably its biggest failing beyond the bugs, but there's a lot of potential here."
2012,Walking Dead: The Game,"Its dialogue is superb and really gives credence to the choices you make, and we can only hope Telltale makes good on its promise to have these decisions mean something, and to impact the world and the way other characters view you."
2012,Walking Dead: The Game,"Bloody, brutal, and hard to put down."
2012,Walking Dead: The Game,"The game perfectly captures the most important part of the books: the tone and atmosphere. Fans of the comics will appreciate the familiar faces and places that do pop up, but even those of you that have completely avoided the stellar comics and so-so AMC TV series will be engrossed."
2012,Walking Dead: The Game,"A great adaptation of Robert Kirkman's comic, one that isn't a chore to play and is genuinely absorbing across its two-hour entirety, even with its hiccups. Also, if you're looking for the most depressing dad sim on the planet, The Walking Dead: Episode 1 is for you."
2012,Walking Dead: The Game,"I can forgive The Walking Dead: A New Day's weak puzzles and occasional technical issues because of all the other things it gets right. By focusing on moral choice and character relationships, Telltale has managed to remain faithful to the source material while simultaneously crafting a zombie game that feels fresh compared to its more action-oriented brethren."
2012,Walking Dead: The Game,"As a fan of the comics, the game absolutely nails the tone and setting. Important characters like Hershel and Glen make an appearance, and they act just as you would expect them to. The voice acting is great, and the models are very expressive."
2012,Walking Dead: The Game,"As long as you know you're going into an interactive story experience, you won't be let down."
2012,Walking Dead: The Game,Rich atmosphere compensates for poor gameplay mechanics of The Walking Dead.
2012,Walking Dead: The Game,Telltale Games reborn? Hopefully they have finally realized what their main strength is and discovered that the QTE sequences alone don't make a good game. [June 2012]
2012,Walking Dead: The Game,"It could have been enriched with puzzles and endowed with a different interface, thus prolonging the experience and branding it a full-blooded adventure game. [June 2012]"
2012,Walking Dead: The Game,"This is a must buy for any fan of the series, as the game captures its pace and tension perfectly. For everyone else, this is a good if a bit short experience that's definitely worth a look."
2012,Walking Dead: The Game,"As it is now, The Walking Dead is a good choice only for adventure maniacs with a hook for the zombies. Everyone else is advised to wait for the release of at least a pair of additional chapters and wait for our final review."
2012,Walking Dead: The Game,"It's a lot more wordy than you might expect from a survival horror, and there's fewer puzzles than a true graphic adventure, but this is the best zombie game for years."
