Year,Game,Review
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"Few games so deftly balance the contrasting qualities achieved here. It's at once both epic and intimate, earnest and lighthearted.

2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"A huge improvement over the first game, Assassin's Creed II offers up an enormous, beautiful open world that¡¦s easy to get lost in, an epic storyline and all the fun that comes from creatively killing villains and tearing across 15th-century rooftops at ridiculous speeds."

2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"Ezio feels complex and human. This virtual version of Florence feels vital and real. From the ashes of the overwrought, flawed original comes one of the few videogames that truly qualifies as an adult, mature experience."

2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"I couldn¡¦t be more pleased at the progress that Ubi Montreal made and the completely unabashed way they took the criticism to heart of the first AC. They¡¦ve lovingly crafted a set of gameplay systems that not only improved on their first entry, but also rendered it completely obsolete. The game learned from its mistakes the first time around and fought its way back to the top of the pile."
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"In conclusion, Assassin's Creed II is a worthy successor and goes beyond the original game with a very interesting story and some almost perfect gameplay."

2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"Assassin's Creed 2 is miles away form the first chapter. It's a whole new game, different in many aspects. The main quest is involving and nice to play, and the number of side mission and extra activities is impressive (and all of them are fun to play). The setting is peculiar and unique, and the panoramic views are sharp and, somehow, magic."

2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"A game that takes the free-running and huge cityscapes of its predecessor and adds in a host of action-RPG elements that combine to form a much deeper and more satisfying game, and a surprise frontrunner for the best of 2009."

2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"Assassin's Creed 2 does exactly what we want a sequel to do. It improves on the original vastly and corrects all the errors, it adds a ton more depth and content, yet it still manages to encapsulate the charm of the original."
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"Not only an unreservedly brilliant and compelling follow-up, but one of the finest games we¡¦ve ever played. Boasting a suitably grand soundtrack, majestic aesthetics and masterful level design, Assassin's Creed II is everything we could have ever wished for and so much more. Forget Modern Warfare 2, Assassin's Creed II is without a doubt this year¡¦s biggest and best."
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,You can tell that Ubisoft put an incredible amount of work into this title and the development team should be proud of what they accomplished.
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"Assassin's Creed 2 is an amazing sequel. It outclasses the original in almost every way, but in doing so only enhanced my appreciation for the original game and the foundation it provided."
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"The bottom line here is that Assassin's Creed 2 is one of the best games of this year or any other, period. The first game was great in its own right and this one is better in almost every way. Even the finale is brilliant in how it provides a satisfying conclusion to this chapter while dropping huge bombshells that demand the series continue. This is a gamer¡¦s game from start to finish, and if you don¡¦t like it you might need to consider a new hobby."
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"A massive, brilliant sequel that one-ups the original in almost every way."
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"With a more complete story, much more varied gameplay and the same virtues than the original, Ezio's adventures in the Renaissance will captivate everyone this time."
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"Despite the original Assassin's Creed's less than well hidden inadequacies, we were bowled over by the sheer ambition of the title, the daring of the setting, plot and characterisation. That this sequel goes along way to addressing many of the previous gameplay concerns, while expanding on what made the first release such a wonderful slice of escapism, leaves us convinced that Ubisoft really are building a truly vital franchise that this sequel is a pivotal part of."
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"Everything about Assassin's Creed II screams believability, from the real life characters that you interact with to the conflict ¡V it plays out as though direct from the history books. More than once while playing this game did I get that feeling of ¡§this is why I love to play video games¡¨ and ¡§it¡¦s one of the best titles of 2009.¡¨"
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,It¡¦s very darn close to perfection.
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"Forget Jerusalem and forget Alta_r. Ezio's adventure in Renaissance Italy is better in every aspect! Both Florence and Venice are enormous living cities with an fantastic atmosphere, and even the smaller cities are wonderful to walk and climb through. There is only one big rotten apple: Italy's wonderful capital city Rome is the smallest location in the entire game."
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"What happens when a dev team listens carefully to all the feedback they got from the community? Something amazing like Assassin's Creed 2! This game is so much more thorough than its predecessor, and it has so much on offer that you¡¦ll never want it to end!"
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"Assassin's Creed II isn¡¦t just a step forward for the series, it¡¦s a leap. The improvements are immediately obvious, and it isn¡¦t a stretch to say that Assassin's Creed II feels like a game two or three sequels away instead of one that was just two years from the original."
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"A sandbox with unparalleled scale, this comes close to even topping GTA IV. [Jan 2010, p.80]"
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"Needless to say, Assassin's Creed II is a game full of intrigue and mystery that will keep you engrossed from the awkward opening to the epic finale."
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"Assassin's Creed II is all the first game should have been if the authors developed more deeply plot, characters and gameplay: being able to rely on a well proven engine, they focused this time on a making the game more interactive and varied, even if it¡¦s missing some of the wow factor the first game had two years ago. A fascinating action-adventure, full of things to do and moved buy an intriguing story: a must buy."
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"The experience is layered, unique, and shows an incredible attention to detail. This is one case where the sequel has triumphed over the original by catching the gameplay up to the already excellent visuals. No matter what your preconceptions are about Assassin's Creed II, the game is well worth your time and money."
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"Assassin's Creed II has plenty of fixes and additions, but the story can drag, and the sense of awe that the parkour provided two years ago is muted. Yet new mission types, freedom from a linear quest, added depth, and a stronger historical bent fortify the overall experience. There¡¦s still no other game quite like it, and whether you dismissed the first game or absolutely loved it, this is one creed worth taking."
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"Assassin's Creed II is greatly improved over its predecessor. At the same time, it doesn't mess with what made the game so attractive to fans in the first place. The varied and refined gameplay along with the engaging story makes this title a must-buy for any serious gamer."
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"Ezio has no problem beating Altair's efforts. On the technical side there might be some problems, but Assassin's Creed II is one of the best open world games out there."
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"Simply put, Assassin's Creed 2 is a much more enjoyable experience front to back and much better put together."
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"While I was cautiously optimistic in starting up Assassin's Creed 2, within the first three hours it had it's hooks in me."
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"By being better in almost every department than its predecessor, Assassin's Creed 2 does exactly what a sequel should."
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"Manages to fix almost everything that felt lacking in the first installment. With it's stunning visuals, engaging storyline and fun gameplay Assassin's Creed II is easily one of the best games of 2009. [Dec 2009]"
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"Assassin's Creed II delivers a great story driven experience. Solving most of the problems of its predecessor, this accomplished sequel offers compelling action, beautiful environments and a great plethora of well written characters. A must have for every action-adventure fan with a taste for history, and one of the best games of this fall."
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"AC2 is everything a sequel ought to be: An improvement on the original in nearly every way. Perhaps more impressively, it actually has me interested to see where the series goes from here -- something I wouldn't have expected after I slogged my way through the original. Anyone who enjoyed the first game will definitely like AC2, but the real accomplishment is that people who didn't enjoy it will likely have a good time, too."
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"The ending is, of course, something I do not wish to spoil for you guys, but it needs to be said that Assassin's Creed 2 comes to a decent conclusion. So much so that I cannot wait to find out what the folks at Ubisoft Montreal have prepared for the franchise's next outing."
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"Assassin's Creed was easily one of my favorite games of the last decade, and I love the sequel even more. It has managed to improve on almost every aspect of the game, despite missing a couple of obvious and unfortunate mistakes. This side trip to Italy is a truly fantastic vacation and worth every dollar, euro, or gold Florin."
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"The first Assassin's Creed's charm was in the sumptuous graphics and straightforward action - that incredible climbing and free-running, and the visceral thrill of stapling evil people to the dirt with a wristblade. With AC2 the rest of the game has caught up with the brilliance of those central ideas to create a complete and coherent experience. We can think of plenty of words that could describe Assassin's Creed 2 - involving, exciting, cinematic - but there's only one word that sums it up beautifully. Killer. [Dec 2009, p.74]"
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"Assassin's Creed II is what you'd want an action sequel to be: bigger, better, and more beautiful."
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"Assassin's Creed 2 has more variety than its prequel, and it's a great gaming experience. Despite a graphics engine which is good but that no longer represents the cutting edge, the real difference is now the storyline and the gameplay. Ubisoft has listened to what people were asking for, and we are now in front of what Assassin's Creed was supposed to be."
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"The storyline is intricate, there's depth beyond the main quest, the presentation is wonderful, and the action is incredible at times. We've had some stunning single-player experiences this year, and Ubisoft has given us another gem to add to the list."
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"Perhaps the ultimate testimony is the fact that it left us longing for another sequel, something the original certainly never achieved."
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,Ezio is the evolution of Alta_r. The game shows improvement and keeps you fascinated because it offers enough variation. The graphical performance is high and the sound is just fine. This game just simply can't be missing from your collection!
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"It is not, however, a flawless experience by any means ¡V and we think the series' finest hour is still coming ¡V but for fans of the original, it's the step forward we were rooting for and just tempting enough for new players to savour."
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,Assassin's Creed 2 manages to wipe away most of the criticisms towards the previous game and delivers a gameplay experience you shouldn't miss. It's varied and addictive; character animations are realistic and fluent; the story is excellent and audio-visually it is good looking. It deserves a place in your game collection.
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,One of the most immersive games of 2009. An epic storyline and excellent gameplay leave us almost entirely satisfied.
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"This is one sequel certainly worthy of a purchase, and no doubt a contender even for game of the year."
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"The sequel possesses hours of extra activities, a more complicated plot and still manages to maintain a great gameplay engine while adding some much appreciated tweaks to expand the controls slightly."
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"A vast improvement over the original, Assassin's Creed II is among the most compelling action sandbox titles available."
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"The sequel to one of this generation's biggest disappointments has emerged as a strong contender for game of the year, and if you didn't see that coming, don't worry - neither did we. [Christmas 2009, p.122]"
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"An ambitious, immersive experience that somehow manages to revolutionise every key flaw in its predecessor. [Issue#53, p.78]"
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"Minor annoyances aside though, Assassin's Creed II is a superb game. Ubisoft have clearly listened to the reaction to the first game and have gone out of their way to remedy its problems."
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"It's been a busy holiday season, but don't let that distract you from checking out this game ¡V you'll be surprised at how different ¡V and better ¡V the game is compared to its predecessor."
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"You can easily put over 20 hours into Assassin's Creed 2, the story is intriguing and starting to evolve and gameplay feels solid."
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,High praise for taking what felt like an idea in Assassin's Creed and turned it into one of the year¡¦s most ambitious and enjoyable games.
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"Playing Assassin's Creed II, one can't help but think Ubisoft really did listen to the criticism of the last game. Everything has been expanded upon and improved."
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,The game is truly epic and makes the first game feel like a prototype for the sequel. It is a deep and wonderfully involving game that is often breathtaking and constantly rewarding.
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"AC2 is a dramatically better game than its parent. It takes itself far less seriously, it's identified what was fun and thrown out what wasn't, and it's built upon a core free-running structure that's forever spectacular and thrilling. A little sadly, its fundamental concept and structure has been seriously overshadowed by the slicker likes of Mirror's Edge (in some ways) and Arkham Asylum (in a whole lot of ways)."
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"Ubisoft has finally realized its darling dream by creating a world where substance and style go together. Virtual tours of Florence, Venice and Tuscany are as captivating as the main story. For once in a way, ¡§open-ended¡¨ doesn¡¦t translate to ¡§boring¡¨, ¡§lifeless¡¨ or ¡§empty¡¨. The height takes your breath away every time Ezio scales a tall building; the excellent animation makes up for annoying bugs and quirky gameplay conventions. Yes, the final boss fight is borderline silly, but it¡¦s just a smudged line on a last page of a thrilling novel."
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"In short, Assassin's Creed 2 is the game that the original should have been"
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,Assassin's Creed 2 isn¡¦t perfect ¡V the controls continue to requite a bit more fine tuning but it¡¦s also impossible to deny that the sequel improves upon the original in almost every conceivable way.
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"But this isn't a reinvention, it's a refinement. Assassin's Creed II offers, fundamentally, the same kinds of thrills as its predecessor--leaping from rooftop to rooftop with surefooted ease, appearing out of nowhere to kill your target with a quick blade, then vanishing effortlessly into a crowd. It's just been expanded, streamlined, and overhauled in ways that bring it closer to grace and make it a much easier game to recommend."
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"Two years later, Assassin's Creed tries again to make real those promises from Ubisoft, and prove itself as a better game than it was. The truth is that, despite the Renaissance setting, the vivid locations and the historical landmarks, the new features added don't really improve the sequel: the same repetitive mechanics remain, as the flawed enemy AI, a rough combat system and moments of frustration coming from issues with the camera and the control response in the platform sections. Assassin's Creed II it's still a good game but far from the masterpiece Ubisoft has been promising."
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"I've got to recommend it as a purchase - if only because the fantastic free-running, beautiful Italian vistas and engrossing Animus world far outweigh any ludicrous ending or shaky start. If you didn't finish the first Assassin's Creed however, you would do well to find some background information on the story using the magic of the internet - something you really shouldn't have to do."
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"A vast improvement on the flawed original, with much more variety and a much greater sense of fun."
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"Fans of the original Assassin's Creed will find a lot to love here, but anyone who left the first game feeling unsatisfied will want to rent before they buy."
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"Assassin's Creed 2 is an excellent game. It's impressive to climb a massive cathedral from which you can overlook the entire city. The game surpasses the original game in almost every aspect, but the flawed AI and weak ending hold it back from becoming what we hoped for. It's still a beautiful adventure from the very beginning until the end."
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"Assassin's Creed II rarely gets the blood-pumping as much as some of the more visceral games of this year manage, instead opting for an air of odd serenity. Rather than bludgeoning you with a frontal assault on the senses, the beauty and elegance of the setting and gameplay washes over you, holding your attention completely."
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,Assassin's Creed II is a fun game and I recommend it.
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"To say the least, Assassin's Creed II is a disappointment ¡V not because it¡¦s bad, but because we were promised so much more. Everything Ubisoft claimed they were changing has stayed the same, and what little new touches they¡¦ve included fail to impact in the long run."
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"Although it's possible to rattle off a list of bullet-point features that imply Assassin's Creed II is head and shoulders above the first game¡Xmore missions, more story, more collectibles and extras¡XI simply didn't find them to amount to much."
2009,Assassin's Creed 2,"The game's variety and length come across as nothing more than smoke and mirrors, the endless, grinding busywork that contributes nothing to the overall gameplay is inexcusably plentiful and mind-numbingly repetitive, and to top it all off, the game can't even compete in the visuals department and somehow looks worse than the original."
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,"This action-adventure is so smart, so well-written, and delivered with such an obvious love for its source material, I daresay it is both the best licensed game ever made, and arguably the best game of its kind in our current console generation."
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,"One of those games that comes along every few years that will have gamers talking about it long into the future. It is this year's BioShock, and I for one could not put it down from start to finish. If you enjoy great narrative, interesting boss encounters, fresh gameplay and of course everyone's favorite detective then Arkham Asylum will not disappoint."
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,"It's excellent in nearly every aspect, and certainly one of the best games you'll play this year, let alone the best licensed game I've ever played (sorry Riddick). If you've been on the fence about this one, I highly suggest you pick it up, there's nothing here that'll disappoint, and like I mentioned, the gameplay is so great that you don't need to be a Batman fan to appreciate how great the gameplay is."
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,"The game also feels decidedly adult; it¡¦s unafraid to take dark turns. The writing and themes become unexpectedly morbid in later stages. It¡¦s obvious that Arkham was created with reverence, genuine craft, and love. There¡¦s a rare, considered quality behind everything on the disc, which makes this an absolute must-play."
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,"Batman: Arkham Asylum is the ultimate Batman experience, hands down."
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,"This is a full-on experience devoted to all of the different facets of being Batman, from the gadgets that help him along, to striking fear in the hearts of his opponents by carefully lurking in the shadows, to taking challenges head-on with little more than his feet and his fists, to straight-up acting like a detective, hunting around for clues. This all translates into an adventure full of variety, with each different aspect coming in at such a high level of quality that it just keeps impressing you over and over again, right up to its final moments."
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,"Batman's trip to the asylum has hardly any flaws. The controls fit perfectly and the missions will entertain you every second you play this game. Buy it, play it, love it."
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,"Rocksteady have proven that they¡¦re a company that really care. They actually ¡¥get¡¦ Batman, they¡¦ve looked at the character from every conceivable angle and strived to make this everything anybody could possibly want from a Batman game."
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,"The grim set-up mixed an incredible voice-over work and great storytelling makes of Batman: Arkham Asylum, not only the best Batman game ever published but also the best comic-book/superhero videogame so far and a very serious ¡§Game of the Year¡¨ contender."
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,"Batman: Arkham Asylum is not just the best comic game ever, the game actually managed to rank high in our best games of all time list. Whichever system you own and regardless of your gaming budget, the Dark Knight¡¦s latest adventure is not one to be missed."
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,"Arkham Asylum is a game with the power to utterly captivate you and can stand proudly alongside modern classics such as ""Resident Evil 4"",""Gears of War,"" and ""BioShock""...Simply put, Batman: Arkham Asylum is a masterpiece. [Sept 2009, p.66]"
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,"Minor gripes aside, Arkham Asylum is a remarkable achievement both in design and in finally giving Bat fans the game they've been waiting for."
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,"Batman: Arkham Asylum is this year's ""BioShock,"" not just from the connection established with the world, but from its ability to innovate where new ideas are needed, and moreover, deliver an adventure unlike any other. [Sept 2009, p.82]"
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,"A massively impressive licensed game. Without a license holding it all together Arkham Asylum would have been a stunning game with striking features. That it's all wrapped up in Batman's world makes the experience so much more appealing, and it works both as an extension of lore for Batman enthusiasts and an entry point for those less familiar with the DC universe. [Oct 2009, p.84]"
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,"Rewarding and engrossing in equal measure, the entire production reeks of quality from the stellar voice work to the jaw-dropping visuals and intuitive control system. Truly this is the Batman game that everybody¡¦s been waiting for."
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,"It combines the best features of any superhero series with fantastic graphics, solid gameplay and outstanding voice acting. The minor flaws - the easy gameplay, the initially confusing layout of Arkham and the occasional loading time hitch - are all negated a dozen times over by the game's character, atmosphere and attention to detail."
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,"Batman: Arkham Asylum is simply the best action game of 2009. Rocksteady Studios Production features an outstanding gameplay, a mature and involving storytelling and an astonishing graphic. It's a Must Buy without compromise."
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,"Fans of the franchise owe it to themselves to pick it up, and anyone with a hankering for a high-quality action game will find Arkham Asylum to be just what the doctor ordered."
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,"A phenomenal achievement, and I can¡¦t wait to see what Rocksteady has in store next¡Xpersonally, I¡¦m hoping for a sequel set in Gotham City. Arkham Asylum is the kind of game you can¡¦t stop playing, yet don¡¦t ever want to end; it was almost a shame to have to review it, because I really wanted to take my time and enjoy every inch of Arkham Island."
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,"With the beauty of this game, the amazing sound, script and voice-acting, this is definitely one game you would be ¡Vahem- batty to not buy."
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,"There is not a single-element of the Batman that this game doesn't nail, from the gadgets to the atmosphere and the combat. The action is thrilling and varied, and even the fetch quests are compelling."
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,Not only is Batman Arkham Asylum the best superhero game ever made but it could also content with some of this years big hitters for game of the year. A must buy.
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,Batman: Arkham Asylum would be a terrific third-person action game on its own thanks to the excellent combat engine and well-designed levels. But coupled with the Batman license the game becomes a must-play.
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,"The entire production reeks of quality from the stellar voice work to the jaw-dropping visuals and intuitive control system - truly this is the Batman game we've all been waiting for. It is to games what ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight"" are to movies - Batman: Arkham Asylum is without doubt the most definitive videogame realisation of the character yet. It's also unreservedly brilliant to boot."
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,"Favouring the animation series over the movie for setting was an inspired choice, and the depth of detail and maximum use of the source material make this a game that will remembered for a long time."
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,"This is certainly not a game for just Batman fans, comic fans or action fans; this is a game that everyone should play and thoroughly enjoy. It looks beautiful, plays like a dream and has a superb mix of action, stealth and detective elements. The combat is intuitive, flexible and surprisingly deep too. Give this game a go and you will not be pleasantly surprise, you will be blown away."
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,"The greatest comic book videogame of all time. This is an adult Dark Knight story that is well-told, packs some truly fun gameplay elements, has topnotch voice talent, and feel like it's part of Batman cannon."
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,"Batman: Arkham Asylum has been a real surprise, delivering us a great action game, with a deep stealth/tactical gameplay, great loyalty to the original comics and a strong plot. Undoubtedly the best comics-based video game so far, and one of the best games released this year: a real milestone."
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,"So much detail has been given to the game; graphically, sound, and even how Batman¡¦s cape flows and becomes mangled throughout the engaging story that will take roughly around 10 hours or so to complete the first time."
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,"Without a doubt, Arkham Asylum is one of the best games of the year, and from the solid single player experience, amazing voice acting, rewarding challenge maps and a slew of nearly dozens of unlockable bios and collectibles, any fan will be hard-pressed to not give this game a try."

2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,"Rocksteady Studios damn-nearly astonished us with this one. We expected it to be a decent summer action game. In all fairness, we never expected it to be this much fun. Batman: Arkham Asylum outshines every game we've seen this year (so far)."

2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,The longevity of Batman: AA is tremendously astounding as a single-player only title.

2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,"The gameplay is diversified, the graphics are great and the combat-system is one of the best we have ever encountered. Batman: Arkham Asylum is a definite ""Must-Have"" on any platform and more then worthy to wear the famous name of The Dark Knight and Worlds greatest detective."
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,"Batman Arkham Asylum is a product of absolute value that can count on a cast of colorful characters to build a great game, really fun. The greatest strengths of the production lie in the gameplay built around what are the real capabilities of Batman, mixing action and stealth section, but always related with the universe from which have been extrapolated. Rocksteady's game is certainly the new standard for understanding how produce games under license, adapting for videogaming the very spirit of this historic character."
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,"Impeccable presentation from top to bottom. [Nov 2009, p.82]"
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,"It would be too easy, if not unfair, to consider this game as just the tie in you don't expect. Batman AA is one of the best action adventure you can play in this generation of hardware, mixing in an almost impeccable way the best elements taken from this genre's masterpieces."
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,"A really good game with amazing graphics and a deep story! Not only for fans of the ""Batman"" universe."
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,"Arkham Asylum is the kind of eventual coming-to-form which renders years of half-arsed franchise transplantation not just forgivable, but worthwhile."
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,"Fans of the caped crusader really shouldn't hesitate - this isn't just the best grown-up Batman game, it's the best superhero game, bar none."
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,"Not only a brilliantly authentic presentation of its subject matter but a tremendous game in its own right, Batman: Arkham Asylum is a big, clever and finely crafted experience which propels Rocksteady immediately into the realm of triple-A developers. This year's BioShock. That's what it is."
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,"A brilliant experience. No other license-shackled developer has understood their subject quite as well as Rocksteady, and this is without a doubt the definitive representation of the Dark Knight."
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,"As well as being wonderfully constructed, the environment drips with atmosphere."
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,The result is so good that we're declaring it an easy 'Best of' contender for 2009.
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,"Regardless of whether you're getting sucked into the Story mode or competing for high scores in the Challenge mode, Batman: Arkham Asylum does an outstanding job of letting you be Batman. Everything about this game--the impressive visuals, stirring soundtrack, superb voice acting, fiendish puzzles, hard-hitting combat--feels like it has been lovingly crafted by a development team that's both knowledgeable and passionate about the source material."
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,"Arkham Asylum is not just the greatest game ever made about the Dark Knight, it might be the best superhero game yet."
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,"Batman: Arkham Asylum is a top quality game, the best one to celebrate the Dark Knight in a long time. You'll love it even if you don't like the character. If Batman is the reason you live, you can't ask for anything better."
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,"With a series of combat and stealth challenge rooms with online leader boards rounding off the package, Arkham Asylum is a brilliantly polished and wholly engrossing prospect. Few licensed titles have captured so authentically and completely the ethos of its inspiration as Arkham Asylum."
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,There isn¡¦t a single element of Arkham Asylum that isn¡¦t polished to the utmost degree.
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,My absolute favorite aspect of Arkham Asylum has to be its boss fights.
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,"Whether you fancy skulking in the shadows, smashing slow motion fists in into a goon's skull, or simply using some cool gadgets, you can do no wrong with what is Eidos' best game in years."
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,"Batman Arkham Asylum is by far the biggest surprise this year. This is not only a great game based on a license, this is one of the top titles this year. Rocksteady has put everything that's cool with Batman and his villains in this game, and it all works astonishingly. However, this epic tale is surprisingly over before you know it, not only because it's a short game, but also because you're having so much fun while playing it."
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,"This is the must-have Batman game of all-time and a great third-person action game. Whether you're a fan or just looking for a solid game, you should pick this up. You will not be dissappointed."
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,"This should serve as a reminder that a strong license shouldn¡¦t be a millstone around a game designer¡¦s neck but a gold mine, a vast stockpile of prebuilt characters and relationships that, properly tweaked, can work just as well in a videogame as they do in a movie or comic book series."
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,"Simply put, you have to play Batman: Arkham Asylum to be reminded why you love games in the first place."
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,"This is not only one of the best superhero games ever, but one the best action games I¡¦ve played in a long time. A definite contender for game of the year with the Dark Knight detective at his best."
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,"While it¡¦s slightly hurt by a few minor problems, Batman: Arkham Asylum rises above them to provide an unforgettable experience. Part of it is due to the well-crafted storyline, but it¡¦s also due to the well-made gameplay that makes most things easy to do and certainly more than any Batman game released in the last 15 years."
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,"Batman: Arkham Asylum isn't just for the fans: it delivers a great experience to all lovers of action games. The game effortlessly combines puzzle-, stealth- and fighting-elements. Arkham Asykum sets the new standard for future licensed games."

2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,Normally you just want to avoid an asylum. But Batman's Arkham Asylum is one you just want to explore. Never before was it so much fun to fight with a bat!
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,"Aside from those small niggles, Batman Arkham Asylum is not only a stellar example of how superhero games can work but also with narrative as a whole."
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,"Rocksteady really have delivered here in the authenticity stakes. The game is entirely self-referential, with lots of fan-baiting namedrops and a slew of villain profiles and inmate recordings to be found, you will be on fanboy cloud nine here."
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,"Batman: Arkham Asylum is a massive triumph: Action, stealth and investigation as its best. The best videogame based on Bob Kane¡¦s composition, and the best superhero game this far too. A brilliant work that drives Rocksteady to the highest rank of developers."
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,What may be one of Batman¡¦s worst nights of his life may end up being one of many players¡¦ best experiences of the year.
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,"Batman proves himself in this fantastic game. It is more then a good license game, it is a must have!"
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,"A rare breed of game. Not only is it a licensed title that really makes the most of the license, with gameplay mechanics that cater to Batman¡¦s character, a compelling setting and story, and a host of well-known characters, it¡¦s also a very polished product. You can tell that a whole lot of love has gone into this one."
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,The stealth portions are somewhat simple in execution but satisfying when you get it right. When you are high above the enemy scoping them out in order to plan your attacks you really do feel like Batman.
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,A worthy and worthwhile purchase if there ever was one during the closing moments of the Summer.
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,"A well-made and mostly fun interpretation of hte Batman universe, Arkham Asylum lacks evolution and can wear thin, but it stands up admirably in a very competitive genre. [Issue#50, p.84]"
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,"Batman: Arkham Asylum doesn't quite deliver on all of its big ideas, and thus dodges the highest of accolades, but its rousing peaks make its low points more than bearable. Its best moments of dazzling showmanship easily qualify as must-see entertainment, even if they're not sufficient to make the game as a whole a must-play."
2009,Batman: Arkham Asylum,It triumphs where most other superhero games and other types of licensed action games fail: it makes you feel like the lead character. It makes you feel like The Batman.
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"Modern Warfare 2 crosses into the must-have category of video games effortlessly. It offers an unmatched shooter experience, a compelling story mode, a slick package of mini missions and a multiplayer which is pretty much unparalleled in depth."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"Modern Warfare 2 offers epic gameplay, a stunning Spec-Ops mode and a huge amount of adrenaline."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"Anyone who already has issues with the single-player ¡¥style¡¦ of IW¡¦s games will still find fault with the scripted, linear experience, but in terms of sheer drama and show-stopping set-pieces accompanied by laser sharp FPS controls, Modern Warfare 2 is your daddy. And that¡¦s without Spec Ops and Multiplayer."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,You're always unlocking something and messing around with your created classes to find just the right balance of tactics and murderousness. That balance is the true core of Modern Warfare 2's online play. It's an exhilarating mix that forces tension by rewarding you for taking it slowly.
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"As much as I liked the single-player, even I have to admit that the multiplayer is where the real action is, and its new additions should (hopefully) help counterbalance some (but probably not all) of the dissension that will arise from the n00b friendly changes I noted."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"This is a textbook example to other developers of the love, care, attention, polish and guile needed when crafting a sequel. An essential purchase for all FPS fans. [Ryan King]"
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"Mixing real-world locations with bombastic set-pieces MW2 continues the guided, thrill-ride experiences of its predecessor, and adds even more depth to its multiplayer offerings. It might not have fixed all the problems from the first game, but there's just so much quality content packed into this game that it will almost certainly be one of the most-played games in your library for a long time to come."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"The fact that I didn't even get into the stunning visuals and amazing sound design speaks volumes about the sheer amount of content in the game, and I could probably write another 800 words simply about the ridiculous attention to detail on display in each level."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"The singleplayer knows no competition and the multiplayer and brilliant Special Ops-mode make Modern Warfare 2 a phenomenal package. There are truly some scenes in the game that can affect the way you think and feel. After five games, the series seems to have found its high mark. One of the best shooters ever."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"Buy it, play it and enjoy it. Few games offer this much: a great (albeit short) campaign, incredible multiplayer modes and the Special Ops mode, which could be sold as a standalone game."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"It's hard to see the majority of people wanting to play any other multiplayer shooter until the next CoD is released, such is the quality of what's on offer here...Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 takes everything that was great about CoD4 and ramps it up to the next level. With the best multiplayer shooting that money can buy, an incredibly action-packed campaign and plenty of superb two-player co-op levels, this is without a doubt a real contender for game of the year."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,Modern Warfare 2 has stepped up its game and it has been well worth the wait.
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"What impresses me so much about this game is not only that it has a tremendous amount of hype surrounding it which it does, but that it delivers even through all of that."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is the defining first person shooter of the current generation and it¡¦s hard to imagine that anyone will better it anytime soon.
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"Infinity Ward delivers the ""greatest hits"" of action movies with references to Cliffhanger, Red Dawn, The Rock, and even Spies Like Us. You¡¦re fighting in the arctic one minute and crossing the desert the next, or you might be performing a rescue operation on a terrorist-controlled offshore oil platform or infiltrating a Russian submarine base."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"Modern Warfare 2 is a masterpiece of careful iteration, with an unmatched presentation and a well of content that will take months to run dry."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"With a great six to eight hour single-player campaign, the fun Special Ops mode meant to be enjoyed with a friend, and its endlessly replayable multiplayer experience, MW2 has a ton of content and reasons to keep coming back to it."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,Graphically Modern Warfare 2 sets a bar so high that the game that our industry will look to it as a blueprint of what can be done on next-gen systems. The developers found a perfect balance between realistic and entertainment (just wait until you play-through the airport level) that there were points during our review period that we actually forgot we weren¡¦t watching a HD movie.
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"I was impressed by its presentation, visuals and the wealth of gameplay it offers. I even enjoyed its story¡Xthough it¡¦s admittedly fluffy, convoluted and campy in spots, it¡¦s like a interactive war movie on TV that takes liberties with realism for the sake of being entertaining to watch (such as having an amazingly large number of helicopters crash to the ground over the course of the game)."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"Modern Warfare 2 is sensational, and sets a very high bar in the Call of Duty series. Well done guys!"
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"It was expected to be one of this year greatest gamers, and yes, it is."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"Modern Warfare 2 was super-hyped, but Infinity Ward didn't disappoint: this is undoubtedly the most spectacular FPS around, made with extraordinary care and attention to details. If you're looking for an astonishing single player experience or a deep and enduring multiplayer, this is the game to buy."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,Infinity Ward hits another one out of the park with Modern Warfare 2.
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"Modern Warfare 2 shatters the old standard of excellence and has raised the bar for what it means to be an epic shooter. With a mind-shattering campaign, superb co-op play, and the deepest multiplayer experience on Live, Modern Warfare 2 is one of the greatest shooters in gaming history, and a must-own for fans of the genre."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"Multiplayer is fast, frantic and as exciting as ever."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"Everything a great sequel should be, and fans of the series will love the additions Infinity Ward have included this time around. Easily one of the best games this year, and a contender for the best shooter currently available for next-gen consoles."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"When it comes to games which offer single and multiplayer, you'd have to be a harsh judge to claim a better first person shooter on console has been released this year, if ever. Modern Warfare 2 is closer to fulfilling the promises made by Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 than any game out there beyond Uncharted 2."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"The air of unpredictability and the care that was paid to each separate element puts it in lofty company. The multiplayer hasn't received an overhaul, but considering most shooters are still playing catch-up with Call of Duty 4, the tweaks and twists make it the best multiplayer shooting experience in the industry. Few games manage to meet such high expectations."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"The War on Terror never rests. The same goes for Infinity Ward, who raises the bar again with Modern Warfare 2. Its new campaign keeps delivering a cinematic, inmersive, and visually spectacular experience, while polishing AI and respawn issues, and offering a minimum of 8 hours of gameplay. Without a multiplayer rival, where it's as powerful as a Tactical Nuke, including a first approach to coop, and archiving excellence in every aspect, this last Call of Duty proves itself as a very solid candidate to become the game of the year."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"The surprise factor of the first Modern Warfare is missing, although it doesn¡¦t affect this awesome sequel which is even better than the former. This new Call of Duty iteration exceeds every expectation and earns a place among the best shooters of this year."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"For those planning to check out everything Modern Warefare 2 has to offer ¡V online competition, full co-op Spec Ops mode, as well as the campaign ¡V you¡¦re looking at a no-brainer purchase. For the strictly single player crowd, however, Modern Warfare 2 is surprisingly short, and doesn¡¦t live up to the standard set by previous Call of Duty games."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"The story is compelling, the multiplayer is addictive, and Special Ops mode comes out of the gate swinging, prepared to shock gamers with a feature most likely didn¡¦t know existed. The package, on the whole, is spectacular, there¡¦s no two ways about it."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"Perhaps the greatest feat that Infinity Ward has performed is not only living up to the hype of Modern Warfare 2, but actually exceeding it."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"But value and longevity be damned, it¡¦s the emotional impact Modern Warfare 2 brings to the table that in the end deserves the highest of praise."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,The cinematic appeal of the singleplayer action makes it infectious and hugely memorable in a way few if any other games can manage. That this is bundled with the best multiplayer experience of any game really leaves us in little doubt that this is the complete package.
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,Modern Warfare 2 raises the bar for online gaming making this a must have for this area alone.
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,The game constantly adds something new to the mix without straying too far from the traditional first-person shooter formula and is sure to be worth the wait for fans everywhere.
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"Modern Warfare 2's emotional and intense single-player game is a thrilling rollercoaster ride of exciting moments, while the multiplayer is truly a definitive experience for online FPS players everywhere. This game lives up to the hype."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a must have game and one that should stay in your collection...period.
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"If the campaign's story was shaped better and made more sensible, and if the online Perks were just a tiny bit more balanced, this would be a near-perfect game, no shadow of a doubt. As it stands, however, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is an utterly stellar achievement that knows exactly what its audience wants, and delivers in abundance. Truly, this is the biggest game of 2009."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"There was a lot of hype leading up to the release of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, and for the most part the sequel lives up to it¡¦s billing."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"The campaign, while short, is epic and a lot more intense then the original Modern Warfare. The enemy A.I. is a lot smarter and will make you rethink your tactics from time to time."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,Deliver[s] an intense and satisfying gaming experience.
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"With the music of Hans Zimmer and the cinematic scenes, you're sucked into the game and spit out after you¡¦re done. The single player is rather short. It will take you about six hours to beat the game, but you get an intense and memorable ride the entire time. The game seems to be a little scripted, but it isn¡¦t annoying for everyone. The multiplayer isn¡¦t annoying at all. You can play for hundreds of hours without being bored. The Spec Ops mode extends that with fun for two. If you ever played a shooter and liked it, buy this game!"
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is simply a terrific game and a solid addition to the Call of Duty franchise.
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"The addition of the masterful Spec-Ops modes goes a long way to making up for the uneven campaign though, and the competitive multiplayer is as addictive as expected."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"Modern Warfare 2 is easily one of the year¡¦s best games. Because it¡¦s more iterative than innovative, though, it¡¦s not quite as perfect as we¡¦d expected, but it is a terrifically fun, nerve-wrackingly intense spectacle that you¡¦d be crazy to miss."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"The best Call of Duty yet - and possibly, the best shooter, too. Get enlisted. [Winter 2009, p.62]"
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"Loud, epic and incredibly polished, MW2 is this year's biggest must-have shooter."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"Absolutely one of the most rounded gaming packages of 2009. The single player campaign ¡V while not long ¡V is well-paced, with plenty of variety in settings and gameplay, and will definitely be a steep challenge on the harder difficulty levels. The multiplayer component is fully featured, with an expansive set of modes and maps, and it¡¦s great to see persistent stats returning. Rounding it out is Spec Ops, which is very much the icing on the cake."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"This game has so many standout moments of such immersive power, there really is no other experience out there to touch Modern Warfare 2¡¦s controlled and entertaining pandemonium. Infinty Ward has skill, panache and big, hanging balls that clang as loud as Big Ben, so much so a the bar has been raised with Modern Warfare 2."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"The previous installment was great, but this installment of Call of Duty puts the previous to respectful shame. Packed with the best visuals you've seen on the 360 and fantastic gameplay, you'll have a resonating experience like no other."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"If the first Modern Warfare wasn¡¦t your cup of tea, then it¡¦s unlikely the numerous additions and small tweaks will do anything for you here. Yet for anyone else who¡¦s a fan of console first person shooters with plenty of replay value, this is a game that¡¦s definitely worth signing up for."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"While I generally don¡¦t often gravitate towards ultra-realistic military shooters, Modern Warfare 2 is easily one of my top games of the year."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a masterpiece in terms of FPS gameplay and graphics. The different locations and the variety of situation you¡¦ll encounter are often jaw-dropping. But it is also a controversial game for some extreme situations the player might encounter along the road.
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,Compelling and intense.
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"This is a leader in the genre and a must own for anyone who enjoys online combat, and although a longer solo campaign would always be welcome, you can¡¦t accuse what does exist of being underwhelming."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"Doesn't change the record but pumps up the volume. The last essential FPS of the decade. [Jan 2010, p.64]"
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"MW2 is spectacular in all the right areas; building and refining on the most solid of bases. And although its political heart might not be in the ¡¥right¡¦ place, at the very least it might make a few people think rather than skim through on muscle memory and twitch reactions. That¡¦s a rarity in itself, and something to be respected in an age of apathy."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"Modern Warfare 2 carries the good tradition of its predecessor. The campaign is nonetheless too short, and it feels too inspired to the previous one; on the other side, the multiplayer carries a lot of improvements, and Spec Ops is a well crafted coop mode. If you consider buying for online fun, this is the game that will steal your life for the months to come. If you're up to an unforgettable single player experience you might consider other more lengthy and original titles."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"While at times the action can make you whiz by the environments, slowing down will allow you to take in the beauty of the environments. There isn¡¦t quite the real-life detail as seen in the last game with Chernobyl, but Modern Warfare 2 has its own great detailing. And best of all, you won¡¦t have any hiccups or lag."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"Given the care and attention lavished upon the competitive and cooperative multiplayer in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, it's clear that Infinity Ward sees the future of the Modern Warfare series in that particular component. What that means is you'll end up with a game that doesn't show much in the single-player experience, but once you take it online, it's going to be difficult to put down."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"It looks better, it plays better, the story is more intense and the multiplayer is more inviting. And with the inclusion of SpecOps, the longevity of this game is sure to have increased as well."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"At first, it may seem as MW2 is not able to surpass or even match its predecessor, but thanks to a mindblowing second half of the singleplayer-part and a solid multiplayer, it¡¦s nevertheless an amazing experience and a definite ""must-have"" for every shooter fan."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"Multiplayer is what it's all about, and here it's is head and shoulders (and torso and waist and legs and feet) above its nearest competition in terms of accessibility, balancing, strategic depth, technical prowess, and all around fun - so much so that it makes the campaign mode look like an tiny, ugly mole hidden away in some bodily crevice."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"It's well worth picking up, and even if you missed out on the original, there's no reason you couldn't pick this one up and enjoy it just as much as the rest of the fans, making it one of the more accessible ""hardcore"" FPS experiences out there."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,Modern Warfare has no need to fear the comparison with a Hollywood blockbuster. You wouldn't find a game that keeps so in touch and never let¡¦s you go. You just have to go on like you were pulled by a rope.
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"With another memorable single player mode to look back on, in addition to the excellent Special Ops mode and more multiplayer goodness to look forward to, Infinity Ward has once again come up with a cinematic masterpiece."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"Modern Warfare 2 balances the spectacle and silliness of its single-player campaign with a deep, enduring multiplayer core, carefully covering its bases for players of all persuasions. But there is no denying it seeks merely to build upon the successes of its forebear while doing very little to expand its scope or redefine them."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 has more than enough guns, modes and ""oh-my-god"" moments to propel it to the very top of your must have list, with astounding visuals, crystal-clear (and at times, frightening) audio and enough plot twists to make you second guess everything, so gear up, hop onto your snowmobile and haul ass to the nearest store."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is must buy game. Infinity Ward, despite innovating the game, had listened to the players, taking the best features of the prequel and adding something new."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"A dazzling package. A singleplayer campaign crammed with set-pieces that pull the player through at breakneck speed sits alongside Spec Ops, 23 co-op missions and a MW greatest hits package, before that superlative multiplayer, which really needs no introduction. With such attractions on offer, this is a shooter that demands playing, and playing again. It is still Call Of Duty, but its execution is skilful, mostly thoughtful, and it boasts the highest of production values."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"Modern Warfare 2 is the perfect example of a great sequel for a great game. This awesome first person shooter has a short but exciting story and one of the best multiplayer in the console market. The new mode, called Special Ops., is perfect to co-op with a friend for short and fantastic game sessions."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"It's not the originality of the design, but the workmanship, that makes this one of the best FPS ever."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"Modern Warfare 2 ticks all of the right boxes: varied gameplay, immersive story, engaging gunplay, superb multiplayer, and the list goes on... If we're being really nitpicky, then we might suggest that there aren't many innovative features in the game. However, MW2's Spec Ops mode is fresh enough to ensure that the overall package isn't a stale one, while the long-term appeal of adversarial multiplayer will stretch out until the next Infinity Ward release with ease."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"Modern Warfare 2 nails the three pillars of play--campaign, cooperative, and multiplayer--to earn its place in the pantheon of modern shooters."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"Modern Warfare 2 does indeed live up to the hype. If you've ever wanted to be in an action movie, this is probably the closest you will get."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,The moments when Modern Warfare 2 isn¡¦t good are few and far between. That¡¦s about all you can ask from a hero.
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"Though MW2 suffers from some of the same faults as its other ¡¥modern¡¦ predecessor, its still a well made package that shows how although no game is perfect, a developer can still put out great work. If you like shooters at all, Modern Warfare 2 is the piece of work this year that you should be playing ¡V like, right now."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"Fans of the Call of Duty franchise won¡¦t want to skip Modern Warfare 2 as it¡¦s the most in-depth, involving Call of Duty release to date. Modern Warfare 2 is really three different gaming experiences rolled up into one package, and when you add up the value of each component, Modern Warfare 2 feels like a steal."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"The single player, albeit disappointing, is still an excellent thrill ride and precursor to the main pull: the multiplayer. CoD4 cemented its place as one of the best online shooters going and Modern Warfare 2 builds on it, adding a plethora of new features that constantly reward and amaze."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,They improve the ultimate multiplayer game by adding a lot of options to tune your online experience. The campaign is short and intensive and the Spec Ops mode is a lot of fun for you and a friend.
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"As you would expect from a Call of Duty title, Modern Warfare 2 offers an intense and exhilarating single player experience with the only disappointment that it doesn¡¦t last very long."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,Modern Warfare 2 is an intense ride from start to finish with varied environments and fast paced action in true Infinity Ward fashion. Though the single-player campaign may be only a few hours long the improved multiplayer and Special-Ops co-op missions will keep you busy for months.
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"Modern Warfare 2 is 'just' a videogame, and a damn good one at that, in terms of sheer, heart-thumping spectacle it'll deliver in spades; just don't expect the Second Coming. [Christmas 2009, p.98]"
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"A must-have game for more than than the multiplayer. [Issue#53, p.82]"
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,Infinity Ward has made the wise choice of not padding the game out to satisfy angry internet comment posters but has instead provided a completely satisfying experience that sits beside the vast multiplayer components perfectly.
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a great game, but not as great as we expected. The revamped multiplayer and new spec ops are worth the price, but the single player is too much similar to the first episode and it lacks the excellence of the story telling of Modern Warfare."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"Did you think you had seen it all in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare? Get ready then for this war! Don't think Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 will be a revolution, it's more like an evolution if you compare this to the first Modern Warfare game."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is solid continuation of the original Modern Warfare.
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"Modern Warfare 2 is undoubtedly the single biggest release this year; not only in gaming but in entertainment, period. It delivers in a lot of areas; it has a campaign marinated in grandeur (even if it is to short) and a deep, engaging multiplayer facet (even if it is littered with connectivity issues)."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"A true video-game equivalent of a Jerry Bruckheimer/Michael Bay action movie. The singleplayer is engaging while it lasts, but the game's true value lies in the multiplayer. The online matches are fast, fun and highly addictive. [Nov 2010]"
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"Though not quite living up to its predecessor, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is undoubtedly one of the best games of the holiday season. With an epic single-player, challenging and entertaining Spec Ops mode and greatly improved multiplayer, Modern Warfare 2 is a call that should not go unanswered."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"If you imagine a game where you have the starring role in a ""realistic"" Roger Moore/Timothy Dalton-era James Bond flick, with more emphasis on shooting things that move and less on scoring with sultry women, then you have a pretty solid idea of what Modern Warfare 2 is all about."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,Call of Duty: Modern Warfare was a powerful entry into the first-person genre and an example of how linear gameplay could be exciting.
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"In spite of its good looks, Modern Warfare 2 has the slightest whiff of insecurity. It feels like the developers, under pressure to top the original Modern Warfare, engaged in a bit of hand-wringing this time around."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"Overall, I found Modern Warfare 2 to be fun but it's starting to lose the appeal it had for me after the fourth time around with Infinity Ward. The campaign is really short and the story's pretty weak. Also, there will be parts that offend people but at least you can skip the ""one"" mission. Multiplayer can be fun and addicting if you don't get frustrated easily."
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,There are two issues that make the campaign less than perfect. First is the length. Given the price gouging Activision has embarked on with this release the centrepiece of the game is insultingly short. Played on normal you have one evening's play here for your 50 or so pounds...Secondly the pace of the game is very one note.
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"The holiday season is noticeably bare, and Modern Warfare 2 stands tall, with its brilliant, value-packed missions, maps, and promised endless nights of thousand-yard stares and slack-jawed home entertainment"
2009,Call of Duty: MW2,"The single player stages are much too linear, the co-op missions are reused from the single player campaign, and the main multiplayer deathmatch style modes are very unbalanced, especially for new players. But like Uncharted 2, MW2 is like an insane action packed movie that you can participate inÿ too bad the game¡¦s heavy use of scripted events make the player feel like they have do not have any control regarding the out come of the final experience."
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"L4D2 delivers multiple improvements over its predecessor, and I get to keep all my fingers and toes."
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"Left 4 Dead 2 is the Empire Strikes Back of zombie games. The momentum has clearly swung in favor of the bad guys. But also much like Empire, this is clearly the best of the bunch and is a required purchase for fans of the genre."
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"Left 4 Dead 2 took a great first-person shooter experience and added fresh new gameplay modes, loads of murdering and surviving accessories from melee weapons to adrenaline shots, all of which continues to satiate my desires for an FPS game that I can happily and easily spend a copious amount of hours on."
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"Left 4 Dead 2 improves on most everything from the first one, while adding enough new levels, Infected types, weapons, and items to give a new experience."
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"An undisputable improvement over its predecessor in every way, and it steals its own crown as best co-op game on the Xbox. It's chainsaw-twirlingly good. [Holiday 2009, p.64]"
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"The newest chapter in the undead uprising now oozes with even more of the proven developer¡¦s trademark personality and polish. If you are among those who think the sequel is coming too soon, prepare to eat your words like so many brains. Left 4 Dead 2 is everything a sequel should be: perfected, expanded, and an absolute riot."
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"Whichever you prefer, playing versus with friends or cooperatively against the improved Director, there is almost no fault to Left 4 Dead 2."
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"The original premise has proven more versatile than I ever would have imagined, and the new modes, new Infected, new Campaigns and new items make it feel like a completely different experience. What's more, the Southern setting has made the game even scarier, with the redneck look of the Infected creating a more unnerving bestiary of creatures to contend with. Ultimately, this game is bigger, better and more crazy than the last, and if you loved the first game, you really do need to pick it up."
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"This well-crafted sequel takes everything from the original game, adds in some new features and additional variety, and refines the whole package into the new must-play cooperative title."
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"A triumph over the first in every way, Left 4 Dead 2 is not to be missed (or boycotted) if you loved the first one."
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"A masterclass in co-op, level design, first-person shooting mechanics, and even scripting. [Christmas 2009, p.62]"
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"Left 4 Dead 2 is a near perfect slice of gaming heaven, set in gaming hell."
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"If you¡¦re a fan of the original, there¡¦s absolutely no reason not to get L4D2. It¡¦s got more of everything that made the first game such a blast to play, and actually manages to make the experience remarkably better."
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"By no means is L4D2 a reinvention of the series, but with so many welcome additions, it feels close to being the perfection of it."
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"Those of you who had doubts about this being just another glorified expansion need to stop yelling at Valve and give Left 4 Dead 2 a try, as it is incomparably better than the first game by a large margin."
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"With five campaigns, more enemies, better weapons, and plenty of challenges, you will probably still be playing this game well into 2010. There are a few issues, but these are easy to overlook when the gameplay is so fun and satisfying. Once again, Valve has made the zombie apocalypse one of the best experiences of the year."
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"L4D2 may be more of the same, but in a thoroughly pleasing sense."
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"In spite of its few faults, Left 4 Dead 2 is a very worthwhile sequel, and any fears you may have about this game merely being an overpriced expansion will melt away as soon as you start playing."
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,It is by far one of the most satisfying cooperative experiences out there at the moment and completely overshadows its predecessor.
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,The first one innovated; this one polishes.
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"With more modes, weapons, health items, special infected - you name it! - L4D2 feels like a massive upgrade from the original L4D."
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"A masterpiece of co-op gaming that's endlessly replayable and genuinely scary. [Jan 2010, p.76]"
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,This is my favorite multiplayer game of all time. If I had another child I would name it Ellis whether it was a boy or girl.
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"it remains one of the most distinctive co-operative titles out there, and allows for some of the most nerve-searing team-based multiplayer gaming on the market."
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"Incredible cooperative and competitive multiplayer is brilliantly designed around the new maps, modes and enemies."
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"When it was first announced, I thought Left 4 Dead 2 was nothing more than a glorified expansion. After having spent hours with it -- and many more to come -- I appreciate the sequel's major and subtle differences."
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"More maps, more enemies, more weapons, more glorious spectacle than the original, and that¡¦s just the co-op. Fresh versus modes and intense violence make this the apocalypse to beat."
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"Whereas once we treated Left 4 Dead as a stopgap between Half-Lifes, this is no longer a weird little side project with modest expectations, and Valve is confident enough to play around with it, safe in the knowledge that you can trust your players. Left 4 Dead proved it. And whereas that game had a personality, this one is overflowing with it."
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"If L4D2 is sometimes over-complicated by its glut of small innovations, then it also substantially rewards the player with its few large ideas: confusion gives way to depth and dynamism, grander thrills and starker dramas. We¡¦re still interested in the fate of the original game¡¦s heroes, but this sequel affirms that the way ahead is due south."
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"And that's L4D2 all over: in every game, the world ends a slightly different way. You'll find a different route to take, you'll hear another dud story from Ellis, you'll try a different weapon combination, or a different tactic in the finale."
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"The co-op works better than ever, the atmosphere is dense and the scale is more massive than expected."
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"Although the game's a brain splattering good time, we still don't understand why Valve refuses to allow users to aim down the sights of a weapon, instead of always shooting from the hip. It gets the job done most of the time, but we feel everyone's accuracy would improve if they could line up their shots."
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"With exciting new content across the board and plenty of it, Left 4 Dead 2 outdoes its predecessor and makes the zombie apocalypse an absolute blast."
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,With so many improvements over the original this is well worth a trip to the shops. Be warned it is a lot harder than before.
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"Unpredictable, funny and extremely enjoyable with friends, Left 4 Dead 2 overtake pretty well the previous title. Easily one of the best multiplayer games out there at the moment."
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,A top-quality shooter with oodles of style.
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"Left 4 Dead 2 takes the best from the first game and improves it. Despite the few technical advances, Valve has make the most of its time these months and has improved, when possible, every aspect of the original game."
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"The bottom line is fun - with a friend or 3 in tow, L4D2 is an absolute blast."
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"In the Left 4 Dead series, the perennially over-performing Valve has put together yet another classic franchise, and while the absence of fundamental overhaul obliges me to be sparing in my praise of the sequel, it should serve you long after Modern Warfare 2¡¦s charms have faded."
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"Tired of zombies in games? Left 4 Dead 2 makes the done-to-death genre come to life once more! Compared to the original, this sequel is better in every way. The weapons, settings, multiplayer: everything in Left 4 Dead 2 is near-perfect. There¡¦s still no room for single players though, the game is all about working together. But that¡¦s exactly what makes the game so incredible."
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,Valve has created a more robust version of its predecessor by offering a ton of new content while not losing sight of everything that made Left 4 Dead a sure-fire hit last year. The zombie apocalypse has never looked more appealing.
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"Overall this is another incredibly polished game by Valve. I know there were a lot of people worried because of how quickly this sequel came out, however, Valve seems to have hit a home run with this one."
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"The co-operative and multiplayer experience of Left 4 Dead 2 is much like that of the original, but with some intriguing new modes of play."
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"In short, this is a frantic thrill-ride, as fast paced as anything you are likely to endure. Even for those that were not fans of the original, I¡¦d suggest giving this a try. For those that loved the first, this game is a must-have, polished and refined in every way, infinitely re-playable and guaranteed to keep you on the edge of your seat."
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"Left 4 Dead 2 manages to recapture the strong points of the first game while improving on them too. If the real zombie apocalypse is going to be as fun as this one, you have nothing to worry about."
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"Zombie perfection. [Issue#53, p.86]"
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"Despite the new changes and how much they add to and improve the overall gameplay, it still feels like the same fun zombie killing game at its core."
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,This Left 4 Dead 2 is pure cooperative joy.
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"This is Valve trying to better L4D1 in every way, succeeding but never really breaking away from what did work first time, taking creative risks and really pushing the series forward. In any case play it, love it, it¡¦s one of the best multiplayer games I¡¦ve ever played."
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"Left 4 Dead 2 is an insanely fun co-op and competitive online experience, and that¡¦s a great similarity to have with the original."
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"If you are a fan of the original (and who¡¦s not?) then you will find much enjoyment in the sequel, and whilst many of the game's previous concerns still haven¡¦t been squashed you can only hope that Valve fixes and adds to the game over the coming month... and hope not to see that announcement for Left 4 Dead 3 in November 2010."
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"Left 4 Dead 2 misses the sense of wonder of the first chapter but still has a lot of new content, a more compelling competitive experience and some great campaigns. It's a full game, not a data disk, and It worth all the money It costs."
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,L4D2 is fun. If you are like me and you love zombie films then this game will entertain you for weeks.
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"Left 4 Dead 2 is strongly suggested to everyone who prefers to play cooperatively with friends, sharing an adventure of horror and fear rather than fighting in the usual multiplayer FPS's: to complete the five different campaigns you'll have to act tactically and in strict collaboration with the other players."
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"Though not an astounding improvement over the original, Left 4 Dead 2 successfully rekindles that magical zombie-hunting feeling with great new content, and a cool competitive multiplayer mode to boot. It may take some convincing to draw you to its cause, but cooperative team-based shooting is rarely more fun, or hectic, than this."
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"More modes, more scary zombie madness, a totally different feel to how you romp through the campaign and so much more. Yes, it¡¦s all very familiar, but you won¡¦t regret paying the cash for what is the best co-operative multiplayer experience around."
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"This is a finely tuned re-installment of the game and one that includes the trademark visuals, sound, game play and tradition that Valve has steeped within it's most favored franchises."
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"Despite some technical issues, L4D2 is a great sequel. Same gameplay formula with a new setting and many entertaining game modes."
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"Left 4 Dead 2 its the best multi co-op game for Xbox 360. More weapons, more enemies, more blood. And better gameplay than the original in this great sequel."
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"Five new campaigns, two multiplayer modes and many new features are big deal for everyone who loved the first Left 4 Dead. It's still the best cooperative experience you can find out there, so be a good boy and get yourself into some good ol' zombie creaming. On the other hand, whoever didn't get involved with the first one won't have any reason to get this sequel."
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"It's easy to see that Valve took the concept of Left 4 Dead to a higher level. Everything looks better and there are more enemies. The sound in the game is just as good as the first part, and the graphics are even better. Still, there are some things which could have been better, but despite that it's a great game to have in your collection."
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"I am going to have to point out that the guts of the action is really quite basic: see zombie, kill zombie. But this game was always meant to be more of the ""see zombie, make pithy remark to friend via Xbox live, kill zombie"" type."
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"While Left 4 Dead 2 is a fantastic game that delivers an incredible experience, many of the new features just feel like additional content that could have made the original even better."
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,Left 4 Dead 2 contains everything that made the first game great and so much more.
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"This is a polished, more feature-filled version of the original game that adds enough new to make it worthy of purchase by fans of the series. Melee weapons, new modes and new zombie types make this a must have for those that adored the original game."
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"Sure, L4D2 features new weapons, new game modes and new infected, but in the end, these are all pretty minor additions. What makes L4D2 a great game is what made the original so popular: exhilarating co-operative action with three buddiesÿ and zombies."
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,It is true; L4D2 plays out very similarly to the original smash hit. But the fast paced four player co-op is quite entertaining and the new material is enough to experience this sequel even if you have played the hell out of the first game.
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"If you're one of the people who it does appeal to, get ready for a great ride and months of online play. These zombies don't quit, and you probably won't be able to either."
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"L4D2 isn't going to change your mind if you thought it was just okay or didn't care for it. On the other hand if you and a handful of friends enjoyed joining up to defeat the land of the dead and surviving the thought of being a smorgasbord for the flesh eaters, then you will have nothing short of a blast with L4D2."
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,I think Valve and EA have stepped the game up in the sequel. I really believe they fully understand the value of players going online and playing the game with and against each other.
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"Left 4 Dead 2 is again one of the most intense, visceral and violent co-op shooters of this holiday season, but to be honest we were expecting some more additions. The game improves in every area its former game, but this is not enough to justify just 12 months of gap between the first and second iterations."
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"There is simply far more content by volume in this package than in the original. The core of Left 4 Dead may have lost some of its newness in the last 12 months, but the wealth of additions in this sequel ought to keep you blasting zombies and munching on brains for a good long while."
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"Building on what came before it technically and thematically, Left 4 Dead 2 proves itself a thrilling multiplayer experience fans would be foolish to pass up. The sequel may have arrived just a year after the first but the wealth of content and overall refinement means you wouldn¡¦t know to play it."
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"If you do already own and have played to death (excuse the pun) the original Left 4 Dead, the feeling that you've just purchased the same product again doesn't take very long to start tugging at your coat-tails. [Christmas 2009, p.110]"
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,Left 4 Dead 2 is a superb multiplayer game providing a great level of variety and replay value.
2009,Left 4 Dead 2,"Left 4 Dead 2 may have lost some of that new zombie smell, but its cooperative play is still among the best."
2009,Uncharted 2,Spread across twenty-six chapters is a story as playful and worthwhile as the gameplay.
2009,Uncharted 2,"Among Thieves is all about constant movement. And even movement on top of movement. It grabbed me from the beginning and didn't let go for twelve hours. Once I finished, all I could think about was playing it again. More than a defining game for the PS3, Uncharted 2 is a defining game of this console generation."
2009,Uncharted 2,"Its high production values shine out in its excellent visuals, brilliant sound design and intense and immersive gameplay."
2009,Uncharted 2,"Naughty Dog has created one of the true masterpieces of our time by combining engaging gameplay, an adrenaline pumping character driven story, and a solid addictive mutliplayer mode, which holds hundreds of hours of potential."
2009,Uncharted 2,Left me wishing I had enough time and luxury to jump straight back in and take the entire journey again. It's destined to enter the annals of gaming's classics in years to come.
2009,Uncharted 2,"With Among Thieves, Naughty Dog has shattered the proverbial bar it created with the 2007 original. This is quite possibly the best game to have graced the PS3, and without a doubt one of the greatest titles ever conceived."
2009,Uncharted 2,"Among Thieves is not only one of the best games of the year, it's also the benchmark for action games to come."
2009,Uncharted 2,"Uncharted 2 is easily one of the best games released on the PlayStation 3, but also finds itself as one of the best releases across any platform in recent memory."
2009,Uncharted 2,"Uncharted 2 is an exemplary title and one that smacks of a developer at the peak of its game. From every piece of cover and set-piece thrown in fiendishly to catch you unaware, to the expertly crafted multiplayer maps and top quality cut scenes, it is clear that a innumerable amount of dedication and painstaking precision has been squeezed out of the team to help make this the PS3's crowning moment."
2009,Uncharted 2,The level of polish is near perfect.
2009,Uncharted 2,"Lacklustre finale aside, this is everything you could ask of a headline third-person shooter and more."
2009,Uncharted 2,"This isn't just the best game released this year, or even the best Playstation 3 game yet, it's one of the best games released during this generation of consoles."
2009,Uncharted 2,"If there is one game for the Playstation 3 this year that I would say is a ""must buy"" Uncharted 2 is that game, it truly is one of the best games in years and could very well be the best Playstation 3 game of 2009."
2009,Uncharted 2,"It's truly an adventure from start to finish, and something that every gamer should experience."
2009,Uncharted 2,"A veritable master class of all-round game development. From a sensational single-player experience that never takes any short-cuts and maintains its story's mythological credibility right to the end to the co-operative online play to the robust, balanced, and just plain fun multiplayer modes, this is a package of content that more than earns its $60 price tag... [It's] this season's biggest PS3 victory. [Nov 2009, p.42]"
2009,Uncharted 2,"Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant. It looks amazing, plays like a dream and the voice-acting/story-telling will hook you in right from the off. PS3 officially has it's a killer-app and a million tears are shed by 360 fanboys."
2009,Uncharted 2,"Unless you're born without thumbs, eyes or a sense of humour, it's obvious that Uncharted 2 is a 10/10 game after two minutes of the first level...It's the most complete, polished and fun adventure game - and maybe just game - on PS3, and it's absolutely essential. [Nov 2009, p.101]"
2009,Uncharted 2,"Could use many words to describe Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, but I will just use one. Too beautiful."
2009,Uncharted 2,"Whether or not the multiplayer sticks, however, is arguably a footnote, because at the core of Uncharted 2 is an action-adventure masterpiece whose minor flaws are washed away on a tide of rhythm and spectacle - one that would still be an essential experience even without the option to pull your friends off cliffs and play capture-the-heirloom."
2009,Uncharted 2,"It takes elements from a lot of games - the exploration of Tomb Raider, climbing of Prince of Persia/Assassin's Creed, combat from Gears of War and stealth from Splinter Cell, yet it amalgamates all of these elements perfectly into one package. You can't compare it to any other game."
2009,Uncharted 2,"Uncharted 2 does not reinvent the gaming language, but pushes this genre to new limits. If you don't have a PS3, buy one to play this game."
2009,Uncharted 2,"Naughty Dog have created an amazing movie adventure on the PS3 with unparalleled graphics, fantastic dialogue and amazing platforming elements. There is no need to wait for the film version of this game, as it's already arrived in everyone's living room. Unmissable."
2009,Uncharted 2,"The A.I. is a little suspect, the camera can be stubborn, and you will die your fair share of cheap deaths. But it's still a fantastic effort and Naughty Dog deserves full credit for building upon the momentum of the first installment. PS3 owners should definitely experience it, especially if they liked the original."
2009,Uncharted 2,"Uncharted 2 is simply a vast improvement over its predecessor, and it's a damn great PS3 game. Let's leave the ""are games art?"" question for another time; what Uncharted 2 proves is that games are, at the very least, craft. Just as Raiders is Spielberg at the top of his game, Uncharted 2 is Naughty Dog at the top of theirs, and further proof that they are masters of their craft. [Grade = A+]"
2009,Uncharted 2,"The spectacular combination of generation-defining visuals, high adventure and cinematic intensity makes Uncharted 2 absolutely essential. There aren't any reasons not to own this game. [Nov 2009, p.64]"
2009,Uncharted 2,"The sequel to the masterfully crafted Uncharted: Drake's Fortune manages to up the notch to a whole new level, the result being the best adventure we've seen on this generation of console hardware. Praise be infinite when looking at the different aspects of the Uncharted 2 experience: fantastic graphics, great cast of characters, superb level design, masterfully directed movie sequences, fun combat and a well told story all make up what is undoubtedly a landmark of game design. Add to this a great online co-op mode as well as fun multiplayer modes and you get a game that by itself is a reason to buy a PS3."
2009,Uncharted 2,"Uncharted 2 is one of the most memorable video games ever created. Not because it is particularly innovative, but because the mixture of shooting, climbing, creeping, thinking, laughing and simple astonishment works perfectly."
2009,Uncharted 2,Uncharted 2 is a magnificent example of how this generation can infuse movie production quality with enjoyable gameplay and maintain a sense of fluidity throughout the feature presentation. The sheer craft on display throughout every single moment deserves every accolade it receives; truly Naughty Dog has delivered a generation-defining experience that is worthy of buying/borrowing/stealing a PS3.
2009,Uncharted 2,"No game is perfect. But Among Thieves does so many things incredibly well, that any miniscule faults that may have crept in the final game don't matter at all. Gamers that buy Uncharted 2 will be breathless after playing through one of the most incredible and intense adventures ever. The dialogue and the humour are the icing on the cake."
2009,Uncharted 2,Uncharted 2 is not innovative. But everything in it is better than in the first chapter. And everything seems nearly perfect. It is simply the new standard for the action adventure genre. A perfect mix between single player and multiplayer and something that will pave a new way for videogames. Any other production in the future will have to look at it. As we said at the beginning: the perfect game doesn't exist...but Naughty Dog seems really interested in finding a way to bring it to us.
2009,Uncharted 2,"Among Thieves is not a reinvention of the genre, more a definition. A sumptuous adventure that enthrals from start to finish, a cast that you'll fall in love with and a tale that's better scripted, directed and paced than most Hollywood blockbusters. It is a testament to the extraordinary talent at Naughty Dog and a glorious celebration of what video games can be when they play to their enviable strengths."
2009,Uncharted 2,But the character interaction and the superb story will stay with players long after they've escaped its final trap.
2009,Uncharted 2,"Uncharted 2 is a ringing testament to the power of both games and storytelling. It pulls you in, keeps you engaged, and concludes with a thunderous bang."
2009,Uncharted 2,"The words ¡§cinematic experience¡¨ have been used to describe the game so often that they are probably clich_ by now, but it¡¦s something that simply must be said. I found myself saying ¡§just one more chapter¡¨ for hours; I never wanted to stop playing, and I never wanted the game to end."
2009,Uncharted 2,"Uncharted 2: Among Thieves is everything you could ask for in a videogame: immensely satisfying and challenging gameplay, a great story with likable characters, a stunning audio-visual experience, plenty of replayability, and by the time the game ends, the feeling that every dollar spent on buying the game was well worth it. [Grade = A+]"

I will not go as far to name it ""Game of the Century"" because it's a bold statement. However, it does take a spot on the short list of outstanding games that will be often copied but never reproduced."

It's designed in such a way that is completely the opposite of what most games in the genre have been doing, and yet, by taking a step back to a more traditional setup, it is without question the best game the genre has seen in a very long time. It is also without question the best looking console game I've ever seen, easily the best of the generation."

No, Uncharted 2 is not perfect, but it's closer than pretty much any other game out there these days."
2009,Uncharted 2,"Uncharted 2 has no rival on the PS3. There's no other game, despite Killzone 2 on the visuals, with the same level of quality as Naughty Dog's newest game. The rhythm of the game is fast-paced and action-packed, and includes some fun, well-thought-out dialogue. The game is almost perfect in every stage, and it has online coop and deathmatch; there's no doubt that it's one of the top three games for the PS3, and one of the five best games of this year."
2009,Uncharted 2,The streamlined nature of the story also helps keep the pace of the game up - and the game rarely takes a breather.

2009,Uncharted 2,"Gameplay mechanics have been smoothed out greatly, and Uncharted 2 is one of the few PS3 games that both requires no installation and loads quickly. Maps are very large, and several levels have high-speed chases, helicopter attacks, and has players jumping from rooftops."

Its only flaw is a lack of real innovation for the videogame culture, although entirely made up for by an incredible merging between gameplay and cinematics.

The multiplayer side is in our opinion not entirely necessary, although developed with care for details, and will provide even more fun on top of the 10+ hour single player experience."
2009,Uncharted 2,"Graphically stunning, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves is, first of all, an interactive adventure, one that feels like a movie and even has a storyline of a movie.
