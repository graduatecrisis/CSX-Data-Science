Year,Game,Review
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"A Batman game like never before. Fans will feel like they're dreaming, whereas everyone else has an incredibly large and in-depth world to enjoy and engage with. It doesn't get much better. [Issue#78, p.80]"
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"Arkham City is not just one of the best games of the year, but also one of the greatest comic book games of all time!"
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"Rocksteady Studios has done it again. It may not be perfect, but it has taken it's predecessor's place as the best superhero game of all time. One of the best that this year has to offer."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"Arkham City, on the other hand, is a game about saving a city, Gotham City, and the experience is all the better for it."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"Believe the hype. Arkham City is one of the most important games made for this generation and it's also a masterclass in design, execution and treatment."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"Arkham City easily beat its predecessor Arkham Asylum in every possible way. It's a must-have and a serious contender for the ""Game of the Year"" title."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"Arkham City is huge, filled with secrets, and if you're a big Batman fan you'll love all the appearances tossed in, both for the good and bad guys. The addition of a New Game Plus mode also provides an astounding amount of replay value, and if you're any kind of completionist, you'll spend dozens of hours exploring the city for every little secret it contains. It's easily one of the best titles I've played all year."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"Batman: Arkham City is a rare treat, much like its predecessor. Not only is it a great licensed game, it is quite possibly the best superhero game ever made."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"With one of the best open worlds in any game and an immaculate mix of great side missions, tons of content and a fantastic atmosphere, Batman: Arkham City stands among the greatest action experiences in recent times."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"A week after beating the main campaign (at which point, we dove right back to side missions), its final image is lodged in our heads. And that's okay, because every time we think of Arkham City, we smile."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"Arkham City is stuffed to the edge of the disc with content and replay value (in addition to the gigantic campaign there's an expanded Challenge Mode and New Game Plus), is incredible amounts of fun, is polished to perfection, has had real love poured into every aspect, and most importantly, it makes you feel like Batman."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"There's a real sense of progression to Arkham City in its gameplay, in its story, in the variety of its missions (the abundance of open world side-quests will keep you busy for a long, long time), and in the evolution of its pointy-eared protagonist, that really deserves to be commended."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"Stands head and shoulders over its previous efforts. Despite facing stiffer competition than its predecessor, Batman: Arkham City is easily the best Batman video game of all time."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"The richness of the world is helped by the fact that Arkham City is a stunning looking game. This is one of the most detailed, rich and vibrant open worlds ever created, whether you are gliding over its skyline or striding down the broken-down streets. Considering the size of the world, the rich detail of the interiors is incredible, putting many more linear games to shame."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"It's the best treatment of a comic book character outside of graphic novels ever. It's the best Action Adventure/Open World game ever. It's the best game I've played this year. And finally, it's the best superhero game you've ever played."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"Rocksteady delivers a new masterpiece, enhancing the original in almost every way. Batman Arkham City offers a better story, masterfully paced storytelling, more freedom, more surprises, secondary missions and tasks, an intensified combat with new moves... To sum it up, a follow-up that met our expectations, without forgetting the strengths of the original, and growing up to be a spot-on tale of adventure and excitement: a serious candidate for the GOTY title."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"Batman: Arkham Asylum was the greatest superhero game of all time. The sequel, Batman: Arkham City, is five times bigger and about a billion times better. You do the math."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"A wonderful, startlingly complete package tailored for the single player. In these days of multiplayer crowbarred into any old game, it's a relief, a bold statement of intent that Rocksteady have created such a supremely focused but hugely expansive video game. It's a brave, committed, confident piece of work."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,Rocksteady Studios surprised us all back in 2009 by delivering one of the best games that year with Batman: Arkham Asylum. This year they show us that they are a force to be reckoned with when Batman: Arkham City more than lives up to expectations; it surpasses them in what is a very strong contender for Game of the Year 2011. No multiplayer? Who gives a bats a**?
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"It might not rewrite the book on Batman video games, but when you're building off of such a strong position--and you're only shipping the second game with such similarities, rather than a third or fourth--it's hard to bicker too much about what changes the developers did or didn't make."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"Controlling Batman as he completely terrorizes his victims, whether via the invisible predator gameplay or the brutal combat, is an experience rivaled by few others. From its memorable Bourne Identity-esque opening to its shocking ending, Batman: Arkham City secures its place as my favorite superhero game since Freedom Force."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"It doesn't take the world's greatest detective to spot that this is an expertly crafted adventure, one that maintains a breathtaking pace and invigorating rhythm from beginning to end. Dizzyingly extensive and lovingly detailed, Rocksteady has created an intricate, spirited and unequalled playground worthy of one of the most iconic characters in modern fiction."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"This game could be one of the biggest and most enjoyable time sinks of the year. Arkham City not only lives up to the standards set by Arkham Asylum, it bests its predecessor in every way and stands tall as one of Batman's greatest moments. [Nov 2011]"
2011,Batman: Arkham City,Every aspect of the game has been improved in ways that made it difficult to put the controller down.
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"Unparalleled in its representation of the Bat, Batman: Arkham City is a pedigree of gaming making and content adaption that no Batman fan should be without."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"Even Catwoman's playable missions, which I initially considered to be a cheap selling gimmick, add a lot of value to this game. Her titillating character plays in a completely different manner to the Caped Crusader's and the change in tempo works well."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"A perfect sequel, and a near-perfect action game. It's stunning to look at (seriously, just watch the snow flakes hit his suit for a minute), plays as smooth as they come, offers an unprecedented sense of player-choice in an open-world, despite being caged in a makeshift prison, and harbors among the best voice-acting and scripting the Batman universe, and games, have ever seen. It's dark, brooding and relentless in adult themes, yet requires no gore to relay any of this."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"Brave, brutal, brilliant - the gold standard by which all future videogames should be judged. [Dec 2011, p.67]"
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"An outstanding sequel in every department, with stunning gameplay, an immersive world to explore and fantastically well-realised characterisation. The music and voice-acting is exemplary and the visuals are gorgeous. Batman: Arkham City is an incredibly well-crafted, labour of love and no mistake. In short, it's genius."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"As someone who doesn't really enjoy Superhero games, Arkham City and I hit it off from the word go, as I was pulled into the story and role of a crime fighting genius."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"Predictably and brilliantly mind-blowing. In every way that matters, this really is ""The Dark Knight"" to Arkham Asylum's ""Batman Begins."" [Christmas 2011, p.92]"
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"Sequels this good rarely come along. To best a game as technically and thematically sound as Arkham Asylum takes some doing and Rocksteady have delivered in spades. It matches its predecessor's narrative finesse, and excels in every other aspect. What it lacks it 'whoa' value, it makes up for with a host of side quests, collectibles and nods to Gotham's history that is sure to keep any Batman enthusiast occupied."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"Batman is coloer than ever in this all new adventure. You'll fly from one magnificent moment to the other, with absolutely no time for boredom. Batman: Arkham City offers you the ultimate package, the best of the best and has everything you can ever ask for from a superhero game."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"Improved gameplay, new mechanics, and an even stronger story denote whether you care about Batman or not, it's still a game worthy of your time. With some easter eggs possibly hinting at plots for a third game, let's hope Rocksteady isn't quite done with the Dark Knight."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"All in all, outside of a few minor issues, I couldn't ask for a better Batman experience. If Arkham City was a graphic novel, it would be considered a classic."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"The formula that Rocksteady started with Arkham Asylum has been all-but perfected in Arkham City. This game hits you hard, hits you where it hurts and leaves you begging for more."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"Batman: Arkham City is an absolute must for anyone who loved Arkham Asylum. If you didn't play that, then do that first because the storylines tie into each other."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"So now the stage has been set, the characters are all in place, the battle lines drawn, and Batman is up against his greatest challenge yet."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"Bigger, better and more versatile than its predecessor. Arkham City is a superb gaming achievement, and with it Rocksteady earns a rightful place in this generation's most talented developers."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"Not only is this a really amazing Batman title, it is a really amazing action adventure title overall. My only complaint is that some of the boss battles were a little annoying, however, the game overall is a masterpiece."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"Batman: Arkham City is an excellent production and undoubtedly one of the strong candidates for the ""game of tye year"" title. The sequel is a better game in all aspects. It doesn't allow you to step away from the screen due to great gameplay solutions, a really interesting story and rich content. I assure you that Arkham City isn't a game to be put on a shelf after one or two nights. If you're a fan of the pervious game, you don't need a recommendation. If you're new to the franchise - quickly get to know the entire series. I wish there were more games like this one."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"Rocksteady already proved that they're an amazing studio with Arkham Asylum, but with Arkham City they now belong to the Olympus of the Action/Adventure genre. This game is the ultimate superhero experience."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"Arkham City is better than its predecessor in every way. The gameworld, the move set and the story have all grown. The numerous subplots and villains that take the stage make this game almost too much of a good thing."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"Arkham City does what everyone hoped it would yet feared it couldn't; expand and improve on Arkham Asylum. Indeed, Arkham City is a bigger and better game in all regards, delivering an immaculately presented, rich, compelling play experience and gripping story while simultaneously respecting its source material's legacy and pushing the Batman myth further forward."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"Arkham City is a masterpiece. The improved free-flow combat system and various new gadgets contribute to brilliant gameplay, while a complex screenplay delivers a breathtaking experience. But it's the number and the characterization of villains and personalities that stand as an incredible surplus value."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"Combat is extremely fulfilling due to the fact that you can string together attacks, counters, gadget quick attacks, and special moves completely flawlessly."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"Batman: Arkham City isn't just better than Batman: Arkham Asylum, it's better than most games on the market."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"It's a belief in the character and, most importantly, a belief in itself that has seen the studio deliver one of the greatest Batman interpretations of all time. And you know what? Maybe even one of the best games ever."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"A great game, that successfully builds upon the foundation of the first title delivering us one of the best super heroes and action games around. It lacks highly memorable moments like the ones in the original game and delivers a quite disappointing final boss fight, but its incredible content richness and great gameplay make it an highly suggested buy."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"Rocksteady managed to clear up the few things that didn't work in Asylum and widen its scope. The result is another real Batman experience, offering an in-depth look on the charachter that even Nolan's movies (at least until now) cannot offer, and an unforgettable gaming experience."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"Batman: Arkham City is easily the most immersive superhero game I've played since those open-world Spider-Man games, and quite possibly a contender for Game of the Year."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"Batman: Arkham City isn't just better than Arkham Asylum, it's one of the best game ever made and it's also one of the very few satisfying experiences that has been produced in the last few years."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"It is not as surprising as Arkham Asylum, but it improves upon it, updating and enhancing all its elements, and also allowing us to feel like Batman patrolling the troubled streets of Gotham. Although with few new features in gameplay, it is the best Batman game ever made, and one of the best games of this year."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"Arkham City feels like a logical extension of its predecessor, wholly embracing and expanding upon all the elements that made it great. It most certainly is the definitive Batman game, but to leave it there would be to damn it with faint praise. Simply put, if you admire painstakingly-realized worlds rich with secrets and game mechanics that never cease to surprise you, then you it to yourself to experience Arkham City. Your interest in the source material is irrelevant."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"Arkham City continues to amaze. If you thought Arkham Asylum was great, City is even better. Gliding around the open world is great fun and the combat system has surprising depth in it. The story suffers a bit from the sheer number of many supervillains in it, but otherwise Arkham City is one of the best games of 2011. [Oct 2011]"
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"Finishing Batman: Arkham City was an immensely rewarding experience. It's a shame the main story didn't last a bit longer. However, we weren't bothered by this, because the game doesn't shy away from offering a ton of content even when you're done with your first playthrough."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"The new Batman is bigger, better and much more dangerous than Arkham Asylum. The atmosphere is brilliantly designed like Batman himself. There are wonderful side-quests and well designed puzzles as well. Players that did not play Batman: Arkham Asylum will feel left alone a bit because there is no real tutorial."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"Arkham City and The Dark Knight (film) have something much more important in common: They're so sublime, they render their predecessors nearly forgettable by comparison."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"Great sequel to a already great game. Lots of variety, all of the tools Batman has to offer, great graphics, and a stunning atmosphere transform this into a must-have title for Batman fans."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"Arkham City handles its side-stories gloriously. [Christmas 2011, p.102]"
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"Batman: Arkham City isn't the surprise that the first game was and instead has to live up to the hype and remain fresh by bringing in new ideas whilst building on the old ones. This sequel handles the challenge admirable, making for what is so far the closest thing gamers have to a definitive Batman experience."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"Arkham City is a wonderful game that we expected it to be but regrettably despite all the enhancements it introduces it is not clearly better than Arkham Asylum. [November 2011, p.36]"
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"Arkham City was one of the most anticipated games of the year and ends upbeing one of the best. This is an exemplary sequel, better than the firstgame in every respect."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"With a gripping fighting system, lots of diversity and a great atmosphere, Batman: Arkham City is one of the best superhero games out there. Some may even say it is one of the best games of all time."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"The successor to the critically acclaimed Batman Arkham Asylum is bigger, looks better and contains even more content in form of more villains, more riddles and more side quests then its predecessor. Though it's near perfect in almost every way, the large amount of characters included from the Batman universe paradoxically becomes a flaw as there's too many of them to present them all in a logical and deserving way. Still, Batman Arkham City is a wonderful masterpiece that should not be missed."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"An action-heavy realization of what makes Batman such a compelling hero, complete with a fascinating world, a smart story and loads of rewards for exploring it all."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"Whether you loved the previous game, or have had no experience with Rocksteady's Batman series up until now, Arkham City belongs on your shelf, in your console, and in your life."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"Batman is back, better than ever with new tools, new areas to explore and an exiting adventure. Arkham City is better that it's predecessor in every possible way and in the end one of the best games this generation."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"Batman: Arkham City is about as good as it gets when it comes to action adventure video games. Engaging storyline, slick combat, superb visuals and deep single player campaign mode makes Batman: Arkham City a must own title this holiday season."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"The best Batman video game? Certainly. The best comics video game? Very likely. The best video game of the year 2011? Who knowsÿ The sure thing is that Arkham City is a paradise for all of you in love with dark worlds thick with interesting characters, events and great gameplay. Bravo!"
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"Batman: Arkham City is the best superhero game available, it is a perfect example of how a license should be used in a game. It's not quite as open world as I would have liked, but it is polished to near perfection."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"If you had nearly any kind of fun with Rocksteady's previous effort or you're just looking to jump into a good comic book game, then Arkham City should be at or near the top of your list."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"Arkham City is a display of power. Its predecessor was one of the best licensed games ever, but it's as if Rocksteady has found another gear, just as we thought they were already running at top speed. It's an amazing game, and one of the greatest releases this year."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"This ""broader scope"" is actually where Arkham City delivers tenfold upon expectations. While in Arkham Asylum, players got a really good sense of Batman ""trapped."" Now, Arkham City isn't so much about Batman being trapped in the city, but about the inmates being trapped inside Arkham City with Batman. And we couldn't be happier about it."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"So if Arkham Asylum was defined by its limits, Arkham City is a careful, considered exercise in stripping those limits away. Its open city lets players be a different kind of Batman to the stealthy predator of Asylum ¡V this is the Batman of dropped smoke pellets and theatrical getaways, the Batman with an ear to the ground for the strong picking on the weak, and the Batman who floats above the city with a gothic majesty."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"Weighed down by bloat though it may be, Batman: Arkham City is still one of the year's finest games, filled with the capacity to surprise even players who've skulked through every inch of its predecessor."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"Not just the best superhero game, but one of the greatest action adventures ever made - set in an expansive and engrossing virtual world unlike any other."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"From the speedy exhilaration of soaring high above the streets to the atmospheric thrill of discovering long-forgotten secrets in the tunnels below Gotham, this is an unforgettable adventure that will keep you coming back to the cape and cowl long after you've seen the credits roll."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"No matter what though, what can't be denied is the quality and entertainment-factor of the overall product. Whether you like Batman or not, you'll find much to like here. In the matter of only two games, Rocksteady has managed to create a Batman franchise that provides us with not only the best videogame incarnation of the Caped Crusader, but the best videogame incarnation of any superhero."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"Rocksteady has made the greatest Batman game ever crafted, and they've done that before. But breathing life into a staggeringly beautiful world; one which hums not only with opportunity, but ambition? That's a new trick altogether."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"The game doesn't benefit from the novelty of Rocksteady's first, pitch-perfect effort, but based on the quality and beauty of Gotham's pair of correctional institutes, we're perfectly happy to be incarcerated again."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"It's a role-playing game in the most literal sense of the phrase, a game in which you're encouraged to give in to the fantasy, and to see what life is like when it's composed of rooftop brawls and zip-line getaways. Animations, traversal mechanics, takedowns: they're all building towards the same thing. In Arkham City, you become Batman."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"A fantastic romp with the Dark Knight through a suitably dark and depressing city, with your fists, your toys and a fantastic new take on the story. While it engages more sandbox gameplay, it ultimately is a true sequel to the Arkham Asylum in both feel and presentation and is a worthy purchase, even if it isn't that long or that large."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,Batman: Arkham City is still one of those games that will have a strong presence on list for Game of the Year and it deserves that kind of attention but it didn't quite grab me the same way Arkham Asylum did.
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"When all is said and done, Batman: Arkham City is an enjoyable game with plenty of content to explore. Just know that despite a fresh coat of paint, there's nothing really new here. If you enjoyed Arkham Asylum and simply want more of the same, you're going to love Arkham City. Those who were hoping for an evolution in play, however, are going to be left wanting."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"It doesn't quite reach the highs of its predecessor, but Arkham City rarely sinks low. When it's all said and done, you'll be begging for more, but not because there wasn't enough. It is just too damn fun to be The Bat."
2011,Batman: Arkham City,"Even if there is still some reason to quibble here and there, Arkham City is undoubtedly the result of which we dreamed, rich and surprising in many ways. A feat which makes it a must-see title of 2011."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"This epic role-playing game might be Bethesda's best game yet, and offers an unique and spectacular world filled with fun. The freedom ensures a great experience for both the casual and hardcore gamer, as you're free to play the game how you like."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"A magnificent hive of creativity and technical clout, and holds a world so open it frequently threatens to overwhelm. Skyrim is forever charming and consistently engaging, and will carve a completely different adventure for every player put under its dazzling spell."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,A masterpiece of free-form gaming; one of the most ambitious games of this generation.
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"If you're looking for just one RPG to pass the time with this year (and probably next), Skyrim is definitely it."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is so immense and chock-full of content that we could conceivably rant about it for pages, but to do so would only detract from the time you should spend physically playing it."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,Skyrim is the game that I would highly recommend to damn near anyone. It's not too hard to figure out and it's got such an enormous amount of stuff to do that anyone would be able to see what is so special about the game.
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"Simply put, this is a beautiful game. The scenery on display here is almost unparalleled in the genre. From scenic viewpoints atop snowy mountains to the rushing streams and waterfalls I found myself often just stopping and admiring for a while."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"Skyrim, an absolute masterpiece, the more you invest in the game, the more you get out of it. A truly epic game that deserves all of the plaudits. It is more than a just game, it is an experience."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is a remarkable achievement that despite from a few niggling bugs is an undertaking unlike any other. This could quite easily be the only game you purchase for the next several months and still provide you with a complete sense of satisfaction. There are few titles that offer such an incredible level of value without resorting to multiplayer and for that I applaud Bethesda. Skyrim is a role-playing masterpiece.
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"Skyrim lets these rough edges show, because the element of chaos lets players feel like the game is happening to them, and they are alive in it-not just cogs in a pre-fab Game Experience. That's what sets Skyrim apart from some of its contemporaries. Where many games with lavish production values seek to direct players' imaginations, Skyrim seeks to ignite them."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,The greatest thing about Skyrim is that Bethesda has created a world whereour imagination does not have to fill in the blanks: you just have toexplore them and live them.
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"Skyrim is completely and utterly addictive in every aspect and quite possibly, I'll say it, the greatest RPG of all time. It affords you the luxury of playing it your way and doesn't try to constrain you. It wants you to get lost in a winter wonderland and believe me, you will. Kiss the rest of your life goodbye."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"After a trajectory of excellency with Oblivion and Fallout 3, Bethesda reaches a new level this generation, showing they have reached maturity in their unique way of making worlds. Thanks to their generosity, will and ambition, single players fans looking for huge worlds of high adventure can still keep dreaming. Skyrim is an absolute triumph."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"If a deep combat system, an engaging plot, a wonderful cast of characters and a stunning, open-ended game world sounds like something you might be interested in, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim should be at the top of your list."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"The game's greatest accomplishment is that it is a paradise of escapism, a lavish love letter to immersion. Diving into Skyrim's world feels both thrilling and comforting, like riding a rollercoaster or swimming in the ocean. There is very little padding. There are very few scripted quests that aren't worth experiencing."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"An absolutely first-rate roleplaying game that combines an abundance of content with an abundance of quality. The outdated design elements are unfortunate but not so distracting that it ruins the depth of the story, the openness of the setting, or the visceral joys of combat."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"A testament to the strength and importance of games that create living, breathing worlds, while affirming the value of long-term commitment over instant gratification. The absence of companion control, though a glaring flaw, ultimately does not spoil its purposeful, refined, and genre-defining design. Endlessly replayable and a phenomenal landmark in gaming, Skyrim deserves a place in every true gamer's collection."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"Like every other game in the series, Skyrim is going to eat hundreds of hours of my gaming time over the next few years. It has that sense of wonder that makes he Elder Scrolls games so great, and with the changes to skills, the Shouts, and dual-wielding, I think any gamer is going to have a lot of fun with Skyrim (and its eventual expansions) as well."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"Skyrim is sprawling, generous, gorgeous and ambitious. It does what few games can: thoroughly follow through on its ambitions. It could be possible to play only this game for the next year and still not discover all of its mysteries."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"If you can only buy one game this holiday season and want your absolute money's worth, there's no looking past what is arguable the industry benchmark for sandbox and emergent gameplay with player-choice at its helm, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. A work of sheer genius."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"Take what you loved in Morrowind, cut out what you hated in Oblivion, multiply by 10, mix well, and there you go: you get Elder Scrolls V Skyrim. With its deep background, enticing prophecy, new gameplay mechanisms, Skyrim mesmerizes us into diving in its world completely and forgetting about the usual shortcomings of the series (except the poor animations - they really are too bad to be overlooked). If you like the series, but don't love it, get this game. If you love the series, you better get yourself a pair of fresh undies, and fast."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"Skyrim is one of the most gargantuan undertakings gamers will experience all year. The sheer size of the adventure, both in terms of its environment and in the amount of activities available to the player, is mind-blowing."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"It is not often I get lost in a game like I did with Skyrim. Everything about this game screams quality and adventure. While Bethesda hasn't exactly got a track record for delivering bug-free games at launch, this has been a pleasant, polished and amazing experience so far. A much improved third-person view, amazing music, a living breathing world, a menu-system that's amazing and a game filled with interesting stuff to do. Truly a masterpiece."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"Skyrim is bigger, better, deeper than it's already excellent predecessor and a true masterpiece. This is not only a contender to be the game of the year, but maybe even the best role-playing game ever."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"Skyrim is the kind of game you can completely lose yourself in for at least a hundred hours, even if you somehow manage to complete the main quest in fewer than twenty. If you aren't normally drawn to role-playing games, get over it - to miss out on this extraordinary gaming experience would be positively criminal."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is breathtaking, engrossing and deep. With gameplay and visual improvements, Bethesda set a new standard in The Elder Scrolls series with Skyrim, and with the action/RPG genre. This most certainly should be the game of the year."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim may not deliver on every hope, wish or fervent demand you've been formulating ever since you realized how many flaws Oblivion was carefully hiding with its immense charm, but it most certainly lives up to the name Elder Scrolls and will easily qualify for millions of gamers' best-of-the-year lists."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"Skyrim may frustrate you at times, but it will work its way inside your skin and replace the marrow of your bones. It never gives you an opportunity to neatly stop playing. Even if you manage to tear yourself away, the locations and the people will rattle around in your head. It'll give you stories to tell your friends, (although you should remember that many people simply won't be interested), and it'll give you an entire region to bend, beautifully slowly, to your will."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"No other game I know of operates with this many moving parts to create such an immense world filled with this much choice in how you engage its excellent, endless fiction. It's one thing when a game offers dozens of hours of gameplay; it's quite another when that gameplay is good enough you'll want to live in its world for that long."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"This is the deepest, lovliest world ever created for a single player to explore, and one that no one should deny themselves. This is a game about following Emerson's advice, leaving the trail and finding that the most powerful force on Earth or Tamriel isn't fire or sword, but the ever-insistent desire to know what lies beyond."

2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"So back to the big question at hand: is Skyrim too much like Oblivion to the point where it loses credibility? In a word, no. If Skyrim had the exact same game engine and mechanics of Oblivion it would most likely be a contender for game of the year. But by addressing every issue from the last game and improving everything else, Skyrim leaves little room for error for the next game in the series."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,This is easily one of the best RPGs to come out in this generation of consoles. You must own this game.

A strong contender to the title of best game of the year and of the entire generation."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"Whether you're wondering around the wilderness, enjoying the melodies from a bard in an inn, casually strutting about town, or going head to head with a dragon; the music and sound effects add to the immersion in the same way they do in a Lord of the Rings or Star Wars film."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,Every aspect of Skyrim is done to pinpoint perfection and has the makings of a game that will be played and enjoyed by millions for years to come.
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is a role-playing fans paradise.
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"The defining element of Skyrim is the choices that are given to players in every conceivable way. Weapon upgrades, character development, storyline progress, solving quests, exploration, NPC interaction, are all impressively crafted elements that almost feel like separate games molded into one unforgettable adventure."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,Skyrim is one of the most captivating role-playing games of this generation. Each setting looks amazingly special and the artistic side of the game is just brilliant. This game is deeper and bigger than anything we have seen this year.

2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"Improved from Oblivion in almost every way, Skyrim delivers an adventure beyond everything we've seen till now in the genre."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"Just about the finest example of core, yet accessible, Western RPG and open-ended gameplay. In The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, Bethesda have realised the game they wanted to make since the inception of HD gaming."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"Skyrim is Bethesda's magnum opus. The game combines the best elements from Morrowind, Oblivion and Fallout 3 and makes it an outstanding adventure. The quality and quantity on offer here is incredible."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"Even with these issues there is only one way to describe Skyrim and that is epic. There is so much to see, do and experience that it's exceedingly easy to get lost in the fantasy. It's not a remarkable or radical departure from Oblivion, so if that game left you cold, Skyrim will too. For those who embraced that lifestyle, you will find Skyrim is Oblivion+++."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"Where Oblivion may have caused many to sit on the fence when faced with any new Elder Scrolls release, Skyrim stands tall in redemption. It is, without any shadow of doubt, the best RPG experience available right now."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"This is a title that deserves a spot in your gaming library. The environments are stunning, the level of control you have over your own experience is amazing and, simply put, Skyrim is an epic experience."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"Sometimes I feel like role-playing games have forgotten about the whole ""roleplaying"" part of the genre. So it's refreshing to play a game like Skyrim that imbues so much effort into immersing you in its world. Quit your job. Divorce your spouse. Give your children up for adoption. Do whatever you need to do to find the time to play Skyrim."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"Glitches aside, Skyrim is a big, beautiful game, that will overwhelm with its physical and emotional depths. And after thirty-five hours of playing I feel like I've only experienced a hint of what the Skyrim world has to offer. I love the way it manages to combine sandbox-style gameplay without sacrificing story progression or big political moments that lend credence to the experience of a real culture."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"Featuring the same kind of thrilling freedom of choice The Elder Scrolls series is known for along with beautiful visuals and a stirring soundtrack, playing Skyrim is a rare kind of intensely personal, deeply rewarding experience, and one of the best role-playing games yet produced."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"But, assuming you're fine with that, then Skyrim is, in a word, amazing. Sure, it has its problems, it's oddities, and again some of these are just down to how the game is made and others just need some extra patching or work done to it. There is always a danger with games like these that you'll get bored, or you'll lose your drive - Bethesda have done a wonderful job of staving off that feeling in this game."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"It's one of the biggest, most content rich games I've ever had the pleasure of playing."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"If you're an Elder Scrolls veteran, you'll already know what you're in for. This is not the next evolutionary stage of the series: rather a loving refinement of what made Oblivion and the now-aged PC title Morrowind so special. It's those games with better voice acting, a slicker interface, a richer world and an improved story. It's also the most polished and user friendly games in the series, with smarter character progression and a gentler learning curve."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,Skyrim delivers a mind blowing level of content wrapped in a package that would be worth the experience at twice the price.

2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim is extremely ambitious, and at its core, extremely successful. While overreaches in certain areas, it has much to offer in terms of freedom and volume of content. When you look back on the experience, it's not the rough spots that'll stand out, but the broad, heroic feeling of being the powerful and change-affecting center of a richly constructed world."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"The best Elder Scrolls game released so far. The atmosphere is just amazing and the fights against the dragons cause goosebumps every single time. There are still some stupid leftovers from Oblivion, but most of the errors from the previous game have been fixed. [Nov 2011]"
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"There is a substantial amount of content in Skyrim and while it's easy to nitpick on all the flaws present, Bethesda has still delivered a product that even a jaded gamer like myself can still be awestruck by."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"I've dabbled in Elder Scrolls games before, but they always seemed to be the wrong combination of intimidatingly huge and mechanically clunky (not to mention kind of ugly). Skyrim is the chapter that's finally pulled me in, and suddenly I find myself smitten with the series. Not just the games, but the lore, and the insane level of thought that's been invested in the world of Tamriel."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,Quotation forthcoming.
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"Easily in line for a game of the year nod and one of the finest adventures this generation has seen. [Issue#79, p.64]"
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"A picture-perfect playground designed to engender pure love in those willing to lose themselves within it. [Christmas 2011, p.90]"
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"Skyrim is epic in every sense, there is no other word for it. It is one of the biggest and best RPG ever made."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,Skyrim's pretty damn awesome.
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"Easily Bethesda's best game yet, with an impossibly detailed and beautiful game world and a new gold standard for Western style role-playing."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"Skyrim is huge, beautiful and absorbing, filled with secrets, quests and adventure. Even though the story has its flaws and quests offer little freedom of choice, Skyrim still stands out as one of the best open world RPGs to date."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"With 300 hours of gameplay, some mechanics refinement and a complete new world, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is the perfect ""sequel"" to Oblivion. An epic game that RPG fans should not miss."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,Surely the greatest console RPG of the year and maybe one of the best chapters in the Elder Scrolls series. Skyrim is definitely one of the best gaming experiences of this generation.
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"In The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, the snow-capped peaks of the Nords relentlessly beckon me back to pry loose one more artifact, dungeon or secret. Skyrim's lavish world is tailor-made for adventurers who are eager to satisfy their curiosity of what is beyond the next bend in the road, not those who want to know which attribute scores play into which skill. There's little question that this is a gorgeous epic, but it's also a stark reminder of what it leaves behind."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"The bottom line is that, most of the time, Skyrim is a genuinely amazing game."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"Skyrim is one of the finest embodiments of an open world RPG, as there is never a dearth of places to go or quests to complete. What Skyrim lacks in tough role-playing choices, it more than compensates for with interesting things to do."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"Whether you're slashing a dragon's wings, raising the dead back to life, or experimenting at the alchemy table, Skyrim performs the most spectacular of enchantments: the one that causes huge chunks of time to vanish before you know it."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"These moments are why you play Skyrim, because in the instance of breathless excitement, triumph or discovery, you invest completely in its world."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"In the end, Skyrim will be hailed as both the best and worst title of the year depending on whom you ask. RPG gamers who look for subtle storytelling and endless replay value are going to love every minute. But gamers that have even a slight problem with impatience will quickly become frustrated. However, even the most devoted naysayer has to admit that Skyrim is at the top of its genre, and that's no small feat."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"Skyrim is easily one of the strongest and best examples of the Western RPG, and it further establishes Bethesda's reputation as one of the most talented and creative forces in the gaming industry. Moreover, it offers players a world so vast they could easily become lost in it, and so beautiful they may never wish to return from it."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"The latest Elder Scrolls has such confidence in the allure of its open-world structure that it shirks the need to compete. And, it largely succeeds in being better than the sum of its parts."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"Quests are better structured, the dramatic moments abound, and the atmosphere of the northern title is incredibly immersive. There are also, inevitably, small bugs, pathfinding problems, inconsistencies, repeated load times and other annoying issues which punctuate the experience bit by bit."
2011,The Elder Scrolls V,"Oblivion is good, but it's a flawed good. It's a different experience in many ways to previous Elder Scrolls games, but, at the same time, it's still the familiar world Elder Scrolls fans know and love. It has the usual kickass story, but the difficulty curve is a bit wobbly, to say the least, and, in general, it's a story of give and take."
2011,Portal 2,"A truly spectacular sequel that reaches previously unthinkable heights. Portal 2 is an experience to be cherished and already a strong contender for the best game of 2011. [Issue#72, p.78]"
2011,Portal 2,"Portal 2 is really a worthy successor to Portal, and is a great example of a very well-designed, well-implemented game. I recommend it highly."
2011,Portal 2,"There is no such thing as perfection, no matter how much we strive for it, therefore a couple of minor niggles do not distract from a top score. Portal 2 is the Game of the Year so far, it will take something special for it not to take that accolade. Sometimes the anticipation of a games release can leave the final thing feeling a little flat. That is not the case here as Portal 2 lives up to all expectations and then some."
2011,Portal 2,It's hard to overstate my satisfaction. Play Portal 2 as soon as you can.
2011,Portal 2,"If there was ever any doubt that Portal could be expanded into a big, narrative experience with all the bells and whistles of a mainstream gaming hit, have no fear. Valve solved that puzzle with Portal 2."
2011,Portal 2,"Impatience aside, Portal 2 is an exceptionally well-crafted, intelligent, entertaining, humorous game. You will laugh. You will feel like a freaking genius. You will want more. And yes, you will probably be hearing quotes from Portal 2 for the next three years."
2011,Portal 2,"Sporting some of the best writing and voice work in years (as well as some deviously designed puzzles), Portal 2's single-player campaign is superior to its predecessor in every way. It's the co-op mode, however, that makes this 2011's first must-play game -- even for those gamers that don't like first-person or puzzle games."
2011,Portal 2,"Portal 2 couldn't be Portal, but it's the next best thing. It's a longer, funnier, more emotional plummet through Aperture's perplexing laboratory, and its meticulous detail, perfect pacing, and kinetic, mind-expanding puzzles make it a blazingly memorable experience. It's so damn memorable, already feel nostalgic about it."
2011,Portal 2,"Genius is an often overused word but Valve's work on Portal 2 is genius in the truest sense. The studio has exhibited exceptional creativity in the game, even compared to some of its other masterpieces. If we could give it 11/10, we would."
2011,Portal 2,"Portal 2 is a masterful execution of one of the key components of gaming, fun. Valve has really outdone themselves this time, and managed to make me say,""What's episode 3?"""
2011,Portal 2,"While it's unclear if we'll ever see GLaDOS or Chell again, this much is certain: Portal 2 is one of the best games of this generation."
2011,Portal 2,"Never before has a review embargo had us screaming inside so badly that our mind eventually goes hoarse. We've wanted to shout from the rooftops about how Portal 2 not only betters the original Portal, but completely annihilates it...If you thought the original Portal was a masterpiece, prepare to have your mind blown."
2011,Portal 2,"Bigger, tougher, and funnier, Portal 2 manages to expand on its perfectly succinct predecessor in just about every way. Boasting two excellent campaigns, each rife with satisfying puzzles and even more satisfying ""Eureka!"" moments, Valve's latest is an absolute must-own, plain and simple."
2011,Portal 2,"A mere ten minutes here will yield more memorable moments than you're likely to squeeze out of the entirety of most other games this year. In all aspects of its design, Portal 2 is genius."
2011,Portal 2,"It's a work of masterful craft, mechanically constructed with military precision, artistically wrapped in a tremendous story and environment. Most impressively, its achievements feel effortless."
2011,Portal 2,"Portal 2 is a masterpiece. Valve did everything possible to evolve the original concept, creating an almost perfect experience only disturbed by a couple of minor issues. With both an intense single-player mode and a perfect co-op multiplayer Portal 2 is a true must-buy."
2011,Portal 2,"Despite being so much bigger than the original, I actually felt a little melancholy once Portal 2 was over, simply because it's so rare to find a game this smart, this funny, and this rich with detail. It elevates Portal from an odd, memorable experiment to one of the most significant series in Valve's stable with a unique voice and an incredible level of quality that all developers should aspire to."
2011,Portal 2,"Valve has created a masterpiece in Portal 2. The depth of content, the mind-bending mechanics and fantastic experience are almost certain to satisfy ardent fans of the first game; and to all newcomers to the series, it's as simple as this: prepare to have your mind blown. Over and over again."
2011,Portal 2,"While it's worth replaying to catch the dialogue you missed the first time round - a spectacular rarity in any game - and to hunt out the hidden Rat Man rooms, there isn't enough variety in the way you solve puzzles to sustain repeat runthroughs. We're going to need DLC, and plenty of it, to keep our co-op partnership going."
2011,Portal 2,"Portal 2 is a triumph in every sense of the word, a wonderful experience from start to finish and one that you won't soon forget."
2011,Portal 2,Portal 2 is hands-down the best game thus far released in 2011.
2011,Portal 2,Portal 2 is better in every possible way when compared to its predecessor. The writing is brilliant and the voice actors have managed once again to bring the robots to life perfectly. Valve proves to be an amazing developer and brings us what could be the best game this generation has ever known.
2011,Portal 2,A joy to play. There is no other way to describe it.
2011,Portal 2,"Without a doubt, Portal 2, if not the best game of 2011, will be amongst the top of the heap when the year closes out. The fantastic story, excellent pacing, interesting and engaging puzzles and other incredible facets to the game make it one that people should experience at any cost."
2011,Portal 2,"It starts slowly and at first might seem like an expansion, but it has many epic moments waiting for you. It is not the perfect game, but comes dangerously close."
2011,Portal 2,"With Portal 2, Valve willfully defied common logic by creating an exceptionally detailed yet mainstream friendly experience out of, essentially, a puzzle game."
2011,Portal 2,"By concentrating on iteration rather than re-design, Valve have created a sequel that improves upon the original and yet stays true to its memory. The puzzles, the story and the expert way in which players are taught to use the new tools all combine to create what is very possibly the most absorbing game the puzzle genre has ever seen."
2011,Portal 2,"Valve took a great concept, and turned it into an interesting, intellectual marvel that stopped the gaming world. They then took that marvel and made it better again. Portal 2 is an achievement in writing, and I'll be stunned should it be robbed of appropriate accolades. Not many games this year will be as funny, charming and intellectually puzzling as Portal 2, and that's no surprise ¡V because it's so damn good."
2011,Portal 2,"You're not going to find better writing, dialogue, and perfect voice acting anywhere else. The script is so brilliant and was the single reason I kept playing. The wit and humor is so amazing that you'll be laughing out loud at some of the one liners thrown your way. I'm elated that it wasn't just a longer drawn out Portal experience and has its own merits to be a game all of its own."
2011,Portal 2,"Fantastic writing, excellent gameplay, and a level of polish and playtesting so high that you know it's got to be a Valve title, Portal 2 is simply a game that can not be missed."
2011,Portal 2,"The gameplay, while brilliant and innovative, can drag a bit at times, but the writing carries the game through those times, and the mostly great graphics and perfect audio seal the deal. There's a lot more content than most may be expecting, too. On the whole, it's an amazing game from a company known for making amazing games. It's a truly worthwhile sequel that lives up to its predecessor, and that alone is rare enough that the game is worth checking out."
2011,Portal 2,"Portal 2 is the great game that fans hoped. GLaDOS is back to make our life difficult. It doesn't allow us out of this hell that is the Aperture laboratory. Vegetation, more puzzles and many new challenges for one or two players."
2011,Portal 2,Portal 2 isn't dessert - it's a delectable multi-course meal at a five-star restaurant. Make your reservation now.
2011,Portal 2,"Overall, Portal 2 is an absolutely amazing title. Everyone (including myself) was disappointed when Portal 2 was delayed earlier this year, however, it was more than worth the wait. Portal 2 is a masterpiece that I can see myself playing for years."
2011,Portal 2,The game's quality stays consistently outstanding throughout; there isn't a minute of filler content to be found anywhere in single-player or co-op.
2011,Portal 2,"Makes the original look like the prototype it was. It's filled with a larger cast of characters vividly brought to life through brilliant writing and some of the best voice acting in video games...From the beginning of the single-player story to the end of the co-op mode, Portal 2 is a novel, unforgettable experience."
2011,Portal 2,"Portal 2 may be the best game of 2011. It may be the best game of all-time. It is certainly the best game you can play right now. I loved every moment I spent with Portal 2. I'm even enjoying looking at the game sitting on my shelf knowing how much fun I will have again someday when I revisit Aperture Science, alone or hopefully with a friend who may not have played the game. Portal 2 proves that you don't have to kill things to make a great game and more importantlyÿscience is fun!"
2011,Portal 2,"Portal 2 is a top notch experience throughout. Whether you're a fan of the first game, looking for a grade A title, or simply looking for an experience other than the myriad of shooters out there today which, with Portal 2, you can't go wrong here. If the story doesn't keep you coming back the cooperative multiplayer or puzzle based gameplay will. Portal 2 is another great title from Valve and definitely worth the price of admission."
2011,Portal 2,"It is engaging, clever, genuinely funny, and all-around unique. The puzzles are always a challenge, but none of them go into the realm of the impossible ¡V clever thinking and analysis is always enough to solve them, and gives a sense of accomplishment when you get it right."
2011,Portal 2,"Wonderful humour, a thrilling story, innovative new gameplay elements and hours of mind-boggling puzzles - Portal 2 is a masterpiece. If you liked the prequel, you will love this one."
2011,Portal 2,"Portal 2 includes groundbreaking gameplay, a collection of deep and nuanced characters, a completely insane story, and some incredible gaming moments you'll probably never forget."
2011,Portal 2,"Portal 2 has an enormous warmth that makes it easy to adore, even when you're up against its many frustrating brainteasers. An amazing gameplay experience merged with a very unique, engrossing concept. Truly an exceptional experience that almost any gamer should give at least one go."
2011,Portal 2,"The qualities of Portal 2 are rarely seen in a videogame. Compelling, lasting and smart: each and every minute of gameplay is filled with incredible content. If you love gaming, you can't miss this masterpiece."
2011,Portal 2,"Valve has worked its magic yet again with Portal 2, creating a mind-blowing game that's simply superb in both single-player and co-op. In other words, it's hole-ly essential."
2011,Portal 2,"Imaginative, challenging, hilarious and sometimes a bit exhausting, Portal 2 is one of 2011's most interesting, challenging blockbusters. Just make sure you take your sweet, sweet time with it - because you'll probably feel a hole in your head once it's done and dusted."
2011,Portal 2,"A huge and stunning sequel, as witty as it is brain-bendingly challenging. [July 2011, p.98]"
2011,Portal 2,"Really, don't miss Portal 2. Even if you've never played the first game, the sheer brilliance that has gone into this game's design shouldn't be missed. It's wonderfully fun and creative, while looking and sounding like a true sequel should. Don't be surprised if this one pops up on our best of 2011 list."
2011,Portal 2,"Portal 2 shows how a sequel has to be: longer, more varied and with a big plot. However there are several minor flaws: from the technical aspects to some lows of the single player campaign."
2011,Portal 2,"Indeed, this is both mathematical and storytelling art-work; it teams a gripping narrative with an inventive gameplay mechanic that makes for an excellent and unforgettable ride."
2011,Portal 2,"Portal 2 is an amazing puzzle game that, thanks to ingenious puzzles and an especially homourous story, keeps you gleud to your screen for hours on end. And you'll play it all with a big smile on your face."
2011,Portal 2,"Portal 2 is in the business of defying players' expectations. Valve never wants you to predict what's going to happen at any moment, and delights in subtly setting those pins up and knocking them down. Even more than the clever gameplay mechanics and sharply written story, the smiles and laughter that such a carefully crafted game can extract from you mean this one will stay with you for years to come."
2011,Portal 2,"The original Portal was a delicious dessert in the five-course meal that was The Orange Box. Portal 2 is a much more meaty affair altogether and incorporates humor, great puzzling and a wonderful co-op mode while still being true to the original."
2011,Portal 2,"Between real, actual co-op and Chell's adventure, Portal 2 provides a stupendous package. So stupendous, in fact, that I feel tremendously guilty admitting that somewhere, way deep down in whatever critics have in place of a heart, I kind of wish it didn't exist."
2011,Portal 2,"Portal 2 is more of the same, but only in the best of ways. Valve didn't mess with a winning formula, and the end result is that Portal 2 is a better game than its excellent predecessor."
2011,Portal 2,"Ultimately, Portal 2 is pure genius. With gameplay that never stops becoming addictive and new characters that always threaten to steal the spotlight, Portal 2 is one of the best games of 2011."
2011,Portal 2,"From gloriously glib opening to predictably musical finale, Portal 2 is a genuine delight and a game of rare quality. A well-judged sense of humour meets with some truly ingenious puzzle design to create a gaming experience that will linger long in the memory."
2011,Portal 2,"Just like its predecessor, this sequel manages to wring every last ounce of enjoyment out of seemingly simple core concepts. If you're strictly into action its slow, plodding, calculated pace will be a turnoff. Yet, somehow Valve has managed to make a puzzle game that will make your pulse rise with a never ending daisy chain of positive reinforcement."
2011,Portal 2,"Portal 2 builds upon the great gameplay of the first game, adding a compelling and humorous story and a great co-op campaign. If you played the first Portal, this game won't feel as fresh and innovative to you and the developers lowered the difficulty bar too; nonetheless, this is a very recommended game that every lover of logic puzzles should buy."
2011,Portal 2,"It could be argued that Portal didn't need a sequel, such a unique and complete experience as it was, but since it got one, it might as well be this; a game that stays true to the spirit of the original, while at the same time expanding and adding onto it, without over-complicating the experience. If this is how Valve chose to spend their time instead of developing Episode 3, we're not going to be the ones to complain!"
2011,Portal 2,"Your return to Aperture Science is a joyful one in this immensely appealing, laugh-out-loud funny, and thoroughly satisfying sequel."
2011,Portal 2,"By no means as revolutionary as the first game, but still lots and lots of fun. For some the overall playthrough time might be too short though, but Aperture is a place to visit again and again."
2011,Portal 2,"Even with its high praise, Portal 2 isn't perfect, but it's imaginative, it's sophisticated, and one of the best puzzlers we've played in years."
2011,Portal 2,"While it doesn't quite feel so new or exciting, the central premise is as brilliant as ever and Valve has enough tricks up their sleeves to keep it challenging, interesting, and hilarious as always."
2011,Portal 2,"The puzzles in Portal 2 are truly great, the co-op mode a welcome addition and the dialogues are sometimes hilarious. The constant ""enter a room, solve the puzzle, enter a new room"" formula does, however, get repetitive in the long run."
2011,Portal 2,"The best sequel we could have expected. The levels just plain aren't as challenging, but the new toys and characters manage to distract enough from the cracks in the paint to keep the whole ride breezing along. It astounds in some ways and disappoints in others, which, while not perfect, is good enough for science."
2011,Portal 2,"Emancipation complete for Portal, which gets rid of his ""bonus game"" condition with a second episode that is certainly no revolution but still manages to justify its new status."
2011,Uncharted 3,It's more than just the best entry in an outstanding series though - it epitomises the very reason many of us play video games. And that's its greatest achievement.
2011,Uncharted 3,"Viewed strictly as a videogame, Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception represents the height of technical achievement--the state-of-the-art, if you will--for the interactive console experience. [Holiday 2011, p.49]"
2011,Uncharted 3,"Uncharted 3 isn't quite as memorable as its predecessor, but that doesn't mean it isn't one of the best games to come out this year."
2011,Uncharted 3,With amazing graphics and groundbreaking gameplay Uncharted 3 earns its place among its predecessors and should rank highly with anyone who sits down to play it.
2011,Uncharted 3,Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception is not just a game but a true masterpiece in the gaming world which is a must have title for all owners of the PS3.
2011,Uncharted 3,"Even with some control and difficulty issues, Uncharted 3 tells a fantastic story and has graphics and gameplay to match. You can do no wrong in picking up Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception."
2011,Uncharted 3,"Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception is the perfect symphony of interactive, cinematic, action-adventure; a crowning achievement in game design so amazing I want to replay the entire series from the beginning. This is the adventure of a lifetime and definitely a contender for Game of the Year."
2011,Uncharted 3,"One of the most technically impressive adventures you can find, matched with a detailed and unique multiplayer, all while making it easy for a newcomer to pick up and enjoy. Drake's Deception is why most gamers play video games-experiences that keep us awed and engaged, and extra content to keep us coming back for more."
2011,Uncharted 3,"Despite this minor gripes, Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception is a masterpiece and a strong contender for game of the year. Like its predecessors, it pushes the boundaries of what's cinematically possible in the medium of video games, and is a thrill ride from start to finish."
2011,Uncharted 3,"Uncharted 3, perhaps for the first time, represents what we all hoped games would eventually evolve into. Its production values are sky-high, and it puts you at the centre of a gloriously rich and irresistible world, controlling a character who is heroic, but also convincingly human. It's also mildly didactic, and feels less dumbed-down than any mainstream movie we've come across in years."
2011,Uncharted 3,"Uncharted 3 jumps from one extraordinary set piece to the next, pushing the way a videogame narrative can be presented. Equal parts exhilarating and emotional, I can't say I have ever played a more perfectly paced game."
2011,Uncharted 3,All that can be remains to be said about Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception is that it both defies and defines everything a videogame is and should be. In that order.
2011,Uncharted 3,"The visuals are breathtaking, the story is fascinating and the gameplay is never-ending. Uncharted 3 is like a fast-paced locomotive that cannot be stopped. The expectations were high, but Naughty Dog met them and even added an action-oriented frantic multiplayer. This third title clearly honours its parents, but as a child it does tricks with its pulsing vigour."
2011,Uncharted 3,"An absolute masterpiece that deserves attention from any gamer out there. If you own a PS3 you can't miss it and if you don't... well, you should consider buying one just for Naughty Dog's latest product."
2011,Uncharted 3,"Uncharted 3 will make you laugh, stare and just watch the TV in shock and awe. There is no doubt about it, Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception is the best game of 2011 so far."
2011,Uncharted 3,"For the second time in succession, Naughty Dog has created a game that can claim to not only be the best on PS3, but also one of the best in gaming history...A visual, technical and narrative tour de force that takes the sky-high expectations of an entire community and blows them out the back of a jumbo jet, replacing them with more show-stopping moments than you could hope to find in a dozen other games combined. [Dec 2011]"
2011,Uncharted 3,"There's no question here: this isn't just the best Uncharted game Naughty Dog have made, it's probably the best PlayStation 3 game anyone has made ¡V and I'm not sure what other praise I can offer."
2011,Uncharted 3,"Uncharted 3 has but one shortcoming: it's where we wanted it to be. To an exhilarating solo adventure, even though it's less surprising and a tiny bit less well-paced than the second episode, add in a gorgeous multiplayer offer that's well-crafted and well thought-out. Drake and his friends take us on a marvelous journey once more, but the formula may have found its own limits with this third episode, at least on this generation of machines."
2011,Uncharted 3,"A stunningly constructed action game that puts the competition to shame. The quality comes not only from its individual elements, but from the seamless manner in which they're connected. Essential."
2011,Uncharted 3,"In some ways, it helps to think of Toy Story 3 or The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King when explaining Uncharted 3. Similar to this third game, both films are satisfying final acts that deliver entertaining and unique stories with respect to their previous installments."
2011,Uncharted 3,"The only thing that might surprise you about Uncharted 3's relentless roller coaster ride is that it doesn't advance the standards for video game action like its groundbreaking, mind-blowing, superlative-generating predecessor did. But it certainly does match them. There's a slight sense of ""been there, done that"" in the way this game hews so closely to Uncharted 2's masterful blend of puzzle-solving, parkour, and dizzying action scenes."
2011,Uncharted 3,"The entire Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception experience comes together and delivers an unforgettable adventure rich with cinematic eye-candy, intense action sequences, and a multiplayer component that convincingly entertains."
2011,Uncharted 3,"From start to finish, single player to multiplayer, this game sings. The characters, the graphics, the sound, the story ¡V they're all top notch. If you're willing to skip Uncharted 3, be prepared to miss one of gaming's finest moments."
2011,Uncharted 3,"Overall, the combination of a robust multiplayer, a surprisingly compelling co-op adventure, and a thrilling ten-hour single-player campaign add up to a title that is, quite simply, a must-own"
2011,Uncharted 3,Words almost can't describe a game that nears perfection. And that is exactly what Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception does.
2011,Uncharted 3,"The pacing, storytelling, drama, and comedy roll together to give one of the most remarkably cinematic experience in gaming today. Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception simply raises a bar that didn't even need to be raised. But now that it has, we will never want to go back."
2011,Uncharted 3,"Uncharted 3 is the very best in the series yet, a true jewel that keeps the player excited from start to finish. A visual masterpiece with a great direction and very compelling multiplayer experience. Definitely a must buy."
2011,Uncharted 3,"The single player campaign is one of the most memorable off-line gameplays that can be experienced now, and its multiplayer modes are very interesting too. Uncharted 3 is definitely the best reason to own a PlayStation 3."
2011,Uncharted 3,"Gamers who experienced Nate's extraordinary journey to find Shangri-La in 2009 should recognize the familiar gameplay, but still welcome this new adventure with open arms and a Sully-sized hug."
2011,Uncharted 3,"Confident storytelling, astonishing visuals and obscenely ambitious setpieces make Uncharted 3 the best of the series and an absolute must-have. [Dec 2011, p.90]"
2011,Uncharted 3,"The most solid game in the series and also a materpiece of storytelling, which raises again the bar of visual quality in consoles. It adds new elements to its gameplay to avoid aging, and provides a great multiplayer mode offering tons of options. A must-have for PS3 owners and one of the best games of the year."
2011,Uncharted 3,Uncharted 3 delivers a compelling story and backs it with some great gameplay.
2011,Uncharted 3,"For adventurers who prefer a stealthy approach, we have good news: the balance between shooting and taking enemies out with your fists is much better balanced this time round. Nearly every confrontation can be handled in various ways. [Nov 2011, p.58]"
2011,Uncharted 3,"Others have come close before (and Batman Arkham City is as close as it gets), but as one of the two or three best games of 2011, Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception defines what an interactive movie gaming adventure truly is and solidifies its place as the best PS3 franchise ever produced."
2011,Uncharted 3,"It's the reason you have a Playstation 3. This is the second best exclusive I have played this year, Resistance 3 being the other one."
2011,Uncharted 3,For fans of the series Uncharted 3 is a more than a competent and completely rewarding continuation of the Nathan Drake saga and worthy of a purchase this holiday season.
2011,Uncharted 3,"Uncharted 3 will undoubtedly be compared to its predecessor, for the two standalone leagues ahead of their genre. The sheer level of intensity, played out in the most cinematic blockbuster action packed scenes to grace a gaming platform, with a surprising level of variety and detail that resonates development passion, then there's a wealthy multiplayer on top too!"
2011,Uncharted 3,"Uncharted 3 sets the bar for adventure games, it's an epic journey that you'll want to relive over and over again."
2011,Uncharted 3,"Uncharted 3 is a must have title for every PS3 owner. Seriously, buy this game."
2011,Uncharted 3,"As all sequels (or three-quels) should, this third outing significantly raises the stakes and is by far the most personal."
2011,Uncharted 3,"Uncharted 2: Among Thieves is one of the best PS3 games around, no action-adventure could stand up to it by comparison ¡V until now! Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception combines the good elements of its predecessor with some new, fresh features like the enhanced multiplayer in a stunning setting. The atmosphere and the story really capture the player's interest and will have them lost track of time. A great game ¡V thanks, Naughty Dog."
2011,Uncharted 3,"If Uncharted 3 proves anything, it's that Naughty Dog may be the most versatile studio in videogames. Their ability to craft tightly paced cinematic action, lighthearted narratives, endearing characters, and paint it with technical wizardry is unparalleled. Every single aspect of Uncharted 3, including its surprisingly robust multiplayer, is staggeringly well-executed."
2011,Uncharted 3,"Around the edges of Uncharted 3, there's the vague sense that things are a bit too pat, that it's all beginning to feel a little formulaic. You could draw comparisons to Call of Duty, another series that relies heavily on high production values and popcorn-movie bombast. However, Uncharted 3 still affects me, not only because it's such sublime fun, but because it's telling the tale of characters I have a real affection for."
2011,Uncharted 3,"Its near-perfect sequence of peaks and valleys demonstrates how restraint can imbue some moments with increased impact. It's a short campaign, but the multiplayer makes it worth the asking price.. Drake's Deception is one of those games that has something for just about everyone, and if you own a PlayStation 3 it shouldn't be missed."
2011,Uncharted 3,"Uncharted 3 is one of the most incredible adventures you can ever live in a videogame. Storytelling, digital acting, tireless pace, and brilliant solutions to hide the linearity are there, as well as a dense multiplayer, to entertain any kind of gamer."
2011,Uncharted 3,"All of which makes this a big step on from Uncharted 2 in terms of visuals, gameplay and performance - but its biggest achievement is that, barring minor lapses, the threads are brought together into a superbly cohesive whole."
2011,Uncharted 3,"Uncharted 3 brings a unique adventure that you'll never forget. We love the Hollywood cinematics, we love the gameplay, we love the graphics. The game can be linear but the fantastic storyline and the spectacular cut scenes will keep you going until the credits appear."
2011,Uncharted 3,"Drake's Deception is driven -- like previous Uncharted games -- by the compelling and flawlessly executed story which is matched perfectly by the stunning visuals. Without doubt it's at the pinnacle of storytelling in video games. The puzzle solving is also a boon, intricate in detail with enough leeway to let you do all the thinking. It's a little disappointing then, that the shooting mechanics have the same shortcomings as Uncharted 2 and that it takes too long to get going."
2011,Uncharted 3,"Uncharted is still an incredible cinematic experience, but its own issues remain the same: limited interactivity, often too linear. Despite this, it's still one of the best adventure titles of the year, one you shouldn't miss. Multiplayer is just an add-on, but a very well crafted one."
2011,Uncharted 3,"The new Uncharted game offers one of the most entertaining adventures of all time. The animations, the characters and the story are well presented. You are going to feel like beeing the hero in a Hollywood movie. Also the puzzles of the game are brilliant. Some Uncharted fans will probably miss some innovations."
2011,Uncharted 3,"A great game that should have been superb. The experience is tainted by several gameplay mechanic problems that just shouldn't be there for this third game in the franchise this generation. Ultimately the good far outweighs the bad, but I can't escape the notion that I feel that the full potential of this sequel was not realized."
2011,Uncharted 3,"A well-written story, a thrill-ride, summer tent-pole film presentation, and a much more fleshed out multiplayer experience all add up to one of the best games we've seen this year. Naughty Dog has once again given PlayStation 3 owners a reason to fire up their console."
2011,Uncharted 3,"A polished visual treat, but quality competition means it isn't as outstanding as it once was. [Christmas 2011, p.62]"
2011,Uncharted 3,"Even with the plot issues the series has, Naughty Dog has done a tremendous job with Uncharted 3 and they should be proud of it. It's an excellent game, and definitely one of the highlights of 2011."
2011,Uncharted 3,"Uncharted 3 doesn't make any huge strides over its predecessor, and might not be as technically impressive as the leap from Uncharted to Uncharted 2 was. But it's more of what made Uncharted 2 so damn good, and it's hard to complain about that."
2011,Uncharted 3,"The characterisations by the actors is second to none and even though this tall-tale takes you to fantastical places and events, the script is never once unbelievable. You never feel like an outsider. If anything, you'll feel right at home, ensconced in the constant drama of this loveable cast of returning reprobates and reprehensible villains. [Dec 2011, p60]"
2011,Uncharted 3,Only a few camera troubles stopped us from giving Drake's Deception the highest rating. Uncharted 3 is without doubt the best PS3 exclusive game of this year. [Dec 2011]
2011,Uncharted 3,"At times you're left with the impression that Uncharted 3 could have been bolder ¡V the blueprint of success from Uncharted 2 has perhaps been adhered to a little too closely here. Beyond the slightly out-of-place gun combat and familiar box of tricks though, this third attempt is still a genuine innovator thanks mostly to an otherwise stagnant genre."
2011,Uncharted 3,"It's frustrating and deflating to have to admit it, but Drake's Deception isn't another defining experience on PS3. It's still fantastic fun in the most part and worth picking up, but overfamiliarity holds it back from true greatness. Sorry, Nate."
2011,Uncharted 3,"Drake's Deception takes its time to shape a story, and the result is a game that really comes together in the second half. When it does, it's really spectacular and questions that have been lingering in the background are answered in interesting ways. If the exciting singleplayer isn't enough content for your liking, the multiplayer offers a fun pastime."
2011,Uncharted 3,It's an amazing game with an engrossing singleplayer campaign and a complex multiplayer mode that allows for months of fun. But don't expect a massive quality leap from Uncharted 2.
2011,Uncharted 3,"I could ask for better in the manner in which Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception gets rolling, but once the ride hits full speed, it never disappointments."
2011,Uncharted 3,"A brilliant romp. The controls can be frustrating at times, but the overall journey is exceptional."
2011,Uncharted 3,"Uncharted 3 has the ability to elicit high excitement from its players through a tight and polished combination of gameplay styles, and through it's unmatched art direction. It's let down only slightly with a kind of shallowness, and a linear quality unbefitting a game of this quality. But these small niggles aside, Uncharted 3 will have players leaning forward through some of the best action sequences in gaming, and will be a favourite for both long time fans and those new to the series."
2011,Uncharted 3,"It's a close call between Among Thieves and Drake's Deception to the crown of best game in the franchise, however I think the unpredictable twists that are woven into the fantastic story let the newest episode reach a new pinnacle and I recommend everyone to play it."
2011,Uncharted 3,"Multiplayer, both competitive and co-operative, has been genuinely improved and provides an exciting alternative for PlayStation 3 owners. At the end of the day, for what it lacks in complexity, Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception makes up for it in spades in delivering thrill and adventure."
2011,Uncharted 3,"The third installation in the Uncharted series is bombastic and looks simply amazing. The highly scripted gameplay doesn't feel as fresh as it used to and the story loses its focus about halfway in, but a surprisingly good multiplayer experience saves the grade."
2011,Uncharted 3,"With Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception Naughy Dog delivers another great adventure that reaches the quality standards of Uncharted 3, even surpassing them at certain times. However, it was expected a longer longevity and a reinterpretation of the structure of the game."
2011,Uncharted 3,"This is a beautiful, cohesive, and, most importantly, fun adventure that cements the Uncharted franchise as one of the best around. More of a good thing is welcome here."
2011,Uncharted 3,"The campaign can be a bit disappointing, but with Naughty Dog still inanother league, and with a great co-op and multiplayer, Uncharted 3 is a game you shouldn't miss."
2011,Uncharted 3,"Uncharted 3 is the seal to one of the best franchises of this generation. Packed with intense action scenes, as usual, the script is the most exciting we've seen in the series so far. The superb graphics allow the game to show incredibly recreated locations such as the desert of Arabia. The multiplayer is much improved, becoming a real alternative to the main game. The only problem? Not as good and surprising as the second game, and a slow beginning."
2011,Uncharted 3,"Following on the best game of 2009, Uncharted 3 doesn't disappoint. The action is even more over the top, the close combat is improved and the acting is amazing. The controls are a bit too loose though, and Drake's platforming antics border on being a parody of itself, but apart from that this is a real gem."
2011,Uncharted 3,"Naughty Dog once again delivers a unique cinematic experience that has no equal. With superb graphics, unbelievable set-pieces, superb story telling and great characters, Uncharted 3 is a genre-defining game. Next time though, we'd like to see better shooting mechanics."
2011,Uncharted 3,"No longer just an imitation of cinematic blockbusters but an interactive roller-coaster of outstanding ambition, technical ability, and genuine heart."
2011,Uncharted 3,"I may have come down hard on the story, but that's because I hate to see potential unfulfilled. Uncharted 2 remains my favourite, simply because I value well-realised characters above anything else. But if you're less of a fussy bastard than me, and if you want a game that will wow you with sheer spectacle and keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish, then get this game."
2011,Uncharted 3,"Naughty Dog have rediscovered an art that seemed lost with those Hollywood adventures. Conjuring a Spielberg-esque bounce and flow, sweeping you along for the ride and, in Nathan Drake, offering a hero that's neither emo, arrogant or Shia LeBeouf. Just cocky, vulnerable and a bit handy at climbing around and kicking people in the head."
2011,Uncharted 3,"Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception's visuals are absolutely stunning, from beautiful and life-like surroundings to characters that look like they could walk into your livingroom any moment. And when Drake returns this time, developer Naughty Dog has perfected the balance between storytelling and gameplay. They've practically ticked all the boxes this time, and Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception may very well be one of the best games this year."
2011,Uncharted 3,"The present console cycle is expected to last nearly a decade, and there will inevitably be developers advocating the need for more sophisticated tools. But just like Machu Picchu, the Pyramids and every other engineering marvel of antiquity, Uncharted 3 will stand as a reminder to future generations of gamers that enough problem-solving imagination can turn any old trowel into a magic wand."
2011,Uncharted 3,"The puzzles are refreshingly taut, the design and scope bewildering and its conclusion a triumphant crescendo of storytelling. It's completely iterative, derivative and formulaic, holding few surprises during its eight-hour campaign, yet Naughty Dog twists these familiar tropes into an invigorating rush of agile gameplay and seamless cinematic spectacle, proving once again that Nathan Drake is without equal."
2011,Uncharted 3,"At its best when being guided by Naughty Dog's meticulous hand. It's a genuine adventure; strap yourself into the single-player campaign and it's a white-knuckle ride with some of gaming's most engaging characters. Uncharted 3's trivial flaws are buried beneath a tidal wave of big-budget spectacle, and a genuine narrative warmth far beyond most blockbuster titles."
2011,Uncharted 3,"While it never quite reaches the highs of Uncharted 2, Uncharted 3's slick, relentless action, beautiful visuals and beefed-up multiplayer ensure that it stands well enough on its own."
2011,Uncharted 3,"Moment to moment, it outshines just about every other game on the market, and while it doesn't exactly break the action-adventure mold, it fills it with such practiced substance that you don't really mind the familiarity of its shape."
2011,Uncharted 3,"Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception is a fantastic game that should get even better when the aiming and shooting is patched. It's an absolutely worthwhile experience for anyone who loves the series or simply enjoys a heart-pounding adventure. Unfortunately, the pacing, puzzle segments and platforming just aren't quite as good as those found Uncharted 2: Among Thieves."
2011,Uncharted 3,"Amazing visuals, solid gameplay and an enjoyable story - Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception has them all and then some. It's a great game that could have been a truly excellent one if not for some slight shortcomings (platforming and puzzles are too easy, too much shooting in the latter part of the game, last minute escapes start feeling old after a while...). Still, it's an experience not to be missed. [Nov 2011]"
2011,Uncharted 3,"Uncharted 3 shines in every artistic and technological aspect and offers one of the greatest adventures in the history of gaming. It would be a mistake not to embark on it. [December 2011, p.78]"
2011,Uncharted 3,"The execution is flawless as usual. Backgrounds, animation, lighting,music, sound, visual effects are breathtaking, well-directedcinematics are peppered with snarky dialogue. It's a bona-fideHollywood blockbuster."
2011,Uncharted 3,"Uncharted's third engagement into the uncharted leaves another lasting impression. Although slightly underachieving in its innovation, Drake's magnetic pull for trouble provides another memorable adventure."
2011,Uncharted 3,"Were Uncharted 3 any other game, if it didn't hit with dizzying highs to offset the abysmal lows, it would be infinitely skippable. Instead, compelling (but difficult) multiplayer and enough ""wow"" moments mean it's worth seeing, but not owning."
2011,Uncharted 3,"Despite its unquestionable quality however, the praise we can lavish on Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception is tempered slightly by a sense that the template might be reaching its breaking point and that even more treasure could be found with a little more diversity to accompany the astonishing moments of technical and cinematic wizardry."
2011,Uncharted 3,"Those thrills, ripped straight from summer blockbusters, tend to be both Uncharted 3's biggest strength and biggest flaw...Drake's Deception never lets up on the action, and it has an obsession with constantly one-upping itself. Before the end of the game, you will have escaped from a burning building, outran a massive wave of water aboard a sinking cruise ship and traversed a seemingly endless desert...These segments are thrilling, heart-racing stuff, but predictable."
2011,Uncharted 3,"The production values are incredible. This is truly an amazing game to look at. This time around the story feels a bit more like something you could get away with if it was a tv-series - too many loose ends and not something that fits a game release schedule. Drake is still great to look at, and the multiplayer is a blast. And you know more than anyone if that is enough for you."
2011,Uncharted 3,Quotation forthcoming.
2011,Uncharted 3,"It is a majestic tribute to cinema, a movie game in the literal sense, and your enjoyment will be in precise step with your appreciation of that objective - and whether or not you believe it to be Drake's great deception, or Drake's great delight."
2011,Uncharted 3,"Following the hyper-approachable formula used by Apple in the electronics industry, Naughty Dog has crafted another Uncharted game that a majority of players will feel is a welcoming and praiseworthy achievement. However, in comparison to many of its contemporaries, the gameplay ultimately feels stale and doesn't emphasize the more unique and rewarding qualities that separate video games from other media."
2011,Uncharted 3,"Uncharted 3 isn't a bad game, there's plenty of visual style and action to be seen, the characters are likeable, and there are a few puzzles that will make you think. The problem is that Uncharted 3 sometimes doesn't feel like a game at all, but a movie I'm watching play out without my participation."
2011,Uncharted 3,"Although the action in the final scenes is some of the best the title has to offer, the delivery of the narrative's closing stages is rushed and ultimately seems rather weak."
2011,Uncharted 3,"Two years after Thieves, Uncharted's gameplay mechanics and conventions are no longer dated; they're borderline archaic."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"Overall, this is the best experience I've had playing a Zelda game since Ocarina of Time and I'd have to say they are pretty equal in my opinion. Either way, you won't be disappointed getting this game, it's a masterpiece."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,Pure Nintendo magic.
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"To reiterate, no one takes advantage of Nintendo's hardware like they do themselves. It establishes a new direction for combat, and even justifies motion controls - something that's been a long time coming."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"Quoting Robin Williams in the most recent commercial of the game, Skyward Sword is the result of a project of 25 years and a clear confirmation that only the experience of a quarter of a century is able to turn a game into a legend."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"The Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword is a product that crosses boundaries and imagination itself, delivering everything the fans could wish for a game on a Nintendo Wii."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,What Nintendo has done to celebrate 25 years of the franchise is make one of the best games ever.
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"The beauty of The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword is that it extracts the key core elements that make the series so impressive in the first place and brings along a large does of familiarity, but then goes on to mix in a whole host of newly-styled dungeons, brand new puzzles that appeal to a broad audience, as well as superb 1:1 sword control that actually needs to be mastered for progression rather than being added as a gimmick or just for show and a twist on the normal storyline."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"The game is also huge. There isn't a staggering amount of terrain compared to other titles in the series, but Skyward Sword gets every last ounce of mileage out of each area. It takes a few hours just to complete each sub-section before reaching a new dungeon, followed by a few more for the dungeon itself. There's a strong 30¡V40 hour adventure here before even considering the multitude of sidequests you can take on."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,A master class in videogame design.
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"No, Skyward Sword isn't better than Ocarina Of Time. But of all the Zeldas to be released over the last 13 years, it comes closest. The game's greatest achievement is that it never stops aspiring to be more than it is. It never stops reaching for emotional moments, going full-tilt for players' hearts."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,An exhilarating journey in every sense. Skyloft is an area you'll want to explore and Skyward Sword is well worth the wait. Prepare to be amazed.
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,Skyward Sword will be remembered as one of the greatest chapters of the series. This is the type of game that Wii deserves. Brilliant!
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"With the Wii showing its age more than ever, Nintendo's strategy is to compensate with an immersive interface, mesmerising world and engaging story. It's an approach that pays off, proving that gameplay should be valued above all else."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"Every moment is a joy. As Skyward Sword progresses, each new area or item feels like The Legend of Zelda shedding some of the trappings of its past. It never veers too wildly from its time-honoured formula, but in every sense this is the freshest, most contemporary Zelda game in over a decade. An ingenious collaboration of design and motion control, the only shame is that it's taken the Wii so long to come to such fruition."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"A game of stunning creativity: the work of master craftsmen and women, it's a breathtaking technical achievement in many ways, with subtly beautiful visuals and audio blending with rampantly imaginative design. It's as good a Zelda game as we've ever played, and one that fully delivers on the revolution Nintendo promised back in 2005."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"Timeless masterpiece. This Legend of Zelda takes over from Ocarina of Time. It's a step in the saga and a revolution in the design of third-person adventures. The Wii MotionPlus works perfectly, so the game is especially fun. A gift from heaven!"
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,Skyward Sword manages to honor 25 years' of gaming history while simultaneously feeling relevant for anyone new to the ways of Zelda - or those who'd perhaps grown a bit tired of hanging out with Link.
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"Nintendo's most time- and workforce-intensive project yet, and it shows in every hour you spend with it. It's a masterful blend of taut design and boldly non-traditional controls, an adventure liberally studded with memorable moments it would be remiss to spoil. Your favourite Zelda is usually your first. For many, come November 18, that won't be the case any longer."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"It is the most formally inventive Zelda in a long time (admittedly, that's not saying a great deal). But it's the game's carefree attitude, quick tempo and warm heart that do the most to make it feel new...Skyward Sword will surely be the greatest adventure money can buy."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"The most important change is that most everything feels new. The fights against giant boss creatures at the end of each dungeon don't rely on old ideas. The classic characters are replaced, for the most part, with novel ones. If you already know what's going to happen, is that really capturing the spirit of the original Legend of Zelda, in which we all went in blind? Skyward Sword shows that ""a real Zelda game"" is about more than certain items or certain gameplay rituals, which in the end is more meaningful than adding better sword controls."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"Skyward Sword is an epic, the sort of epic you call out of work or school for a few days to complete. A focused playthrough will take you north of 30 hours, and if you try to 100% the game, there is a 50+ hour quest to go through. Throw in the second quest, dubbed Hero Mode, and there is a lot of game to play."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"Revolutionary on at least two counts, with the best motion controls ever seen in a video game and an inspired reinvention and improvement of the Zelda formula."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"Whether or not it's the best ever Zelda game is open to debate, but it's certainly up there. However, nobody could argue that it's anything less than a masterclass in the art of crafting video games."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"Remarkably, this Zelda game manages to reshape its control scheme, design sensibility and pacing all at once while still telling a brilliantly powerful story featuring some very memorable characters. Increasingly Nintendo refuses to compromise cinematic storytelling for gameplay, finding a balance that seems effortless."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"Skyward Sword finally brings satisfying swordplay, delivering on a promise made five years ago."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"The biggest surprise in Skyward Sword is the story. For all the different shapes it has taken, the plot of The Legend of Zelda has always been a fairly predictable affair that feels like an afterthought. Skyward Sword doesn't elevate the art of video game storytelling, but it is a major step up for the franchise, with clever writing, an interesting (if strange) new villain, and a wide cast of characters that would feel at home in one of Disney's better animated movies."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,How apt that this ultimate tale of hero-making should see Nintendo's hardware become the console it was always meant to be.
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"A huge departure for Zelda and a proper arrival for motion controls. Link's latest is rule-breaking, dream-weaving, tech-loving, heart-soaring stuff. [Dec 2011, p.45]"
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,It's easily the best game I've played in a long time and the benchmark by which future Zelda titles will be judged.
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"Skyward Sword is a masterpiece. It raises the bar for the legendary series and is memorable from start to finish. It's challenging, unpredictable, diverse, thrilling, and endearing. It is the Zelda game you've been waiting for."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"A huge departure for Zelda and a proper arrival for Wii's motion controls. Link's latest is rule-breaking, dream-weaving, tech-loving, heart-soaring stuff. If it Wii's last hurrah, they don't come more impassioned than this."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"Skyward Sword stands as an ode to a series that has endured all of recent gaming history. It marks the dizzying pinnacle of both the Zelda series and motion-controlled gaming itself. It's a huge accomplishment that, even by Nintendo's own record, stands out as one of their finest."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"You may hate motion control, but once this game clicks, it is genius. If you are a Zelda fan, you cannot miss this game. It is simply the best Wii game yet, and definitely up there as one of the best Zelda games I have played in years."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"A daring break from the norm for Zelda, but a spectacular, boundary-smashing success. [Christmas 2011, p.76]"
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"It's impossible to understand the Wii's existence without the launch of Skyward Sword. The last great game for Wii jutifies the creation of the wiimote and, without being the turning point that we would expect, it's definetely a triumphant comeback in the series."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"A magnificent homage for the 25th anniversary of one the biggest franchises in gaming, The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword provides a compelling gaming and artistic showcase for the indefatigable potential of the medium as a whole, and a reason to have gaming as a hobby."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,One of the best Zelda titles I have ever laid my hands on. Its right up there with Ocarina of Time in terms of how many new innovations it brings to the franchise while still holding its Dungeon focused Puzzle approach to the roots.
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"What matters is that it's truly worthy of being called ""epic."" [Dec 2011, p.82]"
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword shows that neither the series nor Nintendo has lost its touch. The innovative controls add to the gameplay and turn every fight into a challenge. Furthermore, the traditionally strong level design proves itself once again, with the superb music and visuals making this one of the greats of this year."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"The latest game in this legendary franchise offers an experience like no other. The majestic graphics along with the superb motion control design create the ideal ""swan song"" for the Wii."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"My new favorite 3D Zelda title, beating out Majora's Mask and Wind Waker by a substantial margin. It would be hard to go back to any of those games now. All of the gameplay innovations, emotionally involving moments, beautiful little details, and purely blissful experiences in this game have me completely and utterly spoiled."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"A must-have that demonstrates that Zelda is still in great form, and celebrates in the best possible way the 25th birthday of the series. As each Zelda game, it is outstanding. Not only one of the best games in Wii history, but also one of the best in the generation."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"Not only one of the best Zelda games, but one of the best games ever made. It will take you places you've never been and show you sights you've never seen, so ignoring it just because it's on the Wii would be a damn shame."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"I'm not sure where Nintendo wants to take the series next, but it's going to be awful tough to improve upon this. Beautiful, complex, heartfelt, and exciting all at once, this isn't just the kind of game that defines a franchise; it's the kind of game that defines a genre."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"When it comes to making games, nobody does it like Nintendo. Skyward Sword is the game that Wii was born to run. [Dec 2011]"
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"Skyward Sword is not only a fitting tribute to the long running series, but also a milestone in the life of the Nintendo Wii itself, as it finally delivers a game that shows the true power of the control system. Besides, it is fun and challenging to play in its own right. Very highly recommended."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"Skyward Sword may not be the big first step into a new era from what Ocarina of Time was, but it's a strong close to the first 25 years, making the most of the dated Wii. The controls aren't just good, they actually do their part in making the game appealing. The entertaining story offers some surpises ¡V Zelda not being a princess even risks offending purists! ¡V and by virtue of that really feels fresh. Yes, Skyward Sword is a good reason to dust off the old Wii one more time."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword is not only one of the best Wii games of the year, it's one of the best games to hit the system ever."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,The new Zelda for Wii is not the best adventure of the series. But it truly is a great game with a lot of fresh elements. The combat system with Wii MotionPlus works well. You also will enjoy the dungeons and bossfights.
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"Even lacking the power and the scope of Ocarina of Time, Skyward Sword is still a great Zelda game and an engrossing single player experience like a few others nowadays."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"It's excruciating, mostly because Skyward Sword is such a rare, utterly wonderful game. It fully deserves to be thought of as a modern classic and a masterpiece, and it's so good that even controller frustrations couldn't keep me from sinking a completely crazy amount of time into it."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"The moments where the odd discordant cadence make us yearn for times gone by come a little too often, even though it's by far the greatest testimony and most successful game to fulfil the promise of one-to-one motion control. It's an apt swan song for our little white console, but ultimately it's flown a little too close to the sun."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"Combat is certainly more difficult, but every fight you get into feels like an event. And the game does a great job of pacing out its enemy encounters so the player doesn't get battle fatigue."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"Stripped bare of accessories, its all-business approach will thrill some and frustrate others. Less whimsical and more weighty, it proves that clever level design and tight gameplay trump all, and perhaps most importantly, that motion gaming can truly be for everyone."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,New Zelda is the best game of whole series since the groundbreaking Ocarina of Time. It is a true masterpiece with uncompromising playability. [Christmas 2011]
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"The beautiful world, noticeable graphics and unique characters make Skyward Sword come to life. Thanks to Wii Motion Plus the game has precise control that pull you in the adventure even more. An experience that makes you forget the five years of waiting."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"You can easily overlook occasionally frustrating controls and early 2000s graphics when the adventure itself consistently motivates you to want more and more for all of the nearly 60 hours it takes to complete. Skyward Sword isn't perfect, but it absolutely is not a game that should be missed by fans of the series."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,Quotation forthcoming.
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"Not a game without its faults, but Skyward Sword is another great entry in the Legend of Zelda. From it's familiar gameplay and structure to it's unique use of the Wii Motion+ controller, this one is a sure fire hit."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,One of the best Zelda games ever and this years cosiest adventure.
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"Link is back in the best shape we've seen him in for years. The puzzles and challenges are brilliant, and the motion controls really shows you how to do something right. This 25 year old kid is still as relevant as ever."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"Skyward Sword is one of the best adventures of this generation, allthough not the best Zelda title. The new control system works well most of the time, but there issues with the camera and some repetition in the gameplay."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"Skyward Sword is different form the usual Zelda experience: there's no overworld, resulting in a hampered exploration. But the other aspects of the gameplay are nothing but great: level design shines in every single area of the game; the pace is engaging, the progression linear but always entertaining. Plus, the game has a strong identity, thanks to its characterization, impressive visuals and the extraordinary musical score. It's not the same Legend, but it's another masterpiece."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"A superb adventure game with tons of charm, intelligence and ¡V basically ¡V fun stuff to do. Skyward Sword is a game that's fallen from heaven, with only some minor bruises."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"A perfectly balanced mix of innovation and classic Zelda gameplay, Skyward Sword truly lives up to the Zelda legacy of excellence and offers the most variety of any Zelda game to date. Its swordplay and puzzles are some of the best in the series, and seeing Link and Zelda's first story chronologically is a treat for longtime fans."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"One thing's for sure: Skyward Sword will divide. Its numerous qualities, among which the changes of scenery, the ingeniousness of the puzzles, make it able to provide us with a quest rich with intense moments, but some imprecision and lengthy sections prevent it from becoming the new and reformed shiny prince the series needed. If the Wii MotionPlus gameplay enables the immersion to go a step further, it requires a rigorous play style and will spawn some frustrations when it sometimes (rarely) doesn't work perfectly well. A beautiful adventure remains, still, proud to be the hallmark of the 25th anniversary of Link, Zelda & co... but not sufficiently sparkling to eclipse the infinite magic of the Ocarina of Time and Link to the Past episodes."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"It is a game punctuated by near-constant moments of genuine exhiliration, dishing out a stream of physical and mental satisfaction which moves between taxing and rewarding the player with an almost flawless equipoise. It is, however, a stream that's tragically interrupted by the filler which has reared its ugly head in so many of the series' past iterations."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"Spellbinding, dramatic and absolutely epic in both the world it paints and the story it tells, Zelda: Skyward Sword is a hugely important event for the Wii, for Nintendo, and for anyone with even a passing love for the venerable series it celebrates."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"Ultimately, The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword is an excellent entry into the series, but its rough spots prevent it from achieving true brilliance. It's still a fantastic choice for any Wii gamer, and it deserves to be in your library."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"While the developers made a conscious effort to shake things up with new ideas and implementations, the game falls into a weird middle ground filled with genuine surprises, inessential carry-overs, and copy/paste quest structures. That said, I still believe this to be one of the more admirable chapters of the series, even if at times it feels the developers were unsure of which sacred cows to keep and which to sacrifice."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"Like any reimagining of a series, Skyward Sword doesn't get everything right in the first try. Despite everything it does well, there are still several kinks that need to be worked out. That said, it's still the most creative, bold, and arguably important Zelda title to be released in over ten years."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"Storywise The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword is a very important game that reveals and explains certain points in the series. And as a game it's great fun, but still two full heart containers from being completely fantastic."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,Quotation forthcoming.
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"Skyward Sword_ is absolutely packed with content. There's hardly any fluff to be found in the 35 hours or so it takes to complete the main quest, outside of the typically sluggish opening scenes. But I feel like Zelda should be going back to its roots and becoming less linear, rather than moreso. It's a curious decision, and I'm not sure it'll sit particularly well with longtime Zelda fans."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"Designer Shigeru Miyamoto once said ""the first 30 minutes of a game is the most important,"" and Skyward Sword fails to pass that test. It takes several hours before you're given any sense of real freedom, which is too bad, as the game manages to merge the sublime openness of the sea from Wind Waker (without the Triforce madness!) with the directed fun of most other games, as it's easy to just keep moving forward without much fuss. And by the time you start seeing what the designers really have in store for you..., you actually don't want it to stop, even if you're able to constantly, cynically predict when the game will ask you to find just One More Thing before it's all over."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"You will soon discover that during fights you can wave your Wii Remote randomly and still defeat most of the enemies. The problem is that apart from the new control system there is nothing fresh in Skyward Sword. [January 2012, p.75]"
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,The introduction of the antagonist Ghirahim and the relationship between Link and Zelda are excellently laid out and the story contains a few twists and turns you will never see coming. It makes the entire experience feel more worthwhile - especially after the bafflingly cliched beginning.
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"The formula is beginning to show its age. There just aren't enough new ideas to separate Skyward Sword from its predecessors, and the few additions come with mixed results. Even with many bright spots, Skyward Sword still feels like a nostalgic retread. Those yearning for something new will be disappointed, but anyone thirsty for another exciting adventure will find plenty to enjoy here."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"Skyward Sword is an old and repeatedly-repaired blade. At the sun it dazzles the eyes, but not so much to hide its flaws from the past. A new blade must be forged at last to let the blade fully radiate."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"Skyward Sword holds dear to a lot of things we love about the series, but quite frankly just doesn't do enough to move things forward, leaving us with a merely good game that should have been great."
2011,Zelda: Skyward Sword,"After finishing the game, I can say that The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword was not what I expected. I thought it would be a good (but not great) practitioner of the Zelda formula hampered by unnecessary motion controls, much like Twilight Princess was. Instead, I got a game that's cripplingly hamstrung by its controls and even falters when presenting the basic Zelda recipe."
