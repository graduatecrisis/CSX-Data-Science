Predictability and reason have no place on this journey¡Xbut the kid in all of us will surely take the helm, a smile on his face."
2017,Super Mario Odyssey,"Super Mario Odyssey is a bold re-introduction to 3D Mario and one that is flat-out mandatory in 2017. The game is not the challenging, rigorous exercise found in the series¡¦ past so much as a deep dive into abject fun originality. Placing creativity and wonder above all else, Super Mario Odyssey is Nintendo¡¦s equivalent of a Pixar movie: magical, creative, and captivating, no matter what age you are."
2017,Super Mario Odyssey,"Super Mario Odyssey embraces its heritage at every turn, and the payoff isn¡¦t merely a warm feeling of nostalgia at the fan service, but a reworking of the old with the new to produce something completely unique. Previous games have brief moments of wonder and charm, but they do not come close to the emotional gratification of Odyssey.

This is another Mario game that will be remembered for ages to come."

2017,Super Mario Odyssey,"Not only does Super Mario Odyssey celebrate the history of Mario over his 30 years with nostalgic treats, but it embodies the delight of discovery that comes with the openness of a sandbox Mario title, pushing it forward with Nintendo¡¦s creativity to think up thrilling platforming scenarios. Nintendo has delivered a superb game that wants to take players on a trip through its bizarre and wonderful landscapes without restrictions, something that has been absent for too long in modern platform games."
2017,Super Mario Odyssey,"This latest entry to Mario certainly helps prove that single player experiences still have a place in an industry where games as a service seems to be the norm. I managed complete the game in about 20-30 hours, a robust post-game will keep the me coming back for more. Coupled with Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild, it looks like Nintendo will need to clear some shelf space when end of the year awards are named by the gaming press. If you don¡¦t have a Switch, I¡¦d encourage you to get one immediately before the holiday rush begins. This is an experience you should not sit on."
2017,Super Mario Odyssey,"Simply put, Super Mario Odyssey is the best game of 2017, and one of the greatest games of all time. Nintendo is on a roll. Long live the King."
2017,Super Mario Odyssey,"In my eyes, Nintendo has created the Magnum Opus of 3D Sandbox Open-World Platforming with this game. From start to finish, this game oozes with fun, great gameplay, amazing worlds and vistas and absolutely phenomenal music. The fact you have to use motion controls in order to get the full use of Cappy is weird but that's the only bad thing I can say about this game. Nintendo is spoiling us this year."
2017,Super Mario Odyssey,"Mario has over thirty years of history behind him and yet Odyssey manages to mix those feelings of old titles with new ideas for a fresh take on a genre everyone is familiar with. Whether in it for a simple fun time or looking to play Odyssey to completion, there¡¦s tons to be enjoyed by every player that will keep pulling them back for more. Mario¡¦s trip across the world is one of pure, simple joy that simply shouldn¡¦t be missed.

2017,Super Mario Odyssey,"Each kingdom is absolutely packed with charm, clever objectives, gorgeous visuals, a stellar soundtrack, and a huge variety of ways to have fun. One moon would have me leaping across tiny platforms with pinpoint precision, and the next would have me cheering up a businessman by dressing like a clown. At no point did I feel like I was checking boxes just to up my completion percentage. Even now that I've collected every moon and purple coin in the game, I still want to play more of it. It¡¦s one of the most joyous and entertaining gaming experiences I¡¦ve had in a long time, and it stands tall among the all-time great Mario games."
2017,Super Mario Odyssey,"It's extraordinary, really, that after all this time a new Mario game can feel as fresh as any that preceded it. Cappy is a revelation, exploring Kingdoms is bliss, and Super Mario Odyssey is a masterpiece."
2017,Super Mario Odyssey,"While I may be far removed from the days spent playing Super Mario World as a kid, completing it for the umpteenth time and still finding new secrets with each playthrough, experiencing Super Mario Odyssey transported me back to that same sense of wonder I felt when I first discovered the Star World, or when I used my cape to accidentally stumble upon a secret key that opened up a brand new level. Nintendo has delivered everything I could want in a Mario game, before adding things that I didn't even know I wanted. The end result of their efforts is a true modern masterpiece."
2017,Super Mario Odyssey,"Super Mario Odyssey honors much of what makes other 3D Mario games great, plus it adds plenty of its own flavor to the Mario stew thanks to its capture mechanic.

Outside of a few instances where the camera took on a mind of its own, I can't think of a moment when I wasn't enjoying myself while journeying with Mario and Cappy."

From the spectacular Kingdoms and all of their hidden secrets to the minute nods to past ventures and friends, the entirety of this adventure is a joyride from beginning to end ¡V with countless hours that can be invested into the title long after the narrative has been completed. The formulaic changes have helped modernized a genre that has long been dormant, which is an immense feat in and of itself."
2017,Super Mario Odyssey,"New sidekick Cappy could have been just another annoying sidekick, but its inclusion only adds to the playfulness of Nintendo Switch¡¦s first Mario adventure."
2017,Super Mario Odyssey,"Mario¡¦s games have been around for almost as long as game consoles have been a thing, but thankfully, he¡¦s always evolving. We rarely get the same Mario twice. Super Mario Odyssey delivers on that ongoing promise of originality and innovation: It distills the venerable series¡¦ joyful, irreverent world and characters and best-in-class platforming action, and introduces a steady stream of new and unexpected mechanics. It¡¦s all spun together into a generational masterpiece."

The Nintendo Switch is fast becoming the hottest platform, crammed full of sublime quality gaming experiences like this fantastic new escapade."

Super Mario Odyssey sanctifies a 30-year-old series that still amazes us episode after episode."
2017,Super Mario Odyssey,"As someone who enjoys level-based Super Mario games more, I have to say that Odyssey blew me away. With the next Power Moon constantly within reach, the push forward is constant. Using Mario's expanded moveset, unique challenges are abound while trying to collect your next Power Moon. Even the lack of traditional power-ups doesn¡¦t hurt the experience at all, as the team of Mario and Cappy offers all sorts of wonderful new abilities. The journey of this odyssey took me to all sorts of amazing worlds that I already find myself missing. Now that I've seen every bit of it, I look back on my adventure with a great smile. It is an incredible experience that I felt extremely compelled to complete, simply because I didn't want it all to end. Only the best games pull that feeling out of me, and this one did just that. Super Mario Odyssey is my favorite game on Switch by a long shot."

2017,Super Mario Odyssey,"Super Mario Odyssey is the best game available on Nintendo Switch, and just might be my favorite game of the year. It isn¡¦t just a masterclass of level and sound design, it¡¦s a celebration of the Super Mario franchise, and one of helluva celebration to take part in."
2017,Super Mario Odyssey,"Super Mario Odyssey represents a shift in direction for Mario. For about a decade we had exceptional but tightly structured 3D series entries, but this new arrival's building blocks go back to Super Mario 64. It's a very modern take on 'sandbox Mario', however - Cappy and his abilities are key additions that freshen up the formula, and we have a sizeable and diverse set of lands to explore. Odyssey will, inevitably, now enter the discussions about the 'best' Mario games. This writer won't be crowning it as number one just yet, but it is nevertheless worthy of the discussion. Particularly in the second half and post-credits it takes on a life of its own, showcasing incredible design and development flair. It's also a wonderful showcase for the Switch, and could introduce a whole new audience to the wonders of Mario in three dimensions. For the veterans among us, it's yet another special release to remind us of why Mario is still gaming's number one."
2017,Super Mario Odyssey,"Not since Super Mario 64 has a Mario adventure had me this captivated, immersed or impressed. Super Mario Odyssey is Nintendo's finest Super Mario title yet, and easily the most impressive Nintendo Switch title available. With so much to see and do - long after you've dispatched Bowser - you'll be returning to the Odyssey for a long time. Essential for all Switch owners and worth buying a Switch for. It's that good. [Issue 9, Page 16]"
2017,Super Mario Odyssey,"The pleasure of Super Mario Odyssey comes in the constant promise of something new. It is, in many ways, the greatest digital holiday you will ever take. An idea that Nintendo is very much aware of with the ever expanding wardrobe of travelling outfits, detailed maps for each Kingdom laid out like travel brochures and souvenirs that you can buy up with stage-specific coins. The variety, invention and sheer generosity on each trip is bewildering, an affirmation that Nintendo in this kind of exuberant form are absolutely peerless. A trip to savour. And not a second wasted."
2017,Super Mario Odyssey,"Super Mario Odyssey is bursting at the seams with creativity, as Nintendo plays with new ideas while also paying homage to their long history. Cappy's abilities are a perfect compliment to Mario's own, and there's a wonderful silliness and humour to their adventure as they visit a string of contrasting kingdoms that just beg you to find the secrets hidden around every corner. Simply put, Super Mario Odyssey is a masterpiece."
2017,Super Mario Odyssey,"Nintendo has managed, not once, but twice now in 2017 to take one of their beloved franchises, give it a breath of fresh air while still retaining the core of what made the series great in the first time.

2017,Super Mario Odyssey,"It¡¦s impossible to pinpoint a fault in Super Mario Odyssey, which both elegantly and eloquently surprises and calls back to its storied history. It¡¦s a game full of surprises; one that plays with your expectations and supersedes them in almost every way. If you have a Switch (or are yet to get one), it¡¦s simply essential."
2017,Super Mario Odyssey,"I¡¦d usually count myself a completionist who¡¦s only goal is to earn every single achievement possible, but Super Mario Odyssey showed me that there¡¦s so much more to it than collecting things. Maybe I¡¦ll revisit the wonder of the Cascade Kingdom and ride a Tyrannosaurus Rex. I could even play fetch with a shiba inu amongst the sand dunes, or bust out Mario¡¦s infamous swimsuit and test my skills against an ornery octopus thirsty for revenge. The best part of getting to the game¡¦s ending is the fact that it¡¦s a journey of your own creation, and if you reflect on the game as a whole, it¡¦s really a linear quest that somehow feels more freeing than the largest open-world game."
2017,Super Mario Odyssey,"A mix of the nostalgic, the fantastical, and the wonderfully bizarre, Mario's latest adventure provides more than a dozen tantalizing playgrounds to explore. With hundreds of collectibles, Kingdoms full of delightful details, and secrets waiting around every corner, Super Mario Odyssey is bound to keep players exploring long after the credits roll."

2017,Super Mario Odyssey,"Quibbles aside, Super Mario Odyssey is an absolute delight, and another Switch release that will have Nintendo fans debating which 3D Mario game is the best of them all. I still hang my hat on Super Mario Galaxy as the pinnacle of the series, but Odyssey and its wealth of gameplay styles and moons make it a close second."
2017,Super Mario Odyssey,"Super Mario Odyssey isn¡¦t just the best platformer to come around in years, it¡¦s also one of the most essential releases of the year. Period. A showcase for Nintendo¡¦s development talent and Mario as an iconic character that can still deliver surprising and transformative experiences even after all these years.

2017,Super Mario Odyssey,"Super Mario Odyssey feels like a new glove that fits like an old glove, the new high point of a decades-long evolutionary process that is so smooth, so finely-tuned, that playing it nearly feels like an extension of yourself. It creeps up on you, the scale and design of it all, in a way that often doesn¡¦t dawn on you just how purely grand it is until you stop playing and reflect on your experience. In a year full to bursting of huge, great games, Super Mario Odyssey stands out by acknowledging what¡¦s cool and works about games today. It trims all the fat and doubles-down on not a gameplay loop, but a gameplay flow that feels effortless the whole way through.

2017,Super Mario Odyssey,"Super Mario Odyssey may not reinvent the Mario formula, but it is a supremely satisfying adventure with a plethora of content and a penchant for the zany. This is a must own for Switch owners and fans of platforming."
2017,Super Mario Odyssey,"More so than any pop game this year, Super Mario Odyssey sees virtual space as a land of elating possibilities."
2017,Super Mario Odyssey,"Super Mario Odyssey is a joyous romp through the past, present and future of Mario's extensive history. The game is incredibly fun and charming, with interesting riddles and challenges at almost every turn. A few things could've been done a lot better (looking at you, motion controls and Broodals), but this is still a must-play for gamers of all ages and sizes."
2017,Super Mario Odyssey,"Super Mario Odyssey is exactly what we all expected, a great 3D Mario game. It doesn¡¦t shake up the formula, but it nearly perfects it. This is the collect-a-thon platformer that people have been waiting for, a chance to bring the genre into the modern day gaming environment. All it took was a massive expansion of scope."
2017,Super Mario Odyssey,I can¡¦t think of another 2017 title that has given me as much pure delight as Mario Odyssey.
2017,Super Mario Odyssey,"Mario¡¦s big debut on the Switch is a joy to experience. Its beautifully realized worlds, excellent platforming, admiration for series¡¦ past and new gameplay mechanics make Super Mario Odyssey worthy of the portly plumber¡¦s legacy."
2017,Super Mario Odyssey,"With hundreds of Power Moons to collect, an entire wardrobe of outfits that span Mario¡¦s storied history, and no shortage of Easter eggs to uncover, Super Mario Odyssey is one of the most complete packages Nintendo has ever offered."
2017,Super Mario Odyssey,Super Mario Odyssey is an absolute delight that will remind you why you started playing games in the first place.
2017,Super Mario Odyssey,"An inspired and creative jump & run adventure with funny transformations and remarkably clever hidden secrets. Overall the story mode is a little bit too easy for experienced Mario players, but nonetheless this is a tremendous new start for Nintendo's iconic hero - even though overall I still prefer the spheres of Super Mario Galaxy and its cool planet mechanics."
2017,Super Mario Odyssey,"In the first appearance of Super Mario on Switch, Nintendo revives all its 3D games of the past in one unmissable title."
2017,Super Mario Odyssey,"I love Super Mario Odyssey, but it isn't flawless. The kingdoms are mostly open and varied, and they encourage fun exploration. However, the main story and beginning of the game are a bit of a letdown. The postgame is where experienced players will find the most enjoyment. This is not the best Mario title, but it pushes Mario in a new and refreshing direction, and it may even develop into a Switch evergreen. There are plenty of things that I'd like to see rectified in the inevitable sequel."
2017,Super Mario Odyssey,"We were expecting a tremendous Mario, but in the end, Super Mario Odyssey is not as glorious as it appears. If it has undeniable qualities with well-oiled gameplay mechanics, it also displays technical issues and inequalities in the worlds we visited. Plus, the costumes that we earn are only cosmetic bonuses and the adventure ends a little quickly. But don't panic, Super Mario Odyssey is still a good episode and we've had fun with it."
2017,Super Mario Odyssey,"Aside from those issues and a cooperative mode that seems to exist purely to give a spectator something to do, I had a great time with Odyssey. It doesn¡¦t feel like the massive leap forward that some of Mario¡¦s earlier 3D outings have been, but its polish and spirit make it another must-play in the ever-increasingly impressive Switch library. Leave it to Nintendo to deliver us some blissful escapism in a year when a lot of us really need it."
2017,Super Mario Odyssey,"Mario¡¦s first turn on the Switch is fun, but lacks the innovation and creativity of Nintendo¡¦s best."
2017,Super Mario Odyssey,"For now, as a Mario game that continues the Switch's moves to blur the line between the portable and the home-based console, Super Mario Odyssey is a beautiful, rewarding example of what Nintendo has in store for the system."
2017,Super Mario Odyssey,"Super Mario Odyssey introduces several new gameplay mechanics to a beloved series, and delivers a colorful adventure that oozes with fun and nostalgia. It looks, sounds and plays just as great as expected, but the collection of power moons can sometimes feel a bit like a chore."
2017,Super Mario Odyssey,"Though a really neat game, Super Mario Odyssey is an utterly underwhelming adventure for every long-term Super Mario fan in existence. Unless Cappy brainwashed you. In that case, you are a satisfied zombie customer now. No, seriously, only a zombie would find a healthy challenge in this pleasant but disappointingly easy Super Mario Walk-in-the-park. Sorry - Odyssey."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"Where it takes mechanics from others in the industry, it improves upon them; where it introduces new ones, you slap your forehead in amazement that it hasn¡¦t been done before. Breath of the Wild is development done right, and damn near the best game you¡¦ll play all year."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,Breath of the Wild is a masterpiece.
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is nothing short of a masterpiece. The changes made to this game make it both brand new and familiar. The world the game brings us to is vast, beautiful and breathtaking and the soundtrack and sound design are absolutely phenomenal. As a man who has interest in game design this game is a great lesson in how it's done, as a gamer this was a great game to play and as a long time fan of the series I was just so happy I got to play this game. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild was set to be a one of a kind experience and indeed it was."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"I was truly shocked by how good Breath of the Wild is. Nintendo decided to wade into the sandbox games genre dominated by western developers and the result is an open world which outrivals all Assassin¡¦s Creeds, Skyrims, The Witchers and Just Causes combined and offers unprecedented degree of interaction. Simply put, Breath of the Wild is the unbelievable new standard for open world games. [05/2017, p.56]"
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"There are no words to describe just how divine Breath of the Wild is. It¡¦s easy to pinpoint its mortal weaknesses, but impossible to number all the strengths, this game represents a new definition of perfection. A simple, outstanding reminder of how simple ideas can overcome modern desires through the power of sheer effort and love."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is one of those rare games. It's an Ocarina of Time-level game. It is a Super Mario Galaxy-level game. This is a game that we're going to be talking about for decades to come. [Issue #27 ¡V May/June 2017, p. 74]"
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"It¡¦s beautiful, emotional, full of surprises and nostalgia, and just flat-out enjoyable to play at every moment. While I have played open world titles before, Breath of the Wild gave me a new sense of control over how my adventure played out, offering me a steady flow of chosen objectives and paths to them without overwhelming me with unnecessary information or bogging me down in sidequests. Mechanically sound, aesthetically pleasing (often breathtaking), challenging but rewarding, Breath of the Wild is a joyous journey you won¡¦t want to put down, just so you can see what¡¦s on the other side of each new hill."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"Breath of the Wild is a stunning achievement in terms of gameplay, technical detail, and world building, making the overall experience just fantastic. The Zelda series is certainly no stranger to quality, producing high quality titles since the days of Link to the Past. Never, though, has there been a Zelda quite like this. The openness of its structure brings a breadth of adventure that the series hasn't seen in a long time. It is not only a fantastic game in its own right, but provides a base for the series to build on for years to come. This instance of Hyrule is a joy to explore, and no fan of adventures, or games in general, should miss out on this title."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"Zelda gets you in with a series of clever puzzles, interactivity and richness of the gaming world, catchy combat and great design. One of the best games of all time. [Issue#273]"
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"Breath of the Wild isn¡¦t just the best Zelda game ever crafted, it¡¦s one of the best games of all time...Hand over the crown, Ocarina of Time."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"If it¡¦s impossible to have a perfect game, then the game that earns a perfect score is the one that is as good as we have any right to expect. I expected a lot from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. And with its beauty, scope, innovation, sheer playability, and nearly constant sense of joy and wonder, it soared beyond those expectations with ease...So yes, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild receives a perfect score, only the third I¡¦ve given out here on Post Arcade. Now go play. It¡¦s almost unimaginable that you will be disappointed."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"It is a magical trip to a brave new world for the franchise. There are some issues and possibly a few flaws, but they are not capable of leaving even a smudge on the beautiful face of this masterpiece."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"Breath of the Wild is a marvel of design; it¡¦s a wonder of ingenuity, and it has completely changed the standard when it comes to open world game creation."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"The largest Zelda? No dispute. The finest launch title for a new console? So, it is. And isn_t it also the best Zelda? Yippee. And something more. Breath of the Wild is so far the best Zelda, which will be unforgettably written in the history of open-world games."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"The new Zelda game is so big and so full of everything that it's impossible to write about all of that in a traditional review. Breath of the Wild is a true system seller, probably the best starting game in the history of gaming. Nintendo is back and if only this quality of game design is maintained, Switch will become THE console. No question."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"Breath of the Wild breathes the fresh air that the series needed, and it's this renovated air that makes this game so phenomenal. It's that sense of freedom, of liberation, of emancipation that we want for our lives, to look at the clock and not feel tortured with routine. That's the feeling that Breath of the Wild brings to every gameplay. If you are a gamer (whatever company you cheer for), don't miss the opportunity to play this Legend of Zelda. Games like this don't pop up every day."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"One of the best Zelda games to date and it¡¦s also the perfect game for the Nintendo Switch due to its portability. It¡¦s a very well-crafted game with some wonderful gaming mechanics and nothing feels contrived or limited but rather, it creates a very engaging open-world experience and one that feels real on so many levels."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"Breath of the Wild is a phenomenal title in and of itself, but it¡¦s particularly special in that it embodies the vision for the series that Miyamoto and Aonuma have never been able to realize until now. It¡¦s a game three decades in the making, and it¡¦s no exaggeration to say that I¡¦ve been waiting my entire life for this. Breath of the Wild is, by any measure except nostalgia, the best Zelda game ever made, and considering how many unbeatable classics this series has already produced, that is a staggering accomplishment."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"It¡¦s by no means a perfect game, as no game can be. But its faults are simply overwhelmed by its positives, and they never detracted from the joy I felt with each passing hour. Indeed, it¡¦s the best Zelda game the company has ever made, and certainly one of its best games of all time. In this, it¡¦s more than just a game for the storied company: it¡¦s a statement that Nintendo continues to have some of the best game developers in the world, and its understanding of joy is second to none."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"Breath of the Wild doesn¡¦t feel like an experiment for the Zelda series, it feels like the realization of what Zelda always wanted to be. It easily stands toe-to-toe with the best open world games of the generation, and is a marvelous way to introduce a brand new system. Whether you¡¦re a Zelda fan or not, this is certainly an experience you should not miss out on."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"Breath of the Wild is a ""Legendary"" game and one of the absolute best in the long history of video games."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"There are already a ton of great games in 2017, with plenty more to come over the next nine months, but Zelda is a once-a-generation title that I think no one should miss out on. Fans of the series will be in love, those that never managed to get into it will be enthralled. This is the next evolution of the series, and quite possibly one of the best games I have ever played. Do not miss this game."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,A wonderful experience is what awaits the player in this piece of art. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a must-have and it represents a new era for the saga.
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is, without a doubt, a masterpiece. Its few minor faults do little to detract from one of the very best games ever made."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is easily a contender for the best game of all time. It's a mastercraft in both technical and game design, and one which we'll be talking about for many years to come."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild has taken over A Link to the Past as my favourite game in the entire Zelda series. Therefore, Breath of the Wild has become what I consider to be the greatest game I have ever played. It does not have the narrative depth of other games reviewed on this site, but it is the first open-world game since the original Legend of Zelda that successfully tells the player to take it at their own pace (without feeling like you should be doing something else)."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"Despite the stellar story and the absolutely fantastic visuals (aside from some framerate issues on the Switch), it¡¦s this world overflowing with life that will grab and hold your attention for hours upon hours of gaming. As much as this is a story-driven RPG, Breath of the Wild is about its world, a world so vast that you could spend hours upon hours traversing its lands (trust me, I did) before actually making tangible progress in the story...It¡¦s the Zelda game we¡¦ve all been waiting for."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of The Wild is not just the best game in the franchise, it¡¦s also manages to reinvent the open world genre. This will be remembered as a masterpiece for years to come."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"Many games have presented a ""go anywhere, do anything"" structure, but few have been filled with places, challenges and mysteries as intriguing and charming as Breath of the Wild. The massive land of Hyrule, from beautiful grassy plains and craggy mountains to marshy swamps and long-forgotten ruins, is rife with wildlife, monsters, villages and all manner of suspicious landmarks that tug constantly at your curiosity, and demand to be investigated."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"I¡¦ve honestly fallen head over heels in love with Breath of the Wild in a way I¡¦ve not fallen in love with an open world game before. While many of the singular elements I¡¦ve spoken about here may not sound terribly groundbreaking for the genre, the way they come together once you¡¦re a couple of hours deep is some of the best paced, polished and fun open world design I have ever experienced. The separate parts combine into something far exceeding their sum total."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"Breath of the Wild is still very much a traditional Zelda adventure at its heart. Smart puzzles, dungeon-dwelling bosses, charming characters, and imaginative storytelling are still on the agenda. In fact, thanks to inspired new powers spawned from the mysterious Sheika Slate, puzzle-filled Shrines, brilliantly crafted enemy encounters, and a beautiful world brimming with life, the game's more familiar beats are better than ever."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"This is the pinnacle of adventuring, Zelda style. It takes the core elements that fans know and love from Nintendo's long-standing series, and mixes it smoothly in with gorgeous open-world exploration of Xenoblade Chronicles, to craft something so breath-taking and absorbing that hours upon hours will pass by without notice, and barely any progress will have actually been made in the main story because there were so many other aspects to take in and play around with, as well as sub-missions that fit so naturally into the core quest. Nintendo has outdone itself with The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - absolutely sublime work."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"A titanic open world full of life and things to do, a robust combat system, the best story ever to grace the series, an unprecedented artistic direction, puzzles that will blow your mind...are only some of the elements that make The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild an authentic masterpiece that will leave a mark on this medium forever."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"It's one of the best video games I've ever played, and is sure to keep you busy for many hours, days and weeks, exploring this vast, beautiful, unexpected world."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is no mere Zelda game ¡X it is a return to form for the decades-old series, showing that Nintendo still very much understands how to handle their property. Breath of the Wild may not only be the best Zelda game ever produced, but it rivals Super Mario 64 and Halo: Combat Evolved for the best launch game ever shipped with any console. With no exception, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a masterclass in game design and creativity, unprecedented from even Nintendo."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"With Breath of the Wild, Nintendo has built a living, breathing world that you never want to leave. If you¡¦re a newcomer to the series, a longtime fan or just want to see what all the hype is about, you won¡¦t be disappointed."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"The characters are amazing, the world is gorgeous, the enemies make you become a better fighter, and the shrines and dungeons constantly force you to pay attention to your surroundings and think. It is an absolutely extraordinary game, one that is a fitting end to the Wii U and glorious beginning for the Switch."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"Breath of the Wild¡¦s only tangible constraint is how creative the player can be at any given moment. The game is genuinely challenging, with secrets and rewards to be found around every corner. As you play, the staggering amount of ways in which you can interact with Hyrule naturally reveal themselves. There is always something new to discover, but at your own pace. Somehow, the adventure never loses momentum over dozens of hours of exploration, the inspired design holds up, making for an unmistakable Zelda game that completely changes everything expected from the series. After spending so much time with Breath of the Wild, it is already hard to imagine going back to the antiquated presentation of the past."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"If there¡¦s a better game out there than Breath of the Wild, I haven¡¦t played it. Nintendo has created, for me, the greatest game of all time. It¡¦s everything I want from a game and one of the most rewarding experiences I¡¦ve ever had."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"I think the result of all of its interlocking systems is a game that wants to slam you with moments of epiphanies. For me, my experience with Link¡¦s Awakening was about getting that one major flash of insight and then using that to understand the rest of the game and then the rest of the Zelda series. For Breath of the Wild, Nintendo made a game that could replicate that moment over and over."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is Nintendo firing on all cylinders. It's not just the best Zelda game yet, it's quite possibly the best game Nintendo has ever produced and is nothing short of a masterpiece."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"Having played numerous RPGs over many years, it¡¦s tough to think of one that is as spellbinding and so moreish as this. A modern day marvel on the Nintendo Switch, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is simply stunning."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"It is dense yet lean; its maps bursting with distraction but without an inch of it wasted. It is classical yet modern; drawing on the heritage of its own illustrious series while openly embracing more recent gaming trends. It is challenging yet welcoming; giving you the choice to ease yourself in or take on some of the game¡¦s most fearsome creatures...These are just some of the reasons why, after several dozen hours of play and despite not yet seeing its quest to completion, I am convinced that it is one of the very finest video games ever made."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"In reinvigorating the Zelda series, Nintendo has rediscovered what gave it life all those years ago, capturing a spirit of adventure that flows through Breath of the Wild like the breeze on Hyrule's fields. Link and Princess Zelda's battle to save Hyrule and vanquish evil has rarely felt like such a personal journey, thanks to a masterful game defined by its peerless, charming and truly beautiful setting. A masterpiece."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is Nintendo¡¦s Magnum Opus. It¡¦s not only the best Zelda game ever created, it¡¦s also one of the very best videogames in the history of the art. Games like this are so rare that it would be impossible to classify it as anything other than a masterpiece. Experience it at all costs."

2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,A masterpiece of design that shows Nintendo at the top of his game and shows an incredible lesson in creating a open world game in all its meanings.
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild isn¡¦t just good, it¡¦s the best launch title I¡¦ve ever played. It will single-handedly validate the purchase of the Switch for many people, and given the device's $299 price tag that's a huge accomplishment."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"Breath of the Wild draws from many sources of inspiration, including older Zelda games and titles like Skyrim and The Witcher 3, to create something wholly unique. Nintendo has crafted a wide, beautiful world to explore, underpinned with some interesting emergent mechanics. Breath of the Wild stands as one of the best in the series and a great opener for Nintendo's newest console."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"Breath of the Wild isn¡¦t just for longstanding Zelda fans, it¡¦s the pinnacle of an open-world experience that will appeal to anyone looking for a great game. An overall lack of voiced dialogue and an initially tricky menu layout are easy to come to terms with and overlook when compared to the sheer scale and fun found in Breath of the Wild. Anyone wondering how it stacks up, it¡¦s important to note that this could very well be the best Zelda has ever been, and it provides gamers of all walks with a Hyrule that¡¦s more than worth saving."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"I¡¦ve mentioned Ocarina of Time a few times, and there¡¦s a reason ¡V it is the benchmark by which all other Zelda games are tested. Somehow, and beyond all of my expectations, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild exceeds that mark. I can confidently declare that Breath of the Wild is the best Zelda game ever made."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"This sense of wonder is something that I haven¡¦t felt so strongly since I played A Link to the Past when I was seven years old. Ocarina of Time was able to capture some of that same magic in my teenage years. Now that I¡¦m in my thirties, I don¡¦t think that I expected it to be possible for a game to make me feel like that again."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"A game that marries the best bits of the franchise¡¦s long history with the best bits of the rest of the gaming world, and produces something even greater than the sum of its parts."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"I was entranced by this version of Hyrule, and it surprised me at nearly every turn, from its wealth of discoveries to the way it shuns the established tropes of previous Zelda games. It represents a profound new direction for one of gaming¡¦s best franchises and a new high point for open-world interactive experiences."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"I guess, in the end, it¡¦s not just that Breath of the Wild signals that Zelda has finally evolved and moved beyond the structure it¡¦s leaned on for so long. It¡¦s that the evolution in question has required Nintendo to finally treat its audience like intelligent people. That newfound respect has led to something big, and different, and exciting. But in an open world full of big changes, Breath of the Wild also almost always feels like a Zelda game ¡X and establishes itself as the first current, vital-feeling Zelda in almost 20 years."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"The most freeform Zelda yet, without sacrificing the charm, fun or quality you expect from the series. Nintendo¡¦s finest work since Super Mario Galaxy."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"This is the most special game Nintendo has made in years - especially for the core game playing audience. It's certainly the most important, interesting and exciting Zelda since OoT and LttP. It is a new all-time classic."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a landmark release for its franchise and Nintendo. It's the first time that Nintendo has truly taken on the open-world genre in a current-generation sense; in arriving late to the party, though, it embraces some strengths from top-of-the-class games while also forging its own identity. This game is a revolution for the franchise, but the Legend of Zelda essence is still there - its soul remains. The end result, then, is a captivating experience. This will be in the running as the best game in the IP's history, and it will likely be discussed as a leading contender in the broader open-world genre. Nintendo has bravely taken one of its biggest franchises in a new direction, and it's delivered a triumph."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"Breath of the Wild writes a new chapter in the videogames industry. Nintendo jumps to the open world scenario with passion to renew all the things we know about Zelda. It's a new dawn for the franchise, but also a work of heart, recovering the basis of the series from NES. The world of Hyrule is just a dream come true, and the game is unforgettable. It's a legend."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a monument of a game, a dense, rich, enveloping and challenging adventure that puts the players on the mercy of their wits from the very beginning and introduces survival variables and item management as something to take very seriously throughout the entire quest. Bringing much needed innovations while remaining fully loyal to the Zelda series, Breath of the Wild is a masterpiece and a dream come true that has undoubtedly earned its place among the greatest games ever made."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"Breath of the Wlid offers the same great feeling of scale and adventure as the first Zelda-games. This game throws you in at the deep end, and you get a great sense of freedom in return. The new version of Hyrule is to die for."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"Breath of the Wild is a defining moment for The Legend of Zelda series, and the most impressive game Nintendo has ever delivered."

2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a masterclass in open-world design and a watershed game that reinvents a 30-year-old franchise. It presents a wonderful sandbox full of mystery, dangling dozens upon dozens of tantalizing things in front of you that just beg to be explored. I¡¦ve had so many adventures in Breath of the Wild, and each one has a unique story behind what led me to them, making them stories on top of stories. And even after I¡¦ve spent more than 50 hours searching the far reaches of Hyrule, I still manage to come across things I haven¡¦t seen before. I¡¦ll easily spend 50 to 100 more trying to track down its fascinating moments."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"The best Zelda there¡¦s ever been, and very possibly the best video game ever made."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"Breath of the Wild is The Legend of Zelda game I didn¡¦t know I always wanted until I starting playing. It¡¦s a disservice to simply label it spectacular, and ¡§must buy¡¨ as a Switch launch title is merely a formality. Nintendo promised a lot and left us hanging delay after delay, culminating in a cross-gen switch, but it¡¦s delivered in every sense of the word. Breath of the Wild is the best in a series that¡¦s almost never disappointed."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"It's like nothing else Nintendo has made, an experience so simultaneously prodigious and accomplished that it feels like a mind-blowing mic drop to the sort of ""open world"" games (Grand Theft Auto V, The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim, The Witcher 3) the industry seems bent on proliferating."

2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"The result, for all the longevity of its series and the familiarity of the open-world genre, is a game that evokes feelings we haven¡¦t known for 20 years. Not since Ocarina Of Time have we set foot in a world that seems so mind-bogglingly vast, that feels so unerringly magical, that proves so relentlessly intriguing. Plenty of games promise to let us go anywhere and do anything; few, if any, ever deliver on it so irresistibly. Nineteen years on, Ocarina is still held up as the high-water mark of one of gaming¡¦s best-loved ¡V and greatest ¡V series. Now it may have to settle for second place. [April 2017, p.104]"
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"The experience is so phenomenal, it deserves to be in the conversation about the best Zelda game of all-time, if not the best games of all-time. When I say Breath of the Wild is a must-play title, it¡¦s not hyperbole, you simply must play this game."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"Breath of the Wild is without a doubt one of the best and most complex game in Nintendo¡¦s history.

It's easily among the most enjoyable sandbox games."

This is an amazing, standout entry in a series with a history dotted with masterpieces. It absolutely reinvents the Zelda style while still staying true to what makes past games work so well. This is a hell of a way to kick off a new console (or close one out if you play it on Wii U), as Breath of the Wild is one of the most impressive games I¡¦ve played in years."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild has forever changed the franchise ¡V a feat accomplished by looking to the past. Nintendo have captured the sense of wonder, danger, and awe that they created in 1986, and embedded it in a vast, enthralling world."

2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"For any gamer that views Ocarina of Time as the highlight of the franchise, Breath of the Wild is a very pleasant surprise. The innovations Nintendo offers are -nearly all- amazing and Hyrule is more appealing and grandiose than ever before."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"This is the best Legend of Zelda since Ocarina of Time. While Nintendo might not be the ingenious pioneer of the 80s and 90s, they prove, that they are willing to evolve and are still able to set a creative mark. With its towers, the loot and the collecting appeal it can¡¦t deny its ingratiation to the zeitgeist, but most of the time Nintendo does it better and more subtle than the competition."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"Breath Of The Wild delivers a huge world, and one that is interesting to explore even when such escapades prove fruitless. It comes good with satisfying combat and dozens of reasons to carry on playing after the credits. For all of its issues, it¡¦s a game that manages to reinvent itself, comfortably, effortlessly, in a space dominated by the industry¡¦s triple-A heavyweights. This is one of the most creative and engrossing open-world games in quite some time."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"However you characterize it -- rebirth, change of direction, or coming of age -- The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is the most mature game in the series' long history. It is a difficult game from a combat and survival perspective, and a challenging game in the amount of information that players have been trusted to figure out for themselves. Compared to its amazingly interactive and constantly surprising world, Breath of the Wild's relatively rote story and sometimes frustrating controls add a note of disappointment to an otherwise peak gaming experience."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"Whether new to the series or a long time veteran, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is the perfect balance of challenge, adventure and fun that shouldn¡¦t be missed out on."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"There is almost nothing without purpose in Breath of the Wild¡¦s world and it is easy to get lost for hours on end without ever advancing the story. Even so, it helps that the narrative holds up as well, providing another meaningful journey for the Hylian hero and heroine. Breath of the Wild is by no means perfect, but when you¡¦ve got a game that rewards every kind of exploration with a new wrinkle, it might not have to be."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"What Nintendo has created is an all-encompassing mind-body possession in which you find yourself inside something unusually, hauntingly engrossing."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"You know when you were a kid, in the summer, you used to have huge pretend adventures in the back garden with all your mates? Where the shed was a castle and the hedge was a jungle? And it was like really having an adventure? This is sort of like that."

2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a game that is meant to be loved and savored for years to come, and I'm sure it will be looked back on with as much fanfare and admiration as The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and Nintendo's other hallmark titles."

2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"Nintendo has achieved something really special with Breath of the Wild. All that¡¦s holding it back are the glaring framerate issues, but even that¡¦s not enough to dim the greatness that shines through. After trying for nearly a decade, the Zelda team has finally made a radical departure from the established Zelda formula. This is a bold new direction for the series, one that so perfectly embraces the spirit of the original NES adventure and re-imagines it for a new generation. Rather than striving to outdo Ocarina of Time, Nintendo has given us something entirely different, yet its impact is just as profound. Breath of the Wild is a landmark game that¡¦s hopefully just the start of an amazing future for Link¡¦s continuing adventures."

2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"Breath of the Wild is a landmark achievement for both the Zelda franchise and Nintendo as a whole. It's a brave new step into uncharted territory that continues to offer surprises and challenges long into its massive running time. I can't overstate how great it is to see the Big N taking risks again ¡X though the vast majority of them do pay off, I have to admit I felt a good deal of affection even when the chances they took fell flat."

2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"At its absolute best, Breath of the Wild offers some of the most absorbing experiences a Zelda game ever has. Unfortunately, it makes you work harder for it than you should, buried as it is under a pile of small but constant irritations that collaborate to form a thick crust of frustration around a delectable center. Breath of the Wild is a delightful adventure, one that tries its utmost to be as big a pain in the arse as possible."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild surprises with its gorgeous visual effects, spectacular horizons and the vast freedom given to players. Sadly, the open world is often empty and soulless, lacking a proper soundtrack, characters or stories that make for a truly unique experience."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,The audiovisual beauty alone of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is liable to convince you that more is indeed better.
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"Horizon Zero Dawn is a perfect proof, that if you give developers creative freedom and time, it will get you a sweet reward. For fans of action adventures and wonderful worlds Horizon is the obvious choice. [Issue#272]"
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"A stunningly good start to what will surely become a treasured PlayStation series. Brilliant stuff. [April 2017, p.71]"
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"Horizon Zero Dawn is as close to a flawless RPG as one could hope for; developer Guerilla Games went for the gold in every respect, and it shows. The game boasts immense production values in its gorgeous art direction, and is stuffed to the gills with great voiceover performances, atmospheric and tuneful music, and visceral sound effects work. Even more importantly, it provides a top-notch story that delights in plunging the unsuspecting player headfirst down a rabbit hole of epic proportions, far and away its strongest achievement."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"Amsterdam-based studio Guerilla Games, best known for PlayStation¡¦s grim but visually impressive Killzone franchise, spent more than six years on Horizon Zero Dawn, and it shows: in the beauty of the game¡¦s visuals, the depth of its backstory and the tightness of its design. Hopefully this isn¡¦t the last we¡¦ll see of this high-tech savage land. (Horizon Forbidden West, maybe? Please?)"
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"This game is, above all else, a narrative triumph: a nuanced hero's journey that blends tried-and-tested tribal fantasy tropes to a particularly poignant and humanistic brand of post-apocalyptic sci-fi."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"If you own a PlayStation 4 or are thinking about getting one in the near future there¡¦s not many excuses to not pick up Horizon: Zero Dawn. The five years of time and effort that Guerrilla Games poured into the title is evident, and it¡¦s certainly one of the best open world action RPG experiences in recent memory."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"An absolutely fantastic game. It¡¦s very polished, and comes with a compelling story, relatable characters, an absolutely fascinating setting, and top-notch gameplay. On top of that, its visuals will make you wonder if Santa secretly sneaked into your room to replace your PS4 with a gaming PC while you were asleep. It simply looks that good."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"Horizon: Zero Dawn is familiar but also really refreshing. It's not a short game (I spent around 30 hours with it), but the storytelling still feels concise and efficient. The combat has some nice options that make encounters fun, even when you're just stacking up stealth kills from the relative safety of a bush. And the presentation end of the game holds up its end of things with a solid soundtrack, great voice acting, and a cohesive design that makes all its disparate parts fit together. All in all, it's a great game, it's Guerrilla's strongest release to date."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"Its magical world is a wonder to explore, it controls and looks exceptional, and the unique, modular build of its enemies ensures that combat never gets old. Yes, items could have been more accessible, and I was left with more questions than answers by the end, but these were mere speed bumps in the bigger picture. Horizon Zero Dawn is the PS4¡¦s first major exclusive of 2017, and it couldn¡¦t have gotten much better."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"On the surface, Horizon seems like a jumble of influences but, just like the murderous machina wandering its lands, the game is far more than its component parts, delivering a gripping story, satisfying combat, and the most gorgeous video game environments I¡¦ve ever seen. Horizon confidently carves out an identity of its own in an overpopulated genre."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"Horizon Zero Dawn is an early contender for game of the year. Guerrilla Games has outdone themselves, in astounding fashion. This is a glorious game, the result of a team of masterful artisans who not only had a story that they wished to tell, but a world that was living inside of them which they wanted to share with us all. Now, we get to play inside their creation, and it is a breathtaking experience to behold. A massive, open world filled with equally massive, terrifying robots, juxtaposed against the beauty of the Earth, nature fighting back the darkness as it tends to do. Horizon Zero Dawn is the kind of game you play to get lost in, and can be enjoyed by players of all types. This could be the beginning of a stellar franchise, and there is something for everyone here. If you own a PS4, you owe it to yourself to give Horizon Zero Dawn a go."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"Horizon Zero Dawn is a sweeping epic, magically dancing across the lines between sci-fi and fantasy, masterfully intertwining two genres that traditionally have held their own space in gaming. It is Guerrilla Games' crowning achievement in video game development. Words cannot do justice for what you need to see for yourself."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"I got on the hype train early for this one, and I must say that Guerrilla Games delivers a nearly flawless gem of a game. Horizon: Zero Dawn is an exceptional title from start to finish and is an absolute must for any gamer, old or new."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"The gameplay design here has the best of everything with the minimum amount of flaws. You get a great back-end system with an easy front end that provides an entirely new view on how much fun a bow and arrow led game could be. In addition to the gameplay design details, there¡¦s also so much to explore and so much to do with the gameplay design put together in HZD. All of it is fun, addictive and makes you wish it wouldn¡¦t end."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"Horizon Zero Dawn is Guerrilla Games¡¦ best effort, one of the PS4¡¦s greatest games, and the best game ever crafted from the ground up for the platform. It combines a gripping narrative with intense action that blends both fast-paced combat with slower-paced, tense stealth sections perfectly. Everything about their vision for this game clicks into place and is accentuated by a stellar presentation. The game features top-shelf graphical work, a unique and enjoyable soundtrack, alongside a fantastic cast to make an unforgettable experience."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"Heading out into the world of Horizon Zero Dawn to take down these massive machines is an exhilarating feeling, which combines well with a story that gradually unfurls and engages its audience."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"By looking at this game alone, you would've never imagined Guerilla Games' previous works were on FPS games. Horizon: Zero Dawn reaches perfection in almost all of its aspects and it does so with relative ease. Aloy is an amazing character, a true bad-ass with a great story behind her, and the world she lives in is vast and full of interesting and unique characters and secrets. The combat, while a tad lacking, is extremely fun and addictive and the graphics are some of the best seen on the system with breath-taking vistas. If you happen to own a PS4, you should buy this game. If you don't, then you might want a PS4 for this one. Guerilla Games went and set the bar high for future open world games with this one."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"Guerilla Games has set the bar while it ventures into a new genre. The game looks phenomenal, and it offers variety, tens of hours of fun and an accessible system. It challenges you in every fight to play intelligently. This may be the best game of 2017."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"There¡¦s been much hype surrounding Horizon Zero Dawn and thankfully it has delivered in more ways than one. It boasts a very likeable and interesting protagonist and the story behind Horizon Zero Dawn is one that is filled with mystery and intrigue. Of course, it¡¦s all about the gameplay and Guerrilla should be commended in creating such a fluid and dynamic game as you explore this post-apocalyptic world 1000 years in the future that is filled with different cultures and even history which seems so real. Combat is fun and the missions are diverse and at the end of the day, Horizon Zero Dawn is a title that really raises the benchmark on the PlayStation 4."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"While the main storyline was lacking, there's a reason good world-building is critical to good fantasy, and like I said, this game nails it. I loved about the game was the way it used Aloy's Focus to force you to examine things. Each new area becomes a crime scene as Aloy examines and analyses what's been left behind. It's a clever way to blend the idea of technology into this otherwise primitive world."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"Horizon Zero Dawn has an unforgettable protagonist, world, story, visuals, soundtrack and gameplay. Due to minor issues with inventory management and quest selection, I cannot call it perfect but I can say it is absolutely worth your time."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"PS4's best exclusive, and an exhilarating new IP that spits at sequelitis. An instant open-world classic. [April 2017, p.74]"
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"Horizon Zero Dawn is a pure sign of what can be completed with an exceptionally designed open world. Not only that, it has exceptional characterisation and a sincere story that doesn't shoehorn elements, allowing for the organic growth of characters. This is a game that I can barely find any faults with, except borrowing some elements from other open world games. Even so, it made each and every element its own in one of the best games to date."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"It¡¦s an open world game that kept me engaged and enthralled from start to finish, featured a simplified and polished variant on a combat loop I love, and felt made with a passion and sincerity rare in AAA video games. Horizon: Zero Dawn is right now my favourite game on the PlayStation 4 by quite a long way. It truly is worth of praise."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"A great story, outstanding visuals and very enjoyable gameplay. Brilliant in every single way. Guerrilla once more cements its reputation as one of PlayStation's very best developers."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"Horizon Zero Dawn is compelling from the first minutes of the game, telling an incredible story and marking it with a deep crafting system and exceptional combat. Aloy is inspiring in her lead role, with the potential to become a new leading face in gaming for a long time to come."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"Horizon: Zero Dawn is Guerrilla's biggest game to date, and not just from a technical standpoint. It's also one hell of an action RPG, thanks to a complex and satisfying combat system. The story and universe are also huge; Aloy's future is already shining on the horizon. A star is born."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"It's not often that a game of this caliber lives up to all expectations. Horizon Zero Dawn starts slowly, but transforms in a huge action adventure. We haven't been obsessed with a virtual world to this degree since The Witcher 3. Horizon impresses in every facet imaginable."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"Horizon Zero Dawn thrums with the energy of a creative team finally allowed to explore something new. It builds on elements of open-world and loot-and-craft gameplay that we've seen before, but it does so within a context, a setting and a style that feel fresh. Horizon Zero Dawn discovers a stronger sense of its own personality in one game than Killzone ever managed across half a dozen. Guerrilla Games has long been developing some of the most buzzed-about games in the industry; with Horizon, it feels like it has finally found its own voice, one worthy of all that buzz."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"Horizon Zero Dawn reinvigorates open-world RPGs with an excellent story, creative science fiction, and demanding gameplay. Aloy¡¦s debut is one of PS4¡¦s greatest games."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"Horizon: Zero Dawn is just brilliant. I speak as a critic who has played more ""open sandbox"" games than any one human should and has grown so very weary of them. I should have gotten sick of this thing in an hour, but I've been glued to it for days and days and I don't want it to end. I love existing in this world - a world of desperate survival but of growing culture and a sense of hope. A world of giant metal animals that promise some breathtaking fights."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"It¡¦s been a long time since a game has been put together this well. The combat is awesome, the visuals are stunning, and Aloy is 100% badass."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"I am happy to see that Horizon: Zero Dawn is not just a huge balloon inflated with hype, but that they've really done a good job in injecting a lot of personality with good technical achievements that characterize them and also the creation of a World with interesting characters, a good campaign and so much depth in their spaces and societies that we very much crave to return in future sequels."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,Horizon Zero Dawn is as good as everybody expected. A powerful narrative and solid gameplay make this Guerrilla game one of the best titles that 2017 has to offer.
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"Across a vast and beautiful open world, Horizon: Zero Dawn juggles many moving parts with polish and finesse. Its main activity - combat - is extremely satisfying thanks to the varied design and behaviors of machine-creatures that roam its lands, each of which needs to be taken down with careful consideration. Though side questing could have been more imaginative, its missions are compelling thanks to a central mystery that led me down a deep rabbit hole to a genuinely surprising - and moving - conclusion."

2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"Horizon: Zero Dawn is an enormous, ambitious curve ball from the studio behind the promising but perennially flawed Killzone series. In Aloy, the game introduces an enchanting protagonist and sets her on a remarkable adventure that steers clear of rote sci-fi...Horizon emerges as a graceful, intoxicating and often surprising adventure. [April 2017, p.108]"
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"Horizon Zero Dawn is a love letter to the finer details, as they reinvigorate an open-world setting in startling ways. Its tight combat and engrossing world are icing on a package that just shines from all angles, making it an easy recommendation to not only play on PS4, but to buy one in the first place."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"Horizon is a special game, one which puts forth a very confident spin on action-RPG conventions and on the idea of a post-apocalyptic survival tale, but also one that will engross you in its mystery and poke at common humanistic ideas from an angle we don't see a whole lot. That said, it certainly doesn't hurt that it's amazing to look at and has heaps of cool robots to blow up, and its actual game mechanics are just as engaging as the story it tells."

2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"There is a certain appeal to Horizon: Zero Dawn which I have not found in any other open-world RPG game. Perhaps it is the addition of shiny robots to the mix or the story of Aloy herself. Either way, this game has my full attention and I wouldn't call it anything less than stellar. If I had to compare it to another game, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and Shadow of Mordor would be on the top of my list. When compared to these two titles, Horizon is riddled with less bugs, more engaging combat, and successfully incorporates stealth gameplay. Try and guess what I¡¦ll be playing for the next few weeks."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"Dark Souls, Far Cry Primal (or any open world Ubisoft game), Uncharted ¡V these are just a few of the games players will cite when finding points of comparison for Horizon: Zero Dawn. But the Guerrilla Games developers have made sure that its game still feels unique by comparison, thanks to a vibrant world bursting with stunning detail, challenging robotic enemies, and a story that explores an uncivilized world in an inventive way. Some weak AI, awkward dialogue sections, and a prototypical open world framework are the game¡¦s bigger faults, but they don¡¦t weigh the game down to much or ruin the experience. When all is said and done, Horizon: Zero Dawn could easily be Sony¡¦s next great franchise, but even as a one-off it¡¦s very impressive."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"When I began Horizon: Zero Dawn, I was anxious it wouldn't be able to maintain itself for thirty-plus hours. I'm thrilled that fear was unfounded. The play was constantly rich and rewarding, and the mysteries constantly unfolding. I'm left not just feeling satisfied the entire time, but wanting more. This one is something special."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"No, Horizon probably isn¡¦t as monumental of an experience as playing Uncharted or God of War for the first time, but it¡¦s well-made, engaging and probably worth your time."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"Debuts don't get much stronger than Horizon: Zero Dawn. Guerrilla Games' latest borrows liberally from a variety of different sources, and yet it leverages these fundamentals to forge an experience that's daringly unique. The main quest tires a little towards the end, and the writing never hits the same highs as The Witcher 3 ¡V but the tactical action stands leagues ahead of what we've come to expect from the genre, and the presentation is quite simply unmatched."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"Horizon Zero Dawn is a stunningly gorgeous game, an awesome open world action-RPG that overcomes the gameplay conventions of the genre by giving you so many options on how to tackle combat. It does stumble a bit trying to tell a cohesive story, but I was too caught up in exploring all the little details of the world to let that bother me."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"This is a culmination of everything Guerrilla has learned from working on the Killzone franchise and they've successfully crafted something that delivers on the potential many saw back in 2015. Horizon Zero Dawn is not only one of the best-looking games of this generation, but a must own for every PlayStation 4 owner."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,Guerilla Games has delivered one of the best open-world games of this generation.
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"Horizon Zero Dawn is an amazing game and a gorgeous experience, crafted with elements and ideas from many other games. Despite its lack OF originality, this product from Guerrilla Games is a great piece of work."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"A likeable new protagonist in Aloy, alongside a compelling story, deep combat system and stunning visuals ¡V Guerrilla Games has already raised the bar this year for exclusives with Horizon: Zero Dawn."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"Few new licenses have been successful in setting the bar so high. Thanks to its varied, dazzling landscapes, its controlled rhythm, and sharp gameplay, Aloy's quest redefines what immersion in an open world means, if it does not revolutionize the genre."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"Even though it's not without its issues, Horizon is an excellent title and a must have for all PS4 owners. It offers a refreshing open world environment, a compelling and mysterious story, a fantastic main character, and innovative gameplay. Not only is it one of the best action RPGs I've played in a while, it's also one of the best games I've played in a while. Even now, after the credits have rolled, I'm still having a great time trying to fully complete the game. Horizon is a truly special experience, and it's one that even non-RPG lovers need to have."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,A spectacular and entertaining open world adventure that becomes one of the must-have exclusives of PS4.
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"None of Horizon's faults stopped me from sinking 55 hours into the game, or walking away supremely satisfied with the experience. Horizon may not be a revolution for the open-world genre, but it is a highly polished and compelling adventure that proves Guerrilla is more than a single franchise."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"Horizon is a kind of rough diamond. It has great value but some flaws too, especially regarding the voice acting and the fights against humans. Having said that, Guerrilla has managed to create a believable world full of great moments."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"Horizon: Zero Dawn is a successful ""first time"" for Guerrilla in the open world genre. The game isn't perfect, but it's gorgeous to see and explore (best open world graphics ever) and offers engaging fights against fascinating machines."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"Like with God of War and Uncharted before, Horizon: Zero Dawn should be the start of another PlayStation iconic franchise. It offers a gorgeous and interesting world rich with adventure (including plenty of giant robots to kill). While it borrows heavily from the likes of Far Cry, it¡¦s a more interesting and less repetitive effort than we¡¦ve seen from that series. The presentation suffers a few hiccups, but it¡¦s mostly a beautiful game. It¡¦s also a long one. Horizon will keep you busy for a good chunk of time with its multitude of side-quests and extra activities. This is one of the PlayStation 4¡¦s most interesting exclusives."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"This action roleplaying game demonstrates not only the technical competence of Guerilla Games. In terms of storytelling, quest design and characterization it almost reaches The Witcher 3. So even with its flaws like the abundance of crafting material and the superficial close combat this is another great franchise for the PS4."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"Horizon: Zero Dawn represents the birth of a new and promising IP, thanks to a clever concept, solid combat mechanics and an outstanding presentation. Having said that, it can be repetitive at times and the lack of spontaneity stops Horizon: Zero Dawn from being a true classic."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"A few years ago, Guerrilla Games gave us a sneak peek of something great. Today, we receive an artistic open-world game with an extremely fun hunting adventure with unusual targets."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"A perfect example of strong, competent and enjoyable gameplay. It doesn't reinvent the genre, but it's a lot of fun to play. The mecha-dino combat is the highlight and represents some of the most enjoyable open-world combat on the market. Burning through powerful foes and looting their corpses for rare treasures captures an excitement rarely felt in open-world games. The rest of the gameplay is somewhat dulled in comparison. A somewhat weak plot drags down the experience but isn't enough to detract from the enjoyment."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"Horizon: Zero Dawn marks Guerilla Games' return to form and is a showcase for what PS4 can do. Of course, it's far from perfect but thanks to diverse landscapes, excellent graphics and wildly satisfying combat mechanics Horizon looks really impressive. Just don't let the boring first two hours discourage you."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"Horizon Zero Dawn is an excellent open-world experience that puts fighting towering robots at the center of the action. It¡¦s held back somewhat by its weak narrative, and occasional glitches, but that doesn¡¦t stop it from being the most badass game I¡¦ve played this year."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"Horizon Zero Dawn is a beautiful open world action adventure with some light RPG elements. It has a good and interesting story in addition to excellent hunting mechanics, but there's also a lack of character diversity and personalities."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,Horizon Zero Dawn is the gaming equivalent of realizing that sounding too much like the legends¡Xwhen done well¡Xis just fine.
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"Guerrilla Games made their first open world game playing straight every trope in the book. In her time off from story missions, Aloy-from-the-future will do the same stuff as Renaissance Ezio and Stone Age tribal from Far Cry Primal did: she¡¦ll capture towers, liberate camps, look for collectibles, and, of course, hunt to craft bigger quivers and larger bags. [Issue#217, p.48]"
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"Although Horizon Zero Dawn is a variation on the tested ¡§ubigame¡¨ formula and fails to even get close to The Witcher 3 in terms of utilizing the open world, amazing setting makes it a beautiful science fiction fairy tale that manages to stay gripping till the very end. [04/2017, p.62]"
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"It might not be Witcher III level of excellence, but for a first attempt from Guerrilla, it¡¦s impressively close."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,Horizon: Zero Dawn is a stellar open world game. Guerrilla has crafted a magnificent and utterly gorgeous adventure game with surprising depth that rewards player skill and will more than likely prove to be PS4's next major action franchise. It's just a shame the game's open world is so desperate to validate its own existence that it never lets you truly enjoy the thrill of the hunt.
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"By borrowing many ideas from other games (the reboot of Tomb Raider and Far Cry Primal to be more specific) Guerilla¡¦s maiden voyage into the ¡§open-world¡¨ genre is quite successful, engaging and charming, but not without its flaws."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,It is wish fulfillment of a high order: Eden 2.0 with gadgets.
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"It¡¦s a world unlike any other, offering traits borrowed and traits new. And it¡¦s one of the most captivating open worlds you¡¦ve ever experienced."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"Horizon: Zero Dawn is simply great fun to play ¡V the open world and fantastic enemies make it easy to get on board with the surreal premise which Guerrilla Games has crafted. The challenging gameplay always tempts you to push past the next mountain, through new cities or delving into caves to discover new beasts, secrets and gear...Its razor-sharp graphics will have you relentlessly hitting the PS4's share button, even if the story can't quite capture you in the same way."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"From its gorgeous landscapes to its interesting combat, the game feels like a world begging to be explored. However, some of its systems feel half-baked and shoehorned into the mix, creating a lopsided experience at times."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,On the one hand Horizon: Zero Dawn is an ambitious technological showpiece for Sony¡¦s new PlayStation Pro platform and a visual benchmark for this console generation. And yet its underlying hunter/gathering gameplay mechanics and zonal map architecture have barely evolved from their obvious origins in the long-established franchises Far Cry and Tomb Raider.
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"Horizon Zero Dawn offers an entirely unique world and a thrilling experience as an action game, complete with a great story and likeable characters. It doesn't reach its grand RPG aspirations, but the highs are so memorable and entertaining that it's easy to forgive the shortcomings."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"Aloy¡¦s quest through the post-post-apocalypse is one of pros and cons. Encounters with robotic wildlife are equal parts tactical and reflexive, but fights against humans are awkward, and the camera is unwieldly. The world is lush and gorgeous, but traversing it can be a chore. Horizon Zero Dawn is a breath of fresh air, and a welcome departure from Guerrilla¡¦s previous offerings ¡V but the journey takes some missteps."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"From a technical standpoint, the game is a real darling and can compete with the best of them. And yet it¡¦s that the game doesn¡¦t really break away from any of the pre-existing molds that I believe hold it back from being the breakout hit of 2017. It feels almost too conventional. Whether it¡¦s the Ubisoft style side missions, the Batman Arkham vision or the by the numbers storytelling. There¡¦s nothing about Horizon Zero Dawn that breaks out into its own unique experience. I absolutely loved this game. I think it¡¦s a fantastic adventure full of amazing experiences to be had and fully recommend it to anyone who owns a Playstation 4. And yet it does feel like the first game in a series that needs to discover its own unique identity to help it stand out amongst a vast array of open world games that it competes against."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"The open-world sensations of Horizon Zero Dawn are some of the best of the current console generation. Climbing snow-capped mountains and crawling through verdant valleys never fails to be as exciting. This apocalyptic wasteland feels remarkably dynamic, with randomized characters and enemies roaming the world and creating emergent encounters...Though Horizon doesn¡¦t represent a revolution in open-world adventures, it borrows heavily from past success stories and elevates the genre to a beautiful new standard."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"Destroying large robot beasts while frantically switching between weapons is intoxicating, but the strength of Horizon Zero Dawn is in Aloy's engaging quest to find out who she really is."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"State-of-the-art visuals help create one of gaming¡¦s most entertaining open worlds, even if the gameplay doesn¡¦t quite reach the same standards."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"Horizon Zero Dawn feels like a franchise in the making. While not packed with narrative high points, it¡¦s still a compelling introduction to a world in turmoil that answers a lot of questions, but still gestures toward a more climactic future. Its primary element, squaring off against mechanized animals, is such a success, it makes up for the ongoing repetition of the game¡¦s activities. When we look into Horizon¡¦s future, we see a sequel that can take this world and make it into something remarkable."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"Horizon: Zero Dawn is a bit of a slow burn, but there's more to Guerrilla Games' latest than just its staggeringly pretty graphics. The story surprises as it takes several twists and turns and explores the past, but the games beating heart is with its excellently tense and engaging robotic monster hunting."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"There is enough spectacular action to keep you occupied for a couple of weeks, but Horizon is not the hot new killer app for PS4."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,Horizon Zero Dawn is a fascinating premise wrapped in a tortilla of tropes.
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"The creative team needs to find writers willing to back up the narrative context with a story that has meat, and the gameplay designers need to dare do things differently to what has come before. Horizon is a remarkably refined and technically brilliant game, but Guerrilla has yet to prove that it can take that next step and produce a genuine classic."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"For all the hype that¡¦s been extended to Horizon: Zero Dawn, it hasn¡¦t managed to fully deliver. That¡¦s a bit fitting ¡X while we didn¡¦t have access to its day one patch, confirmed by Eschler to enhance the PS4 Pro experience, I really didn¡¦t notice an increased framerate or up-then-downrezzed textures on my 1080p television. Truly, there¡¦s a lot of promise and potential in Guerrilla¡¦s latest work, but ideas and intentions haven¡¦t come together in a way that¡¦s jaw-dropping."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"The sad fact for Horizon, and every other open-world game like it, is that we now live in a post-Witcher 3 world. CD Projekt Red has raised the bar for this genre in nearly every conceivable way, and it is absolutely not enough to simply be another open-world game. The sidequests have to be interesting, the writing has to be engaging, the characters have to be memorable ¡V just putting a good premise and great graphics on top of boilerplate content isn¡¦t enough. At least, it¡¦s not enough for this reviewer."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"The unfortunate fact of Horizon is that most of what it does well, other games have done better, and they did it with a compelling who and where. This is the game you play after you¡¦ve finished The Witcher 3, Assassin¡¦s Creed: Syndicate, and Far Cry: Primal. It is the greatest hits compilation of open-world games. Yeah, sure, you might want to own it, but the real connoisseur has the original albums."
2017,Horizon Zero Dawn,"Horizon Zero Dawn is disappointing. It has a story that I struggled to care about (complete with massive expository dumps¡Xyay), a bland protagonist, and overtly repetitive and constraining missions that worked against its open world sensibilities. When Horizon Zero Dawn hit its rare strides¡Xfrom its gloomy Cauldrons to traveling across its sprawling vistas¡Xit only made me wish the rest of the game were as worthwhile."
2017,Persona 5,"The brilliant Japanese RPG, which nails you to your chair for a hundred hours, and you still feel it's not enough. Finally, the whole world will learn about the exceptionality of this series. [Issue#274]"
2017,Persona 5,"Is there a more accomplished, accessible, brilliantly precocious example of the modern JRPG? Can¡¦t think of one. [May 2017, p62]"
2017,Persona 5,"It¡¦s the sort of game that only comes around once every few years. It¡¦s a game that is so unique in every aspect that it¡¦d be impossible to mistake a single moment of it for anything else. It¡¦s also a game about real life, despite the wacky hijinks you¡¦ll often find yourself in. It¡¦s about the moments you have with your friends, laughing around a hot pot as you make jokes only those there would understand. It¡¦s within those moments that Persona 5 enters a league of its own, untouched by its contemporaries in every respect."
2017,Persona 5,"With Persona 5, Atlus has once again proven that it is the master of the modern JRPG. With terrific style, addictive gameplay, and an engaging, thought-provoking story, Persona 5 not only matches, but often exceeds its predecessors, one of which RPGamer even declared its RPG of the Decade back in 2010. It is an exceptionally long game, with most players likely to expect over one hundred hours for a single playthrough, but the investment is well worth it. Persona 5 is a remarkable game that shouldn't be missed."
2017,Persona 5,"I¡¦m absolutely in love with this game, and if you haven¡¦t given it a shot yet, I think you¡¦ll find a lot to love about Persona 5 too. It¡¦s not a huge departure from Persona 3 or 4, but there¡¦s been some noticeable changes and improvements made that do make a difference, all of which are for the better. The dungeon variations, the stealth mechanics, and even the ease with which you can navigate the overworld map are noticeably better than before. So even if you¡¦ve felt a little lukewarm about the series up until now, I¡¦d still urge you to give Persona 5 a try."
2017,Persona 5,"While it¡¦s easy to rattle off the merits of the various gameplay systems and gush about the presentation, those aren¡¦t the things that make Persona 5 stick with you. It¡¦s a game that¡¦s willing to comment on the issues of today both in a broader sense and on a personal level. It doesn¡¦t just have typical characters but rather people that you come to know by investing serious time in them. Persona 5 honors the now decades-old Shin Megami Tensei legacy without feeling content to stay within its limits, serving as a prime example of what a modern JRPG should be."
2017,Persona 5,"Persona 5 isn't just a rank and file member of Japan's streak of game of the year contenders in 2017, it's a blistering RPG masterpiece that cements itself among the all-time greats. Tagging along with the Phantom Thieves of Hearts on their psychedelic capers triggers a contact high of dazzling sights and sounds, with enough thematic depth to match its relentless swagger. It's a game that'll try to steal your own heart, and you'll willingly oblige."
2017,Persona 5,"Persona 5 is a JRPG that deserves to be played, period. There are few other games that understand their genre as well as Persona 5 does. It knows exactly what Persona fans, JRPG fans, and gamers in general want to see. It¡¦s not just a game, it¡¦s an addiction, and if you give it a shot you too will find yourself playing and replaying Persona 5 for the better part of 2017."
2017,Persona 5,"Persona 5 is a massive game. Dozens upon dozens of hours, even on the critical path, are eaten alive before you even notice it. It achieves this with a level of production that rivals even a Final Fantasy game, albeit on a wildly different plane. There are some hiccups, such as fuzzy textures (this is also on PS3, mind) and some awkward camera/movement, but as soon as the next eye-catching visual effect pops up or the next exciting cutscene with legitimately upsetting villains unravels, it¡¦s like nothing else in your surroundings matters. Persona 5 is special, even more so for people who have been paying attention to this series for the past few decades. Just, you know, clear your calendar for a while."
2017,Persona 5,"A brilliant way forward for the most traditional side of the JRPG, an example for the genre that should be taking into account for the future."
2017,Persona 5,"Persona 5 may not pull up many trees in terms of innovation, but it refines and refreshes the things that make a great RPG work. The real star of the show however, is the world this RPG inhabits, and the people in it that you come to adore. Persona 5 is something to sink your entire self into, and end up feeling utterly despondent about when you finally have to leave its stylish embrace."
2017,Persona 5,"At its core this is a spectacular work of contemporary young adult fiction, one with a strong moral core, angled yet never didactic, expansive yet always focused."
2017,Persona 5,"Girls and boys, Persona 5 is simply the new king of Japanese role playing games, and it may even be 2016's game of the year. The story is so deep, the battle system is so well-executed, the art direction is so amazing and the music is so groovy! I instantly felt in love with this game and I am pretty sure you will too."
2017,Persona 5,"Atlus has spent the last decade trying to make this niche JPRG franchise more prominent in the west, and Persona 5 deserves to be the game that finally takes the series from obscure to mainstream. Not only is it true to the series¡¦ roots as well as a great starting point for the series, it¡¦s a fantastic game, period. A hundred hours might not even feel like enough time; my first thought upon seeing the credits roll was ¡§Is it too soon for New Game Plus?¡¨ Persona 5 is something very special, so never fear, JRPG fans: it was worth the wait."
2017,Persona 5,"With the most bewitching tale the series has ever told and an incredibly likable cast that rises above their typical archetypes, Persona 5 sings a song of rebellion. Not just against the norm of JRPGs, but of society's oppressive grasp, inspiring its players to rise up as the Phantom Thieves would. In the end, in spite of its minor missteps, Persona 5 has the power to steal the hearts of longterm fans of the series and newcomers alike."
2017,Persona 5,"Persona 5 is the pinnacle of the JRPG genre, showcasing for one of the few times in history what it's like when a beautiful story is assisted by great gameplay. This is a game with a wonderful personality, and one with more content than just about any other single-player game you can name...Persona 5 might have arrived with subtlety like a cool breeze, but its tailwinds will leave behind a confident and meaningful reminder that JRPGs are alive and well."
2017,Persona 5,"The voice acting is outstanding, the music is genius, the art style is so slick it'll raise your personal coolness level just from being in close proximity to it. Playing Persona 5 will make your hair glossier, increase your vocal range by an octave and add 7.32 years to your overall life expectancy. Play it enough times and you'll likely not only be able to levitate but also make a perfect omelette while in midair. It's THAT good."
2017,Persona 5,"Persona 5 sets the benchmark for modern Japanese RPGs: it oozes style, charisma, and polish quite unlike anything we've played. With this fifth entry, the series' trademark formula of dungeon delving and socialising has been perfected. Addictive, engaging gameplay, incredibly endearing characters, and a consistently rewarding narrative loop combine to create a spectacularly cohesive whole ¡V whether or not you're already a fan of Persona. A masterpiece from top to bottom."
2017,Persona 5,"You'll struggle to find a more complete, self-assured, forward-thinking, and simply joyous example of the modern JRPG than this. Persona 5 knows what it is and is unashamed about it. The result is a game that, for all its themes about imprisonment and societal slavery, is free of shackles itself. That freedom makes it series-defining, genre-defining, and a must-play."
2017,Persona 5,"Persona 5 stole my heart. It was impossible to see that the best game of the already venerated series was yet to come, and yet somehow everything works wonderfully. I¡¦d rather the dialogue didn¡¦t pad things out as much as it did, but I was captivated from beginning to end, it brought back mechanics long thought out-dated, and introduced smart changes for the better. An essential RPG for 2017 that you should not miss out on."
2017,Persona 5,Persona 5 is one of the best games I have had the pleasure of playing and something that managed topping my favourite game of all time Persona 4 Golden in almost every way.
2017,Persona 5,"Whether you¡¦re a series fan, a JRPG evangelist or a total turn-based newcomer, this is an essential play. Persona 5 is packed with stuff to do, expertly put together and exquisite to the last pixel. An unabashed masterpiece. [Issue#134]"
2017,Persona 5,"This is one of the best games we've ever played. We thought the series had peaked, but Atlus has proved us wrong. Unless you hate RPGs, you shouldn't miss it."
2017,Persona 5,"Persona 5 is a massive, gorgeous JRPG with well over 100 hours of gameplay for completionists. With more to do than ever and the series¡¦ strongest story to date, it stands out as an extraordinary, memorable experience and easily one of the deepest JRPGs of the last decade. Its sprawling dungeon design and stylish, fully realized world are an absolute joy to explore, and even after three playthroughs and the Platinum trophy, I find myself itching to go back to try different dialogue options with Confidants or revisit particularly fun puzzles. This is a new gold standard for Japanese RPGs and by far the best entry in the series yet."
2017,Persona 5,"Persona 5 is full of style and confidence. Persona 5 knows that it's special, and you'll soon know it, too."
2017,Persona 5,"Surpassing its predecessors in every way, Persona 5 redefines the Japanese RPG with a stylish band of rogues that should please any fan of the genre."
2017,Persona 5,Persona 5 is one of the best JRPGs ever: a must-have for fans and an incredible title for any neophyte who wants to approach the genre. A true masterpiece.
2017,Persona 5,"Persona 5 is not just a deep and competent role playing game but also one of the better written RPGs ever. Everything just clicks and resonates with players on different levels, depending on their private life and social experiences. Persona 5 is almost educational and, by the end, it makes you look at your life - and videogames alike - in a new, different way."
2017,Persona 5,"I'm glad to say that Persona 5 is everything I had hoped it would be and then some. The incremental improvements over the gameplay of Persona 4, the visuals, the soundtrack, all of it came together almost perfectly. That translation could have used a little bit more polish, but otherwise this is the finest work Atlus has ever produced."
2017,Persona 5,"A personality-filled, stylish adventure with gripping mechanics that drill deep into your brain. [Apr 2017, p.66]"
2017,Persona 5,"Persona 5 has redefined a genre of gaming and is a must-play title for every RPG gamer. Much like Persona 4 Golden was a reason to own a PSVita, Persona 5 is a reason to own a PS4. Like FFVII made you fall in love with JRPG¡¦s 20 years ago, Persona 5 will steal your heart."
2017,Persona 5,"Persona 5 tries to captivate the player in every possible way. Its masterful mix of genres, crisp art style, and music, as well as the glorious game mechanics won't let you drop the controller until the very end. This iteration of the franchise sets a new standard for the JRPG genre and it is, naturally, an excellent addition to the Best of 2017 games list."
2017,Persona 5,"Persona 5 is hands down the best game in the Persona series. Hell, it well may be the best JRPG of the last decade. Apart from small minor issues, the game itself is a JRPG masterpiece: The graphics and music compliment the style of the game beautifully, the story is the best in the series, the locations and palaces you visit are astounding and the battle system has been revitalized and feels fresh and new. This game didn't just match people's expectations ¡V it created new ones for the future."
2017,Persona 5,"Persona 5 brings to light modern issues in a powerful, symbolic story of youthful rebellion. Outfitted with a stylish aesthetic and complex systems, it confidently pulls off moments of grandeur and intimate moments of character growth to create a remarkable experience."
2017,Persona 5,"Great game! The new Persona is not for everyone, but those who aren't averse to anime will be drawn to the characters and captivated by the adventure, which is one of the best in recent years in games of this type. I only hope that Atlus won't make us wait for over half a decade for the next installment in the series."
2017,Persona 5,"Persona 5 is proof that few titles can compare to a truly great role-playing game. Over its 60 hour playtime I got to forge meaningful friendships with an eccentric cast of characters, discover the secrets of Tokyo, and even managed to find some nice restaurants to dine at. The time investment might seem like a lot, but rarely is time wasted when spent with friends. It doesn¡¦t reinvent the genre, as it largely builds upon Persona 4¡¥s stellar base, but it adds a level of polish that is simply lacking from its contemporaries."
2017,Persona 5,"Persona 5 delivers on its lofty promises with an emotional story, deep and innovative gameplay elements, and a unique style. It's as good as the series has ever gotten - and perhaps even better."
2017,Persona 5,"Persona 5 is an essential play for all jRPG fans. Incredibly unique in its style, with a varied and deep battle system, Persona 5 will enchant you with its plot and its interweaving of perfectly designed Tokyo."
2017,Persona 5,"Starting from the art direction, following with the gameplay elements and ending with the plot and anything that comes to your mind, Persona 5 is an invaluable masterpiece. It doesn't redefine its genre but it's outstanding in all of his aspects."
2017,Persona 5,"The social criticism that Persona 5 shows is shocking, making the game industry more mature in the process and proving that deep game mechanics and narrative, even with their incompatibilities, can coexist and benefit from each other."
2017,Persona 5,"The new game made by Atlus is astonishing, mesmerizing and ambitious, characterized by a stunning art design, an intense storyline and an elaborate combat system. Without any doubt, Persona 5 is one of the greatest JRPGs of this generation."
2017,Persona 5,"With engaging social simulation gameplay, addictive turn-based combat systems and an unmatched visual style, Persona 5 is the ultimate Japanese role-playing game any PlayStation 4 owner, newbie or hardcore fan, should give a fair go in 2017."
2017,Persona 5,"Persona 5 is simply one of the greatest games and JRPGs in recent years. Atlus exceeded itself with one incredible title that not only offers an even better and perfected formula from its fantastic predecessor (Persona 4), but it also shows how a series can evolve with a few additions and accurate adjustments. With its unique, dark and enjoyable story; cast of memorable characters; a fluid and addictive battle system; and a wide variety of activities to engage in, it is simply impossible to find any reason to deprive yourself of this great experience. Even if you are not a fan of the genre, this is a title you should play at any cost."
2017,Persona 5,"Persona 5 beats every other turn-based RPG in terms of production values, combat, story, symbolics, character design, music, pace and variety. 2017 is a great year for gaming and Persona 5 confirms this with a load of unmatched swagger."
2017,Persona 5,"Persona 5 took the best parts of its predecessors and carefully evolved them without making any earth-shattering changes. The result is a more or less traditional Japanese RPG, but it¡¦s so good that I¡¦m ready to go on a limb and declare it one of the best JRPGs of the decade. If not *the* best."
2017,Persona 5,"Persona 5 is an incredible gaming experience. With so much to do, so many elements all perfectly balanced and perfected, it¡¦s a showcase of great game design. After 10 years, the wait has been well worth it, and Persona 5 has somehow exceeded our expectations and shown us once again why this is the best JRPG series of all time."
2017,Persona 5,"Persona 5 could be the best JPRG you have ever played. An intriguing journey featuring themes like friendship, morality and justice. Satisfying turn-based combat and the creation of Personas make this game more than just a beautiful interactive novel."
2017,Persona 5,"Artistically refreshing, fun, deep and long. One of the best RPGs that we are going to see in 2017... But it's only in English, which is a mayor flaw in Spain."
2017,Persona 5,"If the opening hours of Persona 5 are like starting a massive novel, then the closing hours are like finishing one, complete with the bittersweet finality of turning the last page. But it also carries an immense sense of satisfaction. After 100 hours of playing, all of my big questions were answered. I understood the characters, I knew my way around the world, and I had fun almost every step of the journey. You become a resident of Persona 5 the more you play it, and it has the rare ability to transport in a way few games can."
2017,Persona 5,"The last chapter of one of our favourite series improved over the previous chapters in every, possible way. The storyline is unique and much more consistent, and the production values (art direction, soundtrack, dubbing, graphics) are simply top-notch. The fact that the dungeons aren't randomly generated anymore is just the cherry on top."
2017,Persona 5,"A huge, weird, elaborate, gloomy, and thrilling masterpiece and the new king of JRPGs."
2017,Persona 5,"For the 20th anniversary of their role-playing saga, Atlus delivered a true masterpiece. All the elements, big or small or as trivial as they might seem sometimes, are well put together and interconnect in an almost unnoticeable manner. Plus: The presentation is plainly beautiful with a coherent colorful manga/anime art design that is a perfect fit for one of the best JRPGs out there."
2017,Persona 5,"Persona 5 is a great example of quality jRPG game, with a good story, great battle system and fabulous artistic style, this is a must have for the fans of the series and the genre."
2017,Persona 5,"Ultimately, the rest of the Japanese RPG genre is still playing catch-up....It's stolen our hearts. [Issue#186, p.76]"
2017,Persona 5,"It¡¦s the best Persona game to date and when you reach end credits after a hundred or so hours, it¡¦s hard not to feel the pang of sorrow when you realize that the huge, multilayered story is over and you have to say goodbye to virtual friends you¡¦ve made. [06/2017, p.34]"
2017,Persona 5,"An excellent sequel of the series that will allow you to spend a year in the skin of a high school student and during that time shape the future of the world. It offers nearly a 100 hour experience that blends JRPG with adventure, logical puzzles, and dating simulation. It entertains all the time, even though sometimes it can frustrate with its cruelty. It¡¦s a must have for the fans of the previous games, and an ideal startup title for the newcomers."
2017,Persona 5,Persona 5 is an exquisitely put together RPG overflowing with incredible style and a main cast you will sorely miss when the game is done. It¡¦s easily the best RPG I¡¦ve played in a few years.
2017,Persona 5,Persona 5 was worth the wait. The developers have delivered a classic and elegant Japanese RPG with the unique style that made Persona 5 a one of a kind game.
2017,Persona 5,"The fifth installment in the Persona series is one the best ever in JRPG genre. Everything the fans have expected, including great story, unforgettable characters, deep and satisfying gameplay and beautiful art design are on offer here. And though the game is suffering from some graphical and sound design issues, it still is one of the best JRPGs available on the market."
2017,Persona 5,"Persona 5 will be beautiful forever. Meticulous thought and consideration has been applied to Shin Megami Tensei's durable model of dungeon crawling and Persona's paragon of social simulation, creating a brilliant pulse visible through (almost) every aspect of its performance. Keeping this pace across a formidable length is Persona 5's most impressive trick, ensuring it will steal your heart without wasting your time."
2017,Persona 5,"Its Atlus's watershed moment¡Xwhich is to say, the moment they allowed the Persona series to truly grow up and earn that ¡§M for Mature¡¨ rating."
2017,Persona 5,"Persona 5 is certainly one of the sleekest and most polished JRPGs I¡¦ve played in years, crowned by intriguing themes, enjoyable plot twists and uplifting moments that will make you smile. While the formula did not change that much since Persona 4: Golden, this is an instant classic that I¡¦ll remember for a long, long time...Persona 5 made me fume, cry, smile and laugh all the way through the 166 hours I played it, and that is doubtlessly a testament to the exceptional experience this ultimate Japanese high schooler simulator provides."
2017,Persona 5,"It¡¦s huge, but Persona 5 never outstays its welcome. If you¡¦re a JRPG fan without a PS4, this is the game that fully justifies the purchase."
2017,Persona 5,"Although Persona 5 deals with the everyday angst of your average, magic-wielding teenagers, it is epic in almost every conceivable way, from its combat to its sprawling and surprise-laden story. While some of its large cast of characters strike a sour note and its gameplay can challenge the impatient player, Persona 5 somehow manages the improbable feat of being both an ultimate reward to fans of the franchise and a perfect gateway to newcomers."
2017,Persona 5,"It may have taken Atlus quite a long time to complete the fifth Persona game, but this was time well spent! Persona 5 is a superb JRPG filled with social messages, great gameplay and some new ideas that take the franchise to the next level."
2017,Persona 5,"Persona 5 is an improvement over the last two games in almost every way. There may be some arguments over which game has the best cast, but the mechanics, visuals and general style can't be denied. It fixes a lot of nagging flaws and adds a bunch of features that are so useful it's difficult to imagine ever playing without them. Some minor issues, including a sometimes-stiff translation and a low difficulty level, hurt the experience slightly but should only be considered minor flaws. If you're a fan of RPGs, you have to get Persona 5, which is easily one of the best games available on the PS4."
2017,Persona 5,"With all the issues I had with the game, it doesn¡¦t take away from the fact that Persona 5 is one of the best games in the series, as well as one of the best JRPGs to come out in years. The story is well told and exciting while still being emotional, the combat is fun and really engrossing and allows for some great combinations, and the presentation is both stylish and really fun. There is so much to do in this game that it would take another three pages to go over it all, and in the end, if I haven¡¦t convinced you to pick this game up by now, I have nothing else to give you. If you¡¦re an RPG fan by any means, you need to get this game. It¡¦s a great time with both deep mechanics and a deep story. Not to mention, it oozes style the entire time."
2017,Persona 5,Persona 5 smoothly surpasses previous entries in the franchise with its stylish coat of paint and emotive storytelling.
2017,Persona 5,"Persona 5 is a game that contains all of the brilliant elements from the series. It also has made the series' most irritating concept into something that you don¡¦t have to play, and you¡¦ll be totally fine without it."
2017,Persona 5,Persona 5 is by far the best JRPG of the last decade. It gives a fresh sense of gameplay while still maintaining its core elements. A true masterpiece of fine arts.
2017,Persona 5,"Persona 5 is more than a mix of life sim and JRPG: the game combines everything to tell an amazing story. Persona-fans expect this already, but Persona 5 takes things to the next level thanks to its intimate atmosphere."
2017,Persona 5,"The Phantom Thieves did not just steal the hearts of their targets: also our hearts are stolen. The new cast, carefully designed dungeons and tweaks on the existing mechanics make Persona 5 the best game in the franchise."
2017,Persona 5,"It¡¦s a spectacular RPG experience that is truly in a league of its own, and fans of the series and the genre in general owe it to themselves to check it out."
2017,Persona 5,"For many people, Persona 5 is the best JRPG in years. It is a wonderful and psychological journey to the dark side of humans, with dynamic combat by turns and aesthetics that are very colorful and alive. Here you have many hours of play, activities, social links and elegance. Atlus must continue this series: it can go very far."
2017,Persona 5,What makes this weird game so irresistible is how well it juggles being a social simulator and a dungeon crawler.
2017,Persona 5,"It¡¦s hard not to wish that Persona 5 had taken more influence from Catherine than it did, but as the culmination of the past ten years of the Persona series, it still stands as one of the best Japanese RPGs to exist¡Xand a visual masterpiece whose style has no equal."
2017,Persona 5,"Weighing in at over 100 hours of gameplay, Persona 5 is one that you will want to spend time with. Brilliant voice work, a decent translation and solid gameplay mechanics make this one of the best RPGs I¡¦ve played in a long time."
2017,Persona 5,"After more than eight years Persona 5 is finally here ¡V and it is well-worth the wait. The lengthy adventure never gets boring thanks to a fantastic combat system, great characters and lots of different things to do. While it may not be perfect, it is the best and most accessible Persona game yet ¡V and the best Japanese role playing game in many years."
2017,Persona 5,"It successfully pushes this series to new heights of polish, allure and charm. It has a few blemishes, enough to distract a bit from the intriguing and weighty themes that the game wrestles with. But even through the rough patches, Persona 5 doesn¡¦t give up a drop of its colorful personality."
2017,Persona 5,"Persona 5 is one of the best JRPGs in recent memory, overflowing with originality, entertainment and straight up weirdness. It¡¦s pretty damn good."
2017,Persona 5,"It's stuffed to bursting point with gameplay ideas and presentation flourishes--there's an overwhelming level of artistry in every part of Persona 5, making it a truly standout entry in the series. It's a refined, effortlessly stylish RPG that will be talked about for years to come."
2017,Persona 5,Persona 5 is a beautiful balancing act; one that feels eternally stressful unless you give in and enjoy it rather than aiming for the perfect run.
2017,Persona 5,"If you didn't dig Persona 4, this is your gateway back into the Velvet Room. Persona 5 manages to differentiate itself not only from the rest of the market, but its own franchise in a lot of standout ways."
2017,Persona 5,"Persona 5 is an amazing experience. It mixes dark and mature stories with light-hearted settings and characters, some deep game mechanics and lots of stuff that helps the player to suit more the game. In few words: one of the best JRPGs this generation."
2017,Persona 5,"Not everything is perfect, though as many of the characters and their roles too closely resemble that of how Persona 4 is set up, and managing so many relationships at once can occasionally feel like busy work."
2017,Persona 5,"One of the best role-playing games ever made, Japanese or otherwise, and beyond that simply one of the most stylishly told interactive stories you¡¦ll ever experience."
2017,Persona 5,"Persona 5 is an incredibly rich, detailed and nuanced fantasy JRPG/school-life sim that may very well take more than 100 hours to complete. A must-see for everyone except people with strongest aversion to Japanese culture. [Issue#220, p.78]"
2017,Persona 5,"Persona 5 is not nearly as subversive nor as smart as it wishes it was, but it's stylish as hell and a gripping ride. Worth the wait, and worth your time."
2017,Persona 5,"I must say, The Phantom Thieves surely stole my heart as I've had a ton of fun with Persona 5. However, a few nagging features and the fact that the dungeons could use a little more complexity means that it doesn't quite top my list of favourite JRPGs."
2017,Persona 5,"There¡¦s an excellent 50-hour game in here, but being needlessly stretched out to the three-digit mark waters down the whole experience. If it earned its size and made good use of the time, that¡¦d be one thing, but Persona 5 spends far too much time treading water. In trying to be more, Persona 5 ends up being less, and we¡¦re left with a game that¡¦s simply very good, rather than the masterpiece it deserves to be."
2017,Persona 5,"It¡¦s an easier experience with a story that¡¦s markedly simpler than past entries, but Persona 5 is still operating on a whole different level than its peers. A simplistic yet ultimately winning JRPG with loads of content."
2017,Persona 5,"Persona 5 is clearly one of the best J-RPGs of its generation with a reworked combat system that adds a lot of rhythm, and the whole side of the student life at the academy. The only drawback is the dated visuals."
2017,Persona 5,"As someone who has spent a lot of time with the Switch recently, and who loved the hell out of the Vita during that year or two it was getting regular games released on it, I really did find myself at times wishing this game had some kind of portable version. It just felt like the social life aspects of the game might have been more at home when I experienced them on the Vita in P4G...Still, the fact that¡¦s my biggest complaint in 120 hours of JRPG says a lot. I was damn impressed by Persona 5, and will certainly be returning to it once I¡¦ve had a few months to decompress from this super concise playthrough. I played 120 hours in just a couple of weeks and damn it was a lot of fun."
2017,Persona 5,"Persona 5 is a fantastic journey to embark on, full of well-realized characters, serviceable if a little archaic level design, and more than enough activities and distractions to keep you pushing through until its conclusion."
2017,Persona 5,"The focus on the rebellious, non-conformist side of youth has its drawbacks, but means Persona 5 is something to which its predecessors could never lay claim. It is, simply put, cool. Everything, from the intro movie's disco house to the battle-mode cutaways and even the basic UI, is achingly, confidently stylish. Criminally, the DualShock 4's Share button functionality is blocked for the duration, but this is one of few true blemishes on a game that, while at times a bit too familiar, never comes close to breeding contempt. [May 2017, p.110]"
2017,Persona 5,"The game¡¦s core message feels weak at times, but Persona 5 more than makes up for that with its style, and by showing players a damn good time. Is it the best Persona game we¡¦ve seen yet? Not quite, but it sure is the best-looking one to date."
2017,Persona 5,"Persona 5 is periodically fascinating, but it¡¦s unable to maintain the required level of interest and energy over such an extended running time. If it were half as long and cut out most of the repetition, it¡¦d be a much tighter, more enjoyable experience. As it stands, adventuring with the Phantom Thieves sags way too often to be a heartfelt recommendation."
2017,PUBG,"The enormity of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds' success will have surprised even its developers. This is a shooter that didn't invent the Battle Royale genre in gaming, but which certainly perfected it to the point that it found a massive, massive audience. With more than 30 million copies sold, PUBG is a bona fide phenomenon with an influence that will be felt in the industry for years to come."
2017,PUBG,"PlayerUnknown¡¦s Battlegrounds is one of the most compelling video game experiences to come out in years. That its stood out in a year filled with some of the best games ever is a testament to how brilliant it really is. It¡¦s the sort of game I talk about in excited, quick bursts with friends, the kind I think about when I¡¦m not playing it."
2017,PUBG,"Battlegrounds is the refinement of a new language of play, but what may earn it a spot in the video game canon is that conceptual efficiency. It isn¡¦t accessible for every player, but it¡¦s understandable. Anybody can easily learn to read this game, to watch it, to spot the tension and excitement and drama...[An] imperfectly perfect game."
2017,PUBG,"The fact that PlayerUnknown¡¦s Battlegrounds impacted the industry in such an important way, even with its many flaws, is a testament to the strength of its game design. It¡¦s a brilliant multiplayer shooter, a game that¡¦s incredibly fun to play and almost as fun to watch."
2017,PUBG,"PlayerUnknown¡¦s Battlegrounds has taken the military-sim gameplay popularized by games like ARMA and DayZ, boiled it down to its most exciting parts, and streamlined it into quick and accessible rounds of pure, hassle-free, survival-based action. Even though each game starts the same way, its remarkable ability to feel like a new, tense adventure each and every round has kept me coming back for hours on end."
2017,PUBG,"PlayerUnknown¡¦s Battlegrounds is the most immersive, intense, adrenaline-pumping, winner-take-all shooter of its time. Ushering forth a new era of Battle Royale gameplay, its technical qualms are the only thing standing in the way of the path to near perfection in its gunplay and survival-first gameplay."
2017,PUBG,"PlayerUnknowns Battlegrounds is the new standard for the Battle Royale genre. It is not a polished game, but that does not really matter when you consider how much fun you are going to have with it."
2017,PUBG,"PlayerUnknown¡¦s Battlegrounds brings the battle royale genre to a smashing mainstream success, packed with memorable moments and action-packed adventures. Solo or with friends, you¡¦re in for an intense ride that¡¦s different every single time."
2017,PUBG,"The whole madness around PUBG is well-deserved. This is the best possible praise for this great battle-royale-genre shooter. What a pity there are so many bugs, mad vehicle physics and occasional cheaters, but it bothers you only for a while. When you frantically get into the hectic, slightly frightening struggle for life and death you¡¦ll forget anything else."
2017,PUBG,"PUBG¡¦s version 1.0 not only brings a new map, but primarily introduces numerous crucial gameplay improvements to a game which was already hard to resist. [02/2018, p.28]"
2017,PUBG,"PUBG lives up to its monstrously large reputation. [Issue#197, p.74]"
2017,PUBG,"A revelatory combination of the online PvP survival and competitive shooter genres, well deserving of being labelled as a phenomenon. As an added bonus, you don¡¦t have to be pro gamer to enjoy some level of success online."
2017,PUBG,"What it does have is something an Activision or EA would kill for: a game built up around one good idea that drew in a community of unprecedented size. And that counts for a lot against PUBG's flaws: its rough-edged movement, animations, collision detection, character customisation, spectator functionality, and presentation. Perhaps you might hear all that and think this isn't worth your time. To do so would be to miss out on an absolute, and absolutely deserving, phenomenon. [March 2018, p.106]"
2017,PUBG,"Intense, rough around the edges, and brilliant. Don't fear its popularity: embrace it, and enjoy. [Feb 2018, p.68]"
2017,PUBG,"If it continues with the work done so far, and if we trust the promises that come to us from those responsible, the battlefields of PlayerUnknown can become, without a doubt, the most important games and records of this decade."
2017,PUBG,A unique and exciting multiplayer experience in which every run is different from the next.
2017,PUBG,"PlayerUnknown¡¦s Battlegrounds is without a doubt one of the best and most inventive multiplayer shooters of all time, and its persistent flaws have done nothing to detract from that, or its popularity. Perhaps it is not the first of its kind, but it is the purest distillation of what battle royale games are about: self-preservation by any means. And that, as 26 million people have now discovered, is endlessly appealing."
2017,PUBG,"PUBG is one of the best multiplayer experiences of the generation, and this is the best version of it so far ¡V even if it¡¦s still a work in progress."
2017,PUBG,"One of the most influential multiplayer games of the decade. Addictive and accessible, turns the battle royale concept into a trend in the videogame industry. Two huge maps, more than 30 weapons, 99 losers and only one winner."
2017,PUBG,"Along with the publishing of the 1.0 version, we also get a new desert map, a very practical playback function and many other updates. The completion of PUBG is now better than ever. However, the connection quality is still bad at times, and the cheaters are still everywhere in this game. PUBG has a long distance to go before it can be praised as perfect."
2017,PUBG,"PUBG takes the tradition of big-map survival games like DayZ and compresses it into digestible, 3-to-30-minute sprints that are reliably scary and low-key."
2017,PUBG,"Despite having some bugs, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds offers a truly unique and diverse gaming experience."
2017,PUBG,"PUBG is exactly what the hype says. Its exciting, its filled with explosions and the easy rules make you come back for more. Too bad it is so buggy."
2017,PUBG,"PUBG has managed to create experiences you can't find anywhere else (or at least, you couldn't). It needs to improve some aspects and polish some things to become a legend, but the foundations are already very, very good."
2017,PUBG,"Some technical hiccups aside, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds can provide some of the most intense and exciting moments multiplayer gaming has to offer thanks to a clever game mode that supports varied play-styles, and provides a unique self-contained adventure every round."
2017,PUBG,"What really makes PlayerUnknown¡¦s Battlegrounds work is the fact that anyone can jump in and walk away with stories to tell. There are so many different ways to approach the game, and in every round, you¡¦re starting on a level playing field where all that separates players are skill and experience. Having a committed friend or two can offer memorable moments to bond over and alleviate some of the more mundane periods. For players looking for more immediate engagement the deliberate pace of each match might be a turn off. Despite a simple premise and only two maps, PlayerUnknown¡¦s Battlegrounds manages to be unpredictable every time you jump out of that cargo plane, for better or worse."
2017,PUBG,"PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds is not a perfect game, but there is a good reason why it has become one of the most popular, and discussed titles of 2017. A great synthesis of mechanics, map design, and emergent gameplay, as well as a successful reiteration of the groundwork built by previous games, mean that PUBG is a fantastic experience, when it's working as intended."
2017,PUBG,"This game is a phenomenon. Not only because of its success. But rather that this Battle Royale is so fascinating even though it has significant flaws. It is the situational suspense, the half hour of sizzling tension that makes players come back again and again."
2017,PUBG,"For the time being, Playerunknown's Battlegrounds won - pun intended - the battle royale of battle royales. This new ""gold rush"" spawned a good number of decent titles, but the one created by Brendan Greene if by far the best and funniest to play (even if there's still room for improvement)."
2017,PUBG,"The Battle Royale game mode is so compelling, with each loss only making you want to do better next time, and each victory giving you stories of tense games of cat and mouse and frantic gunfights. It¡¦s still lacking in terms of polish and optimisation, but after years of experimentation, this feels like the real start of a new paradigm in multiplayer gaming."
2017,PUBG,"One thing is for sure, as we look to the future for this powerhouse of a game, the sky is the limit."
2017,PUBG,"PUBG is a like an adrenaline shot. It is surely one of the best multiplayer experiences in recent years. With its simple and highly effective principle, it has been the best Battle Royale game and one of the most fun games of 2017. And will probably be so in 2018 as well."
2017,PUBG,PUBG is pubg is the best choice if you want to experience the feeling of being the last man standing.
2017,PUBG,"Whether you play solo or in a group, successfully executing adaptive tactics to win intense, high-stakes firefights makes for an incredibly rewarding experience. Every player has unique stories of their most memorable matches, and even after hundreds of hours, PUBG continues to inspire rousing tales of victory and defeat."
2017,PUBG,"PUBG is such a pure and fun experience that it overcomes its many flaws. There are glitches, there are crashes, there is jank. The game will probably never be fully done. But parachuting down onto that island feels new and exciting every time. A number of simple ideas comes together to make a great game and establish a great genre."
2017,PUBG,"Playerunknown's Battlegrounds is ultimately greatly entertaining, and offers adrenaline filled action of the best kind. Sure, the performance is still not perfect, and the developer need to work more on that, but seen as a whole the experience is fantastic."
2017,PUBG,"If you want to be the last man (or woman) standing and wish to play a game closely resembling Battle Royale and The Hunger Games, you'll be hard pressed to find a better game than PUBG, for now."
2017,PUBG,"Is the game a flop? Absolutely not. PUBG inspires me - even in its current state. There are only a few games in which I am so energized from the first to the last minute of a match. Playing a round with friends and then doing well leads to a fantastic feeling. Quite subjectively, PUBG is a great game. But objectively there is still a lot it's gotten wrong."
2017,PUBG,"Playerunknown's Battlegrounds is a superb example of adapting the battle royale gameplay model. This is a true phenomenon and an event of the year but it's far too soon to call it ""game of the year"". PUBG is more of a late early access - tons of things got better over time but that's only the beginning."
2017,PUBG,"In the same way that Counter-Strike¡¥s early days led to it dominating the competitive scene and Minecraft¡¥s years of beta access led to it becoming a game that defined a generation, PlayerUnknown¡¦s Battlegrounds isn¡¦t necessarily the first ¡§battle royale¡¨ game out there, but it is the one that¡¦s leading the charge on making players fight to survive, and it¡¦s thrilling in every way."
2017,PUBG,"The exit from Early Access, then, seemed a bit too hasty: without going into the merits of the number of maps available, in terms of visual cleanliness, optimization and quality of the interface there is still much to improve. In short, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds works well, but it's a modest game...But remember that between phenomena and masterpiece, there is often an abysmal difference."
2017,PUBG,"PUBG is the clear choice for the Battle Royale era. However, for players who are not satisfied with the game should wait for the future updates."
2017,PUBG,"Despite how many technical and design issues it has now, and regardless of however irrelevant it may be in a few years, PUBG is revelatory, and will always hold a special place in my heart."
2017,PUBG,"PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds did not invent the battle royale genre but is the game that exploits it better than anyone else. With 30 millions players and after becoming a phenomenon on Twich, it's one of the biggest surprises of 2017 but is still far from being considered a masterpiece."
2017,PUBG,A fun game that's lacking new ideas.
2017,PUBG,"I have faith that with such a large following (and cash flow) the PUBG team will eventually get things squared away, but for now, this game still feels like it's in early access. However, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds is an absolute blast to play and has a broad appeal that few other games can match. As long as you temper your expectations (and make sure you have a decent PC), then this is one of the top games of 2017 to check out."
