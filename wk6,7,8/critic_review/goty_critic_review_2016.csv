Year,Game,Review
2016,Doom,"There were no doubts that Doom would play fast, look stunning, or be gory; the surprise is that Doom is as relevant, smart and self-aware as it is; merging old ideas with new ones; injecting its near-flawless shooter mechanics into a campaign that¡¦s impeccably refined, hilariously dumb and fiendishly moreish."
2016,Doom,"It's hard to imagine a better Doom game in 2016 than this exhilarating, darkly witty new take on id's classic."
2016,Doom,"Intelligent, involved, and relentlessly exhilarating, now, just as in '93, the most exciting FPS around is a game called Doom."
2016,Doom,"Intelligent, fresh and endlessly enjoyable, Doom is more than a tribute to its beloved progenitor. Taken in its own right, this is the most finely crafted, technically impressive pure shooter in over a decade, proving that id Software, even after 26 years, is an adept, sophisticated game-maker. It may not create the same tectonic shift in video game culture as its ancestor, but personally, I prefer this Doom to the original. By refining, meticulously, several age-old and taken-for-granted game mechanics, Doom proves that excitement, spectacle and even narrative cohesion can exist in games seemingly composed of the basest elements."
2016,Doom,"Overall I am completely satisfied with Doom. So far it has been my favourite third party AAA game of this console generation. I can¡¦t remember being this impressed with a first person shooter since BioShock Infinite, and even then I think I prefer this one."
2016,Doom,DOOM is a masterful reboot of one of the most important and legendary franchises in the history of games; bravo to id and Bethesda.
2016,Doom,"DOOM is a stupendously good package, filled with the best first person shooter action in recent history. DOOM is back ladies and gentlemen, and it is metal as all hell."
2016,Doom,"Doom is the best possible way to play, in 2016, something that was great in 1993. Unmissable."
2016,Doom,"Exactly the right amount of old and new, DOOM is an adrenaline rush that borders on overwhelming in the best possible way."
2016,Doom,"Doom's shimmering, bombastic combat is as absorbing as it is revelatory. [Aug 2016, p.100]"
2016,Doom,"An important, palate-cleansing release in a crowded genre, Doom is essential playing for anyone who registers as a shooter fan. Heed the call of the FPS daddy and get your ass to Mars, pronto.[July 2016, p.78]"
2016,Doom,"DOOM is the incarnation of classical and vintage FPS gameplay with some really interesting twists that convey even more substance and flavor to the game. DOOM has an uncompromised technical performance and a high replayability value plus a frantic. It¡¦s unfortunate that the old school multiplayer included feels like a lost opportunity. Nevertheless, the whole package pulses with energy and adrenaline. Try it on the higher difficulty settings and feel the wrath of Hell."
2016,Doom,"Despite a troubled development, Doom is a confident, cracking throwback that pays loving tribute to its much-vaunted forefathers while bringing the noise via cutting edge tech. In a world awash with sci-fi hitscan shooters, it's a breath of fiery air that will delight as it melts faces."
2016,Doom,Doom is back on next-gen consoles and it's definitely a worthy reboot in every sense!
2016,Doom,DOOM is hands-down one of the best reimagined and exciting FPS games this generation.
2016,Doom,"DOOM may become repetitious near the end and doesn't take needed risks with mission variety, but it boasts some of the finest shooting mechanics and thoughtful levels we've seen in a first-person shooter in years, pushing it to the very fringes of excellence. The campaign's a head-banging, heavy metal hoot with a surprisingly good backstory, striking visuals, and two decent multiplayer-minded modes to back it up."
2016,Doom,"A confident resurgence of one of the FPS genre¡¦s pioneering efforts; DOOM not only manages to boast perhaps the finest single-player campaign in the genre but also a blissfully entertaining multiplayer suite and map editor to boot. Make no mistake, this is DOOM 2.0 and it¡¦s one of the very best shooters you can buy on PS4 right now."
2016,Doom,"After so many years, we finally have a new DOOM and it truly feels like a classic game with it's frenetic and addictive gameplay combat. Prepare to fight thousands of demons in planet Mars and hell like the old times. Fantastic accomplishment for id Sofwtare and Bethesda once again."
2016,Doom,It may not be genre-defining like its progenitor but it¡¦s easily the best shooter on the current crop of consoles and one of the finest first person shooters of recent years.
2016,Doom,"id Software teaches us a lesson on how to make a great FPS campaign looking at the roots of the genre but making it new and fresh with spectacular graphics at 1080p and 60fps and the new executions system. The multiplayer is bad, as you should probably have imagined, but Snapmap, the level editor, is absolutely great and will be providing great moments for months to come."
2016,Doom,"With Doom, id has delivered a highly polished, utterly shameless Hellbound hecatomb that confidently swaggers into the world with gaudy fervor. It¡¦s huge, it¡¦s preposterous, and it¡¦s absolutely bloody majestic."
2016,Doom,"DOOM is unrepentantly old school. It¡¦s gore porn to the max, a ballet of bullets and blood that I can¡¦t get enough of. Satisfyingly brutal, solid and most importantly, fun."
2016,Doom,"id Software has taken its original, no-BS Doom formula and very successfully repackaged it for the modern era. The result is a thrash metal loud, gloriously gory, blisteringly fast, and thoroughly entertaining oldschool shooter. Both the single-player and multiplayer modes are basically throwbacks to simpler times, but are wrapped up with contemporary trimmings to create a package that fans of the original Doom games should really enjoy."
2016,Doom,"If you like first person shooters, if you¡¦re an old DOOM fan, or if you just like killing demons, treat yourself to DOOM 2016."
2016,Doom,"Old school gaming strikes back again, and its hits are as powerful as they once were."
2016,Doom,"Doom reminded me that games used to just be fun. It¡¦s an polished and incredibly enjoyable game that blends old-school sensibilities with new-school quality. I appreciate a steak, but every now and again, all I want is a delicious, greasy burger. Doom is that burger."
2016,Doom,"The campaign steals the show, performing at a level the other modes can't match. The straightforward competitive multiplayer recalls the glory days of arena shooters like Quake or Unreal, largely relying on the rush of circle strafing duels to keep players engaged. The standard fare of mode varieties and cosmetics-driven progression check off the boxes of a fully featured experience, but unlike the campaign, it feels generic."
2016,Doom,"Exaggerated, violent, ruthless. Bethesda and id Software took the essence of the shooters you played in the 90s and rewrote it with a modern language. DOOM is an unstoppable FPS, with a bloodthirsty single player campaign and a solid Multiplayer, unfortunately showing some balancing problems."
2016,Doom,"I honestly think we're looking at a spring blockbuster and a truly worthy reboot of a timeless classic. DOOM isn't for everyone. The blinding speed of play, demonic symbolism, demanding controls, and hyper-violence may discourage some from jumping in. If you can handle it, though, it really is a thrill ride."
2016,Doom,"DOOM is an awesome return to form, not just for the franchise but also for the old school shooter genre. A triumph, held back only by lengthy loading times and a slight lack of depth in the single-player campaign. Not that these nitpicks matter when you're shooting demons left and right with a big grin on your face."
2016,Doom,"The multiplayer aside, the true appeal to the game remains in the single-player campaign, which is how it was and should be with a DOOM title."
2016,Doom,"Doom struggles somewhat to finish what it starts, and for a franchise that practically created what we understand as shooter multiplayer 22 years ago, its largely flavorless multiplayer is surprising. But on the whole, as a new interpretation of one of gaming's most formative, difficult to pin down cyphers, id has done a pretty great job in making something that feels familiar and fresh, and, most importantly, pretty damned fun."
2016,Doom,"Doom is a '90s game made in 2016. It's campaign is, plain and simple, lots of fun, as long as you can keep up with its innumerable battle arenas and its gameplay mechanics, based on movement, pure speed and rhythm. Its multiplayer options lack work and don't depend as much on player skills, although the SnapMap mode leverages it, thanks to its almost infinite edition and creation options. This amounts to an all-around game, especially made for players that grew up with FPS games a long time ago."
2016,Doom,It¡¦s a game with confidence in the worth of revisiting its history and an earnest belief that doing so can result in much more than an empty exercise in nostalgia.
2016,Doom,"With Doom, it¡¦s clear that id Software set out to make a shooter game which puts fun above all else, and in that regard, the studio hit the nail right on the head. Some old-school purists may scoff at a Doom game with progression and unlocks and other modern shooter elements, but if their refusal to let go of the past keeps them from playing Doom, they¡¦ll only be robbing themselves of the chance to play what is hands down one of the most solid shooter experiences of 2016 so far."
2016,Doom,"Doom is the perfect mix of the classic and the modern shooters. Fun, frenetic and wild, Doom delivers pure, old school action."
2016,Doom,Doom honors its legacy while setting the stage for a new era for the long dormant franchise. Intimately gory encounters and a surprising emphasis on story more than make up for the bland multiplayer.
2016,Doom,"Look past the lop-sided multiplayer, and Doom is still one helluva reboot. It¡¦s a must for any modern FPS fan looking to taste the ultra-violence of yesteryear. Your Nana will hate it. [August 2016, p71]"
2016,Doom,"Excellent return to the classics cannot deny its modernity at the same time. It attracts with brutality, entertains with endless action and surprises with very clever design. [Issue#264]"
2016,Doom,Doom is a fantastic single-player experience bundled with a weak multiplayer component.
2016,Doom,"By sticking to its core identity and cranking the intensity up, id has raised the bar on how I want action-oriented first-person shooters to feel, and it¡¦s going to be hard to go back to something with less adrenaline after my time with this heavy metal beast."
2016,Doom,"Doom is not the best shooter ever made, but boy did we enjoy it. Many references to the original, plus a lot of chaotic battle on locations that are simply insane. Doom is Doom, but in a modern way, and we thank id Software for that."
2016,Doom,"Kudos to id and Bethesda for managing to make an old game feel new again. That¡¦s not easy to do, and while its multiplayer stumbles, Doom will leave you exhausted from its intensity, sick from its brutality, and yearning for more when you complete its 13-hour campaign. If you like your shooters fast and deadly, Hell is pretty heavenly."
2016,Doom,"Many shooters chase the thrill Doom delivers, but few are as potent in their execution. It captures the essence of what made the classic Doom games touchstones of their day, and translates it to suit modern palates with impressively rendered hellscapes and a steady influx of tantalizing upgrades. Doom is the product of a tradition as old as shooters, and while it's not the model to follow in every case, modern shooters could learn a thing or two from Doom's honed and unadulterated identity."
2016,Doom,"Combat may become a little tedious after long stretches of play, the load times are a little lengthy, multiplayer is a smudge unbalanced, and SnapMap is a so-so addition, but the adrenaline-fueled gameplay and the ample replayability featured within the campaign makes this a standout entry in the FPS genre ¡V let alone a worthwhile resurrection of DOOM."
2016,Doom,"Id Software proved that you can use a classic road to get to present time, without destroying the charm of the original. Doom remains an old-school, dynamic shooter devoid of lengthy cut-scenes and convoluted plot. It's a hell of a ride, just like twenty years ago."
2016,Doom,"What a pleasure it is not to have to reload weapons, or to glide over health and armor pickups without pausing to press buttons, or to whip through levels so straightforward they¡¦re basically slides from one bloodbath to the next."
2016,Doom,"Despite its shortcomings in the multiplayer ¡X easily forgotten and waved off as an unnecessary add-on ¡X and the rare instances of a mechanically loose screw, DOOM is undeniably one of the best looking and sounding shooters there has been for some time."
2016,Doom,"Violent, fast and visceral, Doom finally returns to its origins. The atmosphere and gameplay undoubtedly remind us of how powerful the saga was in the 90's."
2016,Doom,"Relax ¡V this is very nearly the Doom you've always wanted but never really thought you'd get. By focusing on DOOM's brutal, ultraviolent heart iD has created an all-action FPS in the old-school style, but with next-gen looks and a handful of mod-cons. It's not going to reinvent the genre, but it might help you rediscover all the good stuff that used to make it tick."
2016,Doom,"After nearly 12 years Doom is back, and what a comeback. The action is both intensive and smooth, the combat mechanic is surprisingly deep and the graphics are fantastic. On the negative side the design starts to feel a bit repetitive towards the end, and the online mode isn¡¦t as balanced as the best games in the genre. But overall, Doom is just pure fun."
2016,Doom,"Superbly fun. While there are nods to the previous games in the series, there are times where it does not ¡§feel¡¨ like a Doom game. That does not deter from the overall experience. The game is gorgeous, sounds great, and offers reasons to come back and play. The SnapMap mode is an excellent touch, however the multiplayer feels added for the sake of having multiplayer. Doom is known for its single player experience, and that is where it excels the most."
2016,Doom,Doom is saved by its frenetic gameplay represented in the campaign and its Snapmap editor that allows you to do everything. The game would have been better without a multiplayer that deducts.
2016,Doom,"It's very hard not to like the new Doom. The game's approach to shooting is fast, frantic and incredibly well-made, with a feeling of both old and new all at once. The story is relatively long, growing steadily more repetitive the more you play, but multiplayer and SnapMap work nicely as diversions, making the overall package very likeable."
2016,Doom,"Defying the odds, id Software has made DOOM not only a relevant series in 2016, but a great one. They¡¦ve also managed to create three distinct modes that all have their own appeal and feel to them. It¡¦s an amazing package, and one that I¡¦ll continue to come back to."
2016,Doom,"The slogan 'Fight like Hell' says it all. Doom is brutal, it is quick and it is exactly what Doom was in the 90s. That is a big plus, but also a weakness as id Software simply can't manage to modernize the series. The story is insane, the tempo is odd and shooting gets a bit repetitive."
2016,Doom,"Doom in 2016 may not be quite what I had anticipated, but it has just enough old and new to make me a fan."
2016,Doom,"If you like a more-than-decent shooter and lots of blood splatters on your television screen, DOOM remains a force to be reckoned with. I just wish the game was a little more fun to play."
2016,Doom,"As graceful a marriage of old school action and modern sensibilities as you could probably hope for, despite the so-so multiplayer and repetitive setting."
2016,Doom,"Doom feels stuck out of time, a gorgeous, gruesome beauty, but only inches removed from shooter conventions 15 years past their prime."
2016,Doom,"People will be talking about the first two Doom games for decades more ¡V those two games may well be remembered as true classics of the gaming medium a century down the track. This Doom won¡¦t. This new Doom is terrible...Like the greedy organisation that unleashes hell on Mars, this is the product of exploitation; the developers at ID Software and Bethesda are playing with fire in treating a property as valuable as Doom this way."
2016,INSIDE,"By entering the world of Inside, you'll forget your own world and everything that's been going on in it. From beautiful art design to engaging gameplay, thrilling atmosphere to marvelous story, everything about this game is truly exceptional. Do not miss it."
2016,INSIDE,"It's all an experience worth savoring and enjoying throughout the brief five-hour playtime. Much like Limbo before it, Inside is a simple game, utilizing classic tried-and-true mechanics to quietly tell a strong story."
2016,INSIDE,"Playdead's Inside is one of those rare games that has to be experienced first hand in order to understand its importance. Rest assured, you'd be hard pressed to find another game that's equally brilliant and beautiful."
2016,INSIDE,"Inside is a game that has to be experienced first-hand to be understood and I¡¦d urge everyone to play it. At three to four hours it is on the short side, but thanks to the thought provoking and surprising story, tight gameplay and exceptional sound and visual design, Inside will leave a long lasting impression that will more than make it worth its price tag."
2016,INSIDE,Not only would I recommend playing this game I would put it under the category of required playing especially as it is very competitively priced for a game that has obviously had a huge amount of work put it to perfecting it.
2016,INSIDE,"Inside is a masterpiece waiting to be played and a worthy successor to Limbo that is just as thought-provoking, if not more. Playing through even one section of the game, the amount of polish and attention to detail is apparent. Not many games stick with me after the credits roll, but Inside is one of those rare few."

2016,INSIDE,"It took Playdead almost six years to put out their follow-up to Limbo, and that time certainly was put to good use. It¡¦s world is simultaneously macabre and filled with heart."
2016,INSIDE,"Much like Limbo, Inside also has a timeless quality to it and is yet another must-play experience from Playdead."
2016,INSIDE,It¡¦s a rare game that keeps you ruminating over the meaning of its background elements long after you¡¦ve finished playing it. It¡¦s also a rare game that demonstrates exactly what the medium as a whole is capable of. Do not wait: play it...Inside is absolutely astonishing.
2016,INSIDE,"Playdead could have simply made yet another 'Limbo' and it would've been great. Instead, they kept the core gameplay and went into a bold yet familiar direction with it. 'Inside' hasn't left my thoughts since I completed it, and I doubt it will any time soon. It's a fantastic game that proves what the medium can do when used correctly, and provides an experience that can't be replicated by film or literature."
2016,INSIDE,"Describing Inside is difficult, not because one can¡¦t find the words, but because it has to be seen to truly be believed."
2016,INSIDE,"It's rare that a game can be beautiful, gruesome, tense and exhilarating all at the same time, but Inside does just that. Its six years in the making really show. It might be just a sidescroller on paper, but it's so polished and well-put-together that its a showcase of Playdead's mastery. It's captivating and moving, gory and bleak but ultimately, Inside is a piece of art from the first stumbling steps to the closing credits."
2016,INSIDE,"Playdead's Inside is fiercely intelligent, exquisitely grotesque - and one of the best video games of the year."

2016,INSIDE,The prospect of not playing this game is far scarier than whatever Inside's ominous bad guys have planned for that poor little boy.
2016,INSIDE,Brings to fruition whatever Playdead¡¦s designers were scratching at six years ago...This now feels like where Limbo was headed all along. I¡¦m just grateful Playdead has been afforded the chance to bring us there.
2016,INSIDE,"Inside is one of those games that can mark you for life. Walking in the footsteps of Limbo, it builds its own identity in a beautiful way and improve the formula in absolutely everything we had already fell in love with just a few years ago."
2016,INSIDE,"Combine a highly compelling visual narrative with superb puzzles and brilliant platforming, and you have Inside, one of the most intriguing, addictive, and beautiful-looking games of this generation.

2016,INSIDE,"Inside expands on the concepts and scope of its predecessor in wildly creative ways, and it's so immaculately designed and constructed from top to bottom that it almost feels suitable for display in an art museum. This is one hell of a followup."
2016,INSIDE,"Inside very clearly builds upon what made Limbo great, and in fact builds something greater. Its unimaginable twist may leave you dumbfounded, confused, and quite possibly speechless, but it will fuel heated discussion with your friends about its meaning, its message, and its intentions."

2016,INSIDE,Playdead did it again and created a masterpiece which manages to surpass the masterpiece of Limbo in every possible way. We don¡¦t believe a higher praise could be said for their second game.
2016,INSIDE,Inside is an incredibly and thought provoking experience from start to finish and a game that I won't soon forget.
2016,INSIDE,Quotation forthcoming.
2016,INSIDE,"Inside is a game that simply has to be experienced.

2016,INSIDE,"The most haunting and affecting game of the year. [Sept 2016, p.76]"
2016,INSIDE,"Inside's quiet confidence is a maneuver invented to not only disarm the player, but also destabilize assumptions that seem inseparable from an entire class of games. Plenty of games have pulled the curtain away to thunderous applause. Only Inside has room for shock, panic, and the inconceivable notion that the nightmare isn't yet over."
2016,INSIDE,"Playdead's Inside is a strange, freaky and compelling game. With stunning visuals and a graceful control scheme, it's a perfect, small, indie game."
2016,INSIDE,"Basically, what I'm trying to say is that Inside excels in pretty much every way imaginable."
2016,INSIDE,"Inside shows that Playdead has a knack for the short but powerful puzzle-platformer. The puzzles are logical and challenging, while the story is told well without a reliance on the usual things like dialogue and cut scenes.

2016,INSIDE,"Inside is an incredible game, a compelling artistic achievement that deserves your time no matter what genre of game you normally prefer. I [wish] there was a tiny bit more to it, but between the gameplay, the animation and the atmosphere, it¡¦s enough to be a worthwhile experience, and one you won¡¦t forget for a good long time to come."
2016,INSIDE,"Inside is not for those looking for hours of fun, opting instead to channel the ¡¥games as art¡¦ mentality that has been debated into the dirt. It¡¦s a game that people will be trying to figure out the meaning to for months to come."
2016,INSIDE,"As phenomenal of an experience as Limbo was, Playdead somehow managed to top it with Inside. It¡¦s a hauntingly beautiful game, especially for how violent and dark it turns by the end.

2016,INSIDE,"Inside builds on every strength of Playdead¡¦s Limbo, while also delivering a compelling yet haunting world filled with smart puzzles and inventive mechanics."
2016,INSIDE,A minimalistic yet excellent puzzle-platformer that achieves everything that it attempts almost perfectly. Only its slower pace and the lack of a real challenge could be improved.

2016,INSIDE,"INSIDE is a top quality product that will let you enjoy a great journey, as amazing as overwhelming, where the excellent visual language drawn by Playdead is the key feature making the story absolutely special.

2016,INSIDE,"Ultimately, if you enjoy dark games with a healthy dose of problem-solving and/or you enjoyed Limbo, then you¡¦ll definitely enjoy Inside as well!"
2016,INSIDE,Inside is the perfect evolution of Limbo. An unforgettable journey worth your time.
2016,INSIDE,"Its vividly depressing, yet wondrous world proves that Playdead is still the master of atmospheric side-scrolling platformers, and it quickly became one of the best games I¡¦ve played this year."
2016,INSIDE,"Inside recounts the journey of a young boy in a dark, mysterious and aesthetically significant gaming world. It¡¦s an excellent puzzle platformer, able to convey emotions like fear and doubt, and it stimulates the player¡¦s observation."
2016,INSIDE,"Set an evening aside where you immerse yourself in this living painting, and enjoy every single detail."
2016,INSIDE,"While it doesn't stray far from the template Limbo set, Inside is a gorgeous, beautifully directed puzzle platformer that you'll want to see through to the end."
2016,INSIDE,"Fun, easy, creepy, scary, bizarre, and oozing with atmosphere, but doesn¡¦t quite stick the landing."
2016,INSIDE,"Inside is short but immensely interesting, telling its story almost like a silent movie, without words. Playday has once again managed to create something unique, a game that stays with us for hours after finishing the story."
2016,INSIDE,"Inside is an easy recommendation if you loved Limbo, but the abrupt ending is a bit of a bummer."
2016,INSIDE,"Visually though this is one of the most impressive games of the year, with the subtle animation and sparing use of colour telling you all you need to know about the situation without a word of dialogue. Inside isn¡¦t a fun video game, but it is a clever and intelligent one. And despite how long it¡¦s been since Limbo it¡¦s telling that nobody has managed to perfect that formula as well as Playdead."
2016,INSIDE,"Playdead has greatly improved how it delivers a story, but hasn¡¦t moved away from ambiguity. The latter three-quarters of Inside cheapens the otherwise refined package, only saved because the studio is the undisputed master of horrific puzzles. Ending aside, it¡¦s definitely worth a look."
2016,INSIDE,"Compared to Limbo, Inside does not propose any innovations and does not evolve the gameplay in any way. The new Playdead game, however, is a fascinating adventure to play, with bated breath, from start to finish thanks to the wonderful setting full of mystery."
2016,INSIDE,"This is a beautiful, haunting, and memorable game, a worthy follow-up to Limbo. Its puzzles, although rarely difficult, are engaging complements to the story. The real achievement of this game, though, is the way that it crafts its narrative: detailed environments convey the bizarre world that you travel through; introspective moments are filled with minimalist sound design and just the barest touches of music; and the things you must do to complete your journey force you to confront the realities of humanity, freedom, and existence."
2016,INSIDE,"A great game from start to finish. Fans of indie titles, moody atmosphere, and/or puzzle platformers should grab Inside ASAP."
2016,INSIDE,"At some point you get the feeling Playdead maybe didn¡¦t know how to solve their own mystery and the game wraps up in a messy, unusual and unsatisfying way."
2016,INSIDE,"Inside, from the makers of Limbo, is just like its predecessor - truly amazing to explore. The beautiful atmosphere and the intriguing themes are interesting, even though the game is fairly short and does not succeed in being very challenging."
2016,Titanfall 2,The best way to describe the gameplay in Titanfall 2 is fluid and precise.
2016,Titanfall 2,"While its contemporaries focus on new ways with which to shock and excite on screen, Respawn makes the simple act of playing feel superlative. Its multiplayer is bigger and better, with the necessary depth and momentum to take it beyond these first few months after release, while its short but exciting single-player mode has the craft of some of the best campaigns of the last decade."
2016,Titanfall 2,"It¡¦s a better, and fuller version of the original game to me, and ideally we¡¦ll see developer Respawn get another chance to expand upon the series in the near future."
2016,Titanfall 2,"By adding a truly surprising and impeccably designed single-player campaign that is consistently fun to play, as a package Titanfall 2 is the most pure, minute-to-minute fun I¡¦ve had with any game this year."
2016,Titanfall 2,"Titanfall 2 might not fix every issue you had with the previous game (and depending on your tastes, it might introduce one or two new ones), but it's a bigger, bolder game that takes a few chances and comes out better and more distinctive for it. On top of all that, it simply feels great."
2016,Titanfall 2,"Everything that makes a shooter fun - mobility, action, and a sense of empowerment - has been perfected here, and we're already waiting to see what Respawn does next."
2016,Titanfall 2,"A frenetic, enthralling, and inventive shooter in both single and multiplayer, Titanfall 2 is a spectacular beast of a game that is deserving of a place among the greats of this generation."
2016,Titanfall 2,"Titanfall 2 is everything Titanfall should have been ¡V storified, robust, and sufficiently multiplatform. The real series starts here, and I¡¦m surprised at how nothing at all feels phoned in or tacked-on."
2016,Titanfall 2,"In an era where it feels like the majority of shooters either have single-player or multiplayer tacked on, Titanfall 2 is the full package. The top-tier campaign has nearly perfect pacing, and the subtle revisions and additions to the multiplayer make it better than ever. For first-person shooter fans, Titanfall 2 is a must play."
2016,Titanfall 2,Titanfall stands out as an example of how there is still plenty of room for innovation and newness in a crowded genre space. It's superbly executed and incredibly fun to play.
2016,Titanfall 2,"With a single player campaign that subverts expectations at every corner, a movement system that can only be described as heavenly and a robust selection of multiplayer modes with more free content to come in the future, Titanfall 2 is one of the year¡¦s biggest surprises and is a must-buy for any serious shooter fan."
2016,Titanfall 2,"Titanfall 2 is everything that Titanfall should have been. It contains a wonderfully endearing campaign mode that contains some unique and fun gameplay design, while satisfying the multiplayer experience with a bevy of modes and customization options. This certainly feels like a complete game."
2016,Titanfall 2,"Far from the footnote it could have been, Titanfall 2 is a huge, headline shock. In a standout year for the shooter, this interstellar adventure dares to go big and beyond the familiar. What it finds out on the frontier is worth seeing. [January 2016, p74]"
2016,Titanfall 2,"The core Titanfall moveset is a joy, and it has been thoughtfully expanded with a delightful grappling hook. [Jan 2017, p.112]"
2016,Titanfall 2,"Ace online action combines with a truly rollicking campaign in one of the year's shootiest surprises. [Christmas 2016, p.66]"
2016,Titanfall 2,"Respawn could have settled for big dumb fun, but Titanfall 2's eclectic, standout campaign and honed multiplayer make for a smart and unusual shooter. A total rush from beginning to end. [Christmas 2016, p.84]"
2016,Titanfall 2,"Titanfall 2 succeeds in being both accessible and fun, which is a nice change of pace in the modern era of shooters. It isn't the most complicated of shooters, nor is it the most refined. However, it very well may be the most fun, which is the most important thing to a gamer."
2016,Titanfall 2,"Even if you never touch the multiplayer side of Titanfall 2, the game is worth the price of admission for its creative and continually engaging single player experience. Challenging, puzzling, surprising, funny, and above all, satisfying, the campaign elevates Titanfall 2 to one of the best shooters of the year. Pair that stellar accomplishment with an equally full-featured competitive suite, and the result is the definition of ¡§must buy.¡¨"
2016,Titanfall 2,"Titanfall 2 improves on the original in almost every way, it takes the frantic action and amps it up even more in both the multiplayer and the brilliant new single player mode. Couple this with the consumer friendly DLC approach, excellent visuals and creativity and you have one fine game. Respawn have outdone themselves."
2016,Titanfall 2,What Titanfall 2 boils down to is the kind of experience that you are looking for. I already had somewhat of a salty opinion from what I had seen of the first game although I also had no idea what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised and was blown away within the first hour of playing. Each day I went to work I couldn't wait to come home and play more.
2016,Titanfall 2,"Titanfall 2 rises to the challenge of building something worthwhile on its predecessor¡¦s foundation, and it¡¦s fresh, fun and full of surprises. Happy endings aren¡¦t always common in boy-and-his-¡¦bot stories, but here¡¦s hoping these mechanical marvels will stick around for a good, long time."
2016,Titanfall 2,"Titanfall 2 is better than the first game in almost every aspect. Campaign connects us with the world, and multiplayer is improved thanks to more varied Titans and maps. Respect for Respawn: for listening to the consumers and providing almost a perfect sequel."
2016,Titanfall 2,"Titanfall 2 is what the first-person genre so desperately needed: an injection of originality. The divine single player campaign is something truly special, and we won't be forgetting any of its standout moments in a hurry. Couple this with a deep multiplayer serving that offers a variety of modes and unique gameplay mechanics and you've got one of the best FPS games of the generation so far."
2016,Titanfall 2,"Titanfall 2 is easily some of the most fun you'll have this year, both online and off."
2016,Titanfall 2,"With its thrilling multiplayer now backed up by a surprisingly excellent single-player campaign, Titanfall 2 is every bit the sequel I'd been hoping for."
2016,Titanfall 2,"It¡¦s not a perfect game by any definition, but what game is? It¡¦s also not a game that will convert random people into first person shooter fans. What you will find in this game is a series of shooting and platforming set pieces that will make you think, ¡§Wow! I just did that? I am awesome, all hail me!¡¨"
2016,Titanfall 2,"Titanfall 2 is a far more ¡§complete¡¨ package then that the first game was, offering one of the best single player campaigns in first person shooter, and a robust and cleverly nuanced multiplayer. It's everything the first game should have been."
2016,Titanfall 2,"Respawn Entertainment managed to take the foundation of the first Titanfall and craft a great campaign along with an improved multiplayer experience, making the sequel a fantastic game that any FPS fan should check out."
2016,Titanfall 2,"It¡¦s rare that a sequel evolves on every part of the original concept so consistently for the better, but Titanfall 2 is that exception. Its feelgood movement is the foundation for both the engaging action and platforming gameplay of its strong campaign and its over-the-top competitive multiplayer. With bolstered progression, customization, variety, and a fleshed-out story, Respawn has made good on its original vision with Titanfall 2. And bottom line, it¡¦s just damn fun to play."
2016,Titanfall 2,"Titanfall 2 is to be respected for accomplishing all its objectives. Quantity in games is nice, but Titanfall 2 proves that quality is often preferable."
2016,Titanfall 2,"One of the best first person shooters of the generation, with significant improvements in depth and longevity ¡V and even a half decent story mode."
2016,Titanfall 2,"TITANFALL 2 improves most of the original game with great single player campaign, new titans, weapons and perks for it's frantic multiplayer that adds some interesting new modes. Fluid, speedy shooter (little less than first game) and more balanced experience."
2016,Titanfall 2,Titanfall 2 improves every multiplayer aspect of its previous installment and features a short but intense single player campaign. This game is a revolution in the first person shooter genre.
2016,Titanfall 2,"Titanfall 2 is undoubtedly a shining example of brilliant game design. The campaign is short, but it's also perfectly paced and full of surprising moments, while the multiplayer changes make the experience way more varied when you compare it to the predecessor."
2016,Titanfall 2,"This isn't just a worthy sequel to Titanfall, but one that improves upon the original while adding a superb single-player campaign. The latter combines fast-paced action, pilot acrobatics, heavyweight Titan warfare and a surprising amount of heart in one of the most enjoyable solo storylines of the year...It's a masterful piece of work."
2016,Titanfall 2,"On the one hand, you have a short, but fun single player that¡¦s more free and open than most FPS campaign, and on the other, a multiplayer that¡¦s an iterative improvement on an already fantastic game. In other words, Titanfall 2 is as exhilarating and refreshing now as the original was back in 2014."
2016,Titanfall 2,Titanfall 2 breathes new life into the concept and has solidified it as a franchise.
2016,Titanfall 2,"Intelligent, creative, and never less than thrilling, Titanfall 2 finally realises the series' true potential with verve and polish."
2016,Titanfall 2,"Titanfall 2 demonstrates a vitality that its predecessor couldn't. Whereas the first Titanfall kept up its breakneck pace throughout the entirety of every match, Titanfall 2 understands that sometimes, dialing things back for a few moments can make the long run much more enjoyable. In many ways, Titanfall 2 feels like the game Respawn should have made in 2013. It's a fantastic sequel. It's a fluid shooter. It's a spectacular game."
2016,Titanfall 2,"Titanfall 2 is the new king of the FPS hill. Controls are tight, action is fierce, maps are intricately designed, and Titans are badass. The cherry on top is a campaign that is genuinely enjoyable, and one that fans of the first game are likely to be satisfied with, which expands upon the universe of the series. Group all of this together with an ambitious free DLC plan, and the choice of which shooter to buy this holiday season becomes obvious. Titanfall 2 is second to none."
2016,Titanfall 2,Respawn Entertainment did just that with Titanfall 2; they turned the ideas and mechanics from the first game into an even better experience.
2016,Titanfall 2,"Titanfall 2 takes the first spot in the frantic, close-quarter scenario shooters. Respawn Entertainment has put a lot of effort in this game, clearly aiming to take the spot of the Call of Duty franchise, whose last entry will be on stores in a few days. An amazing campaign and an entertaining multiplayer."
2016,Titanfall 2,"Titanfall 2 is an excellent shooter from many points of view. It offers a good amount of contents and a solid multiplayer. It is a direct evolution of what we saw in the first chapter, but with several improvements to make it even more attractive."
2016,Titanfall 2,"Titanfall 2 is both a triumph and a mild disappointment, providing an exceptionally well-crafted singleplayer campaign alongside robust multiplayer that doesn¡¦t quite hit the heights of its groundbreaking predecessor despite some great additions to the formula ¡V the Legion Titan¡¦s minigun is undoubtedly a thing of wonder. Despite my feeling that the multi has lost a few tricks, it remains pretty much best-in-class, and newcomers to the series will undoubtedly be blown away."
2016,Titanfall 2,"The story lacks depth, but the connection between the player and his Titan is worth the journey. The multiplayer, however, is almost worth the price tag on its own."
2016,Titanfall 2,Titanfall 2 is the product of a developer that took to heart all the criticism that was thrown at the original.
2016,Titanfall 2,"There isn¡¦t a shooter on the market that can compare with Titanfall 2 when it comes to imagination, inventiveness, and flat out spectacle."
2016,Titanfall 2,"All in all, Titanfall 2 is a well-made and enjoyable shooter that should be a good buy for any shooter fans. The main campaign is fun to play through, and it makes good use of gameplay mechanics. The multiplayer is fast, frantic and exciting, and it has enough variety that people will repeatedly come back to blast apart pilots and Titans. For PlayStation owners, this is the first chance to try out Titanfall's high-mobility gameplay, but even fans coming over from the Xbox One should enjoy the improvements."
2016,Titanfall 2,"Titanfall 2 is likely pretty close to the game the original Titanfall would have been if we lived in a perfect world where deadlines did not exist and developers didn¡¦t need to put a product on shelves in a timely fashion in order to stay in business and feed their families. It¡¦s a complete package, it¡¦s polished and pretty, and it¡¦s super fun."
2016,Titanfall 2,"With Titanfall 2, Respawn is offering a fresh and new FPS, with a solid Campaign mode. Multiplayer is still very good but with some gameplay simplifications is not the total evolution we expected."
2016,Titanfall 2,"Titanfall 2 improves the breed mainly by adding a true solo campaign mode which was really lacking in the first game. The multiplayer doesn't evolve much, but overall the game offers strong content for gamers."
2016,Titanfall 2,"First two hours of campaign are surprisingly boring, since beautiful Typhon nature quickly gets replaced with dull industrial zones. But when it looks like Respawn has once again screwed up singleplayer, Titanfall 2 suddenly picks up the pace and starts delivering one interesting setpiece after another. [Issue#214, p.48]"
2016,Titanfall 2,"Titanfall 2 is designed just well enough, and with enough layers so to not be entirely derivative. Hero simulations are so vastly abundant in this industry - so if you¡¦re going to play one, you might as well choose from those who do it the best."
2016,Titanfall 2,The surprisingly good -albeit short- campaign along with a well balanced multiplayer mode offers a great game that should not be lost from your radar during this ¡§FPS packed¡¨ season of the year.
2016,Titanfall 2,"There's a few games that compete with Titanfall 2 as a vehicle for multiplayer chaos, but there's nothing out there like its single-player campaign."
2016,Titanfall 2,"Titanfall 2 shines when it is, as Alavi says, doing things that other shooters do not. Whether it is in the surprising invention of its campaign, or the busy ebb and flow of its multiplayer modes, this is a shooter that should not be overlooked."
2016,Titanfall 2,"Though its single-player campaign is a little lackluster when it comes to story, it does a good enough job at providing some context to the chaos of the online component, and the mix of platforming and shooting stopped the experience from getting too repetitive. In terms of multiplayer, Titanfall 2 is a sequel in every sense of the word. It¡¦s bigger, better, and nips many of the issues with its predecessor in the bud."
2016,Titanfall 2,"The single-player campaign is a blast while the multiplayer is solid if only slightly underwhelming. Kudos to the developer for creating a work of fun that made me chuckle, smile, and feel good. Who knew an iron giant, accompanied by clever level design, would steal my heart?"
2016,Titanfall 2,"Although it's a little on the short side, and its production values are a bit oldschool, Titanfall 2's single-player campaign is a really enjoyable experience while it lasts. It's very inventive and fun, and a great warm-up for the game's excellent multiplayer component, whose gunplay and controls are absolutely outstanding. All it needs is a few more maps and modes."
2016,Titanfall 2,"This time with Titanfall 2, we have a solo campaign, and it's a good one! With the boosted multiplayer mode, the experience is now complete and all the great FPS around now have a great competitor to fight with."
2016,Titanfall 2,"The addition of a single-player campaign was a huge positive for this series, especially due to the bizarre twists and turns it takes throughout. In a year filled with outstanding shooters in both the single and multiplayer fronts, Titanfall 2 does just enough to prove it can hang with the others, even if it is re-treading old ground."
2016,Uncharted 4,"Uncharted 4 is a landmark title that anyone remotely interested in interactive storytelling should invest in. Naughty Dog has once again raised the bar across the industry. Thrilling shootouts, a staggering level of detail, breathtaking visuals and emotional depth come together to make Uncharted 4: A Thief's End a must-play masterpiece."
2016,Uncharted 4,"Not flawless, but easily the brightest jewel in the PlayStation 4 crown. Deserving of a place in your gaming museum. [July 2016, p66]"
2016,Uncharted 4,"I suppose some people are still hung up on the concept of a ""perfect score."" Of course, it doesn't mean ""perfect"" because no game is flawless. In this case, I suppose I could cite the ungodly precision of enemies with grenade launchers, or the fact that the camera can go just a tad loopy in certain parts. But I say a perfect score goes to the game that is, upon release, better than all the competition. If nothing on store shelves can compete, if you rack your brains and can't think of a better game to come along in the past year or so, it deserves the maximum score. I also believe in the subjective aspect, in that if the game didn't make an impact on a personal level, the critic shouldn't hand out the 10. I've almost never done it because clearly, my requirements are steep. But here, I can't imagine giving out anything less...Side note: Though, with 36 perfect scores counted so far according to Metacritic (more than 1/3 of all 102 counted reviews), I'm hardly the only one to come to this conclusion."
2016,Uncharted 4,"Naughty Dog's victory lap is a celebration of its past, present and future, with clever pacing and thrilling set-pieces surpassing expectations in its most exhilarating Uncharted to date. No PS4 should be without this. [June 2016, p.74]"
2016,Uncharted 4,"Uncharted 4 is a masterpiece, albeit a flawed one. Even with its problems, the level that developer Naughty Dog can attain almost puts the rest of the industry to shame."
2016,Uncharted 4,"Gameplay never ever grows stale in Uncharted 4. From beginning to terrific end, Nathan Drake's final adventure keeps you invested and focused...And when it's all over, the last thing you want it to be is the end of this franchise."
2016,Uncharted 4,"Uncharted 4 is a grand adventure: over the top yet, simultaneously, graciously restrained. It is a reflection on a grandiose life with an overcast of impermanence and a dignified maturity. A Thief's End doesn't settle for telling the final story of Nathan Drake, it also tells the human story of Nathan Drake, serving as a fitting, elegant farewell. ""Immersive"" is a word that is often used to describe well-executed games, yet never has it been more appropriate than for A Thief's End. Never have I felt more respected as a player, as a fan, than I did during my time with Uncharted 4."
2016,Uncharted 4,"The conclusion to the series is fitting, harkening back to Naughty Dog¡¦s early days while also giving us a suitable send off to the Drake¡¦s. Fitting, but still an end."
2016,Uncharted 4,"It¡¦s the kind of closure that will make you reminisce about the first time you fired up the debut Uncharted game, but you won¡¦t feel nudged to fire up Drake¡¦s Fortune immediately after completing A Thief¡¦s End."
2016,Uncharted 4,"This is the best Uncharted game to date, and quite possibly one of the best games that will come out this generation."
2016,Uncharted 4,"The beauty of Uncharted 4¡¦s larger and more varied environments is that they lend themselves well to figuring out multiple solutions to tricky enemy engagements, using a combination of stealth and brute force, so there¡¦s that kind of replayability that Naughty Dog is known for. Bumping up the difficulty to Hard or Crushing forces players to mix up their strategy since the enemies are that much more aggressive and deadly."
2016,Uncharted 4,"Having exhausted my repertoire of adjectives for describing this game I¡¦ve decided to keep it simple: Uncharted 4 is the best game in the franchise and ¡V dare I say it ¡V the best game on PS4. Whether you¡¦ve been part of the series since day one or never played any of them before, it matters not ¡V this one is absolutely worth taking the time out to sit down and enjoy."
2016,Uncharted 4,"With our video game reviews we reserve a five-star rating for games that we think everyone should experience, that are so interesting or impressive in certain areas that they transcend any flaws, limitations or genre concerns. Uncharted 4 is certainly in that category. [Official Verdict - 5stars]"
2016,Uncharted 4,"It is, without a doubt, Naughty Dog¡¦s finest moment and an experience that surpasses all the Uncharted games that preceded it."
2016,Uncharted 4,"Naughty Dog has crafted a brilliant game that can stand alone as the best game on PlayStation 4. Uncharted was once referred to as a Tomb Raider clone, but it wound up being a Tomb Raider killer. Naughty Dog has elevated the video game industry as Uncharted 4: A Thief¡¦s End is pure brilliance."
2016,Uncharted 4,"Uncharted 4 works excellently as the definitive action-adventure experience and as a deep narrative-driven game. The huge attention to small details combined with the perfect adjustments to a functional gameplay formula results in a product that shows us the thirty-year experience of Naughty Dog, one of the most valuable videogame developers out there today."
2016,Uncharted 4,"Jungle-choked ruins rise crookedly from cliff side foundations like a floating Atlantean paradise. Mist-cloaked mountains frame gobsmacking panoramas that might as well be National Geographic-inspired oil paintings. Foregrounds and backgrounds coalesce in visual pageantry that shouldn¡¦t be possible on 2016-era tech. Nothing you¡¦ve played¡Xon any platform, including PC¡Xapproaches what Uncharted 4 looks like."
2016,Uncharted 4,"It¡¦s a game with a bigger world ¡V and a bigger heart ¡V than any other Uncharted, full of love for the games that have come before it and the fans who have been on board since 2009¡¦s Uncharted: Drake¡¦s Fortune introduced us to Nate, Elena, Sully and friends."
2016,Uncharted 4,"This is one of the most fully-realized action campaigns of all time, and it sets a new bar of quality for what¡¦s possible in the genre."
2016,Uncharted 4,"Naughty Dog once again delivers the whole package. Even if the formula is almost 9 years old by now, Uncharted 4 is a superb end to a several-year journey in the best company you can imagine."
2016,Uncharted 4,Games don't get any better than this. An absolute masterpiece from Naughty Dog and a great conclusion to a great franchise.
2016,Uncharted 4,"Uncharted 4 is indeed A Thief's End, the type of bookend story to which other franchises should aspire. It's an emotional ride through some pretty dangerous places, not the least of which is the mind of a man who realizes he's at a major crossroad in life. Will this be the last time we see Nathan Drake? I don't know for sure, but you know what? I sure hope it is. Godspeed Uncharted, and thanks for all the memories."
2016,Uncharted 4,"Spectacular in terms of narrative, this game features astonishing graphics in order to create one of the best games of the current generation. A true masterpiece."
2016,Uncharted 4,"It takes great strides to outclass its previous entries because it knows there won¡¦t be another chance. From the opening moments to the credits rolling, Uncharted 4 is built from the ground up to close the curtain on the series with its most well-rounded, personal, and fine-tuned entry. With its new and polished mechanics, unrivaled technical prowess, human story, and thrilling action, nothing in Uncharted 4 is less than top tier. In saying goodbye, Uncharted soars to its highest heights, and bids farewell to an icon with a finale befitting of the history that preceded it."
2016,Uncharted 4,"Uncharted 4 is Naughty Dog's greatest masterpiece. A brilliant game, frantic and intense, with the best gameplay mechanics and a good storyline. A new benchmark for Playstation 4 in terms of visuals. Also fun despite a lack of more game modes in multiplayer."
2016,Uncharted 4,"From the tremendous environments to the incredible character work to the globetrotting story, the design of the game is second to none, setting a new bar for interactive experiences. It¡¦s true that Naughty Dog puts a lot more stock into story and character, but even then Uncharted 4 is pure, unadulterated fun."
2016,Uncharted 4,"It's the most appetising game smorgasbord we've ever had the good fortune to sample, with just the right blend of impactful storyline, cinematic cutscenes, explosive set pieces, exploration, discovery, puzzle solving and good old shootouts."
2016,Uncharted 4,"It¡¦s in a class of its own. It¡¦s the most fun I¡¦ve had with a video game since Super Mario World. It¡¦s an absolute treasure that combines action and story in a beautiful concert that I never wanted to end. It¡¦s one of the rare games that years from now I know I will remember exactly where I was when the credits rolled and I said goodbye to Nathan Drake, one of the most prolific video game characters of all time. Bravo Naughty Dog, bravo."
2016,Uncharted 4,"It is rip-roaring stuff. There is no great illusion here; any risk that may have been associated with Nathan Drake¡¦s introduction a decade ago has long gone, swept away in a tide of crowd-pleasing spectacle. But Uncharted 4¡¦s swagger makes it easy to succumb to the ride, its craftmanship, sense of adventure and willingness to open up to its players providing a potent sugar-rush of popcorn gaming pleasure."
2016,Uncharted 4,"The first three chapters of Drake¡¦s tale sought greatness, a spirit not so relevant to A Thief¡¦s End. The feeling of boundless adventure burns brighter than that of a neatly closing door, but though this is not these characters¡¦ highest caliber tale, this is the tale that rings true. Whether you find Uncharted 4¡¦s conclusion the proper one is an endless calculation of spoilers and motives. As for myself, I hope to see more of Uncharted, but if I do not, I will have witnessed an unforgettable end to a legacy."
2016,Uncharted 4,"In some ways it feels like I¡¦m playing Uncharted for the first time again, living that sense of incredulity and adventure as we join Nathan Drake and his charming half-tuck for one final adventure rooted in love and sacrifice. It¡¦s a bittersweet feeling, but they¡¦ve gone all in to make sure that A Thief¡¦s End is the Uncharted finale that the fans deserve."
2016,Uncharted 4,"Uncharted 4 is a true masterpiece that brilliantly concludes an unforgettable saga. Action is intense, and the story is deep and moving. The final and best chapter in the series."
2016,Uncharted 4,Uncharted 4: A Thief¡¦s End will be regarded in the same light as Ocarina of Time and Grand Theft Auto III as a game that pushed the industry to new heights we¡¦ve never seen before.
2016,Uncharted 4,"Uncharted 4 is the ultimate video game adventure, a visual masterpiece, and a heartfelt, triumphant conclusion for a PlayStation icon."
2016,Uncharted 4,"Uncharted 4 is more than masterful, bearing the hallmarks of a true system seller. What struck me most as an ardent fans of the series is how much it breaks away from the original blueprint yet manages to amaze on every level. Where many studios step safely from one sequel and into the next, Naughty Dog has taken a gigantic leap, proving yet again they¡¦re the best in the business."
2016,Uncharted 4,"A fitting end for one of PlayStation's most famous franchises, Uncharted 4: A Thief's End sits alongside The Last of Us at the apex of cinematic action experiences. Naughty Dog's ability to tell engaging tales is unmatched, with Nate's final chapter expertly balancing bombast against genuinely relatable themes. It won't redefine the genre quite like Uncharted 2, but the developer's boundless ambition means that this is a bigger, better, and more beautiful adventure than ever before."
2016,Uncharted 4,"In its writing, in its design, in its understanding of what makes games unique, Uncharted 4 is something to aspire to. It's a shining example. And we'll be talking about it for years to come."
2016,Uncharted 4,"I've loved this series from the beginning, but a new high bar has been set in Uncharted 4. Naughty Dog have created a truly memorable game, and one of the very best of the current generation."
2016,Uncharted 4,"Uncharted 4 : A Thief's End is arguably the game of the year 2016, and probably the best game the PS4 will spawn. With amazing graphics and a strong narrative, which sees a more grown up and mature Nathan Drake, Naughty Dog has crafted another masterpiece."
2016,Uncharted 4,"I can¡¦t say that Uncharted 4: A Thief¡¦s End is Naughty Dog¡¦s best game (that honor goes to The Last of Us, hands down), but it is the best game in the Uncharted series with probably the best and most appropriate and comfortable ending to a series. If you own a PlayStation 4, the game is a must have. If you¡¦re looking to buy a PlayStation 4, this should probably be the first game you get."
2016,Uncharted 4,"It¡¦s emotional, it¡¦s powerful but more importantly, it¡¦s probably going to be the most memorable game of the series with a theme of redemption and forgiveness!"
2016,Uncharted 4,"A Thief¡¦s End is not just the best Uncharted ever, but also the verification that Naughty Dog¡¦s kingdom is not of this world. Nathan Drake has earned the ticket to paradise with a game which is as spectacular as a movie."
2016,Uncharted 4,An epic masterpiece worth saving your gold doubloons for.
2016,Uncharted 4,"Uncharted 4's journey is gorgeous and thrilling. It's full of surprises and callbacks that fans of the series will love. It manages to pay tribute to what came before while offering a satisfying conclusion to Drake's story. If this series truly is done, Uncharted 4 ensures that it's a tale we'll never forget."
2016,Uncharted 4,"The best Indiana Jones game ever made. It looks amazing, the combat is great, it has excellent pacing, the vehicle sections are thrilling and exciting, and it leaves you feeling like you have experienced an awesome adventure. Not many games can say that of themselves."
2016,Uncharted 4,"There are only small flaws for a title that is otherwise incredible, a turning point for videogames in many respects. It's truly an adventure from start to finish, and something that every gamer should experience."
2016,Uncharted 4,"Does Uncharted 4 have flaws? Sure. From time to time, you notice some animation glitches, and in some episodes developers use artistic license in regards to laws of physics too excessively. But the magic of the game is that it makes you forget these flaws immediately."
2016,Uncharted 4,"Uncharted 4: A Thief's End is the first great gift by Naughty Dog to the PS4 users. But it's also for you, Uncharted fan, who now reads these lines after years following the exciting adventures of the ""descendant"" of Sir Francis Drake. This generation really begins with Uncharted 4, because this game is what everyone was expecting. It's technically excellent, it's what's really required for this console. The grand finale for one of the best PlayStation franchises."
2016,Uncharted 4,"Uncharted 4: A Thief's End is the best game you can experience in the action/adventure genre with its amazing storytelling, fascinating characters and entertaining gameplay mechanics. Good job Naughty Dog, good job."
2016,Uncharted 4,"Simply the best game of the current generation. Thanks, Naughty Dog."
2016,Uncharted 4,The best Uncharted game and a perfect ending to the saga of Nathan Drake. This is what a farewell should feel like. [June 2016]
2016,Uncharted 4,"If you're a fan of action adventures, you owe it to yourself to at least borrow a copy of Uncharted 4 and experience it first-hand. An epic journey like none other, fueled by an atmosphere from action movies of olden times, cheesy at moments, but with more than enough charisma to stay with you long after you complete it."
2016,Uncharted 4,"Uncharted 4: A Thief¡¦s End is the PS4¡¦s best exclusive to date, and one of the best reasons yet to own the console."
2016,Uncharted 4,"I have recently finished all previous episodes of the series and the verdict is in - A Thief's End is the best Uncharted there is. It expertly combines all the things we know and love with some nice, minor improvements and creates the perfect conclusion. It's a game that can be bought without hesitation, it's simply that good."
2016,Uncharted 4,"With its awesome mixture of climbing, shooting, exploring and puzzles, Uncharted 4 is the perfect bow for Nathan Drake¡¦s unforgivable adventures."
2016,Uncharted 4,"Hands down, Uncharted 4 is the best title ever developed by Naughty Dog, and not just because of the stunning graphics. A wonderful balance between storytelling and gameplay, even better than the previous installments, pushing the boundaries of engagement and sheer fun. There¡¦s no better way to say it: if you own a PlayStation 4, you must play this game."
2016,Uncharted 4,"A Thief End¡¦s is the best Uncharted yet, delivering a story I didn¡¦t want to end, and an adventure that concludes with a hell of a payoff. The ¡§wow¡¨ factor of the world exploding under Drake¡¦s feet has diminished in the years following Uncharted 2, but those moments are still effective, and a true showpiece of the developer¡¦s exquisite craftsmanship for world and gameplay design."
2016,Uncharted 4,"Uncharted 4 is one of the best action game ever created. The story doesn't have the same emotional impact of The Last of Us, but it bravely focuses on the characters and their relationships. On the other hand, the tension, the diversity, the pace and the aesthetic value of Nate's last adventure is something we've never experienced before."
2016,Uncharted 4,"Uncharted 4 is one of those rare games where everything has been made out of passion. The narrative is more important now and it won¡¦t be as genre-defining as Uncharted 2, but it¡¦s the biggest and most complete game in the series. If you¡¦re even just slightly interested in video games, you should try Uncharted 4."
2016,Uncharted 4,Uncharted 4 is Drake's last adventure and absolutely his best one. The game looks fantastic and plays even better. The numerous new features and multiplayer modes bring even more enjoyment. This is a must buy for every PlayStation 4 gamer.
2016,Uncharted 4,"That the interpersonal relationships aren't overshadowed by $400 million in pirate gold, or by hundreds of dead mercenaries, is a testament to the caliber of storytelling."
2016,Uncharted 4,"With Uncharted 4: A Thief's End, Naughty Dog have created their very best game and one of the best titles of this entire generation. If you own a PlayStation 4, you simply need to play it and if you don't, this is certainly a good reason to purchase the console."
2016,Uncharted 4,Uncharted 4 is an unforgettable adventure and the best chapter in the series. Broader maps and improved gunplay make the game a joy to play. And visually everything is simply stunning.
2016,Uncharted 4,"Uncharted 4 is a worthy and gorgeous end to the legendary Uncharted franchise. It¡¦s a bittersweet goodbye, but Drake¡¦s adventure couldn¡¦t have ended in any better way."
2016,Uncharted 4,"Whiteknuckle action, captivating characters, and luscious locales - the best Uncharted yet. [June 2016, p.64]"
2016,Uncharted 4,"We could not have wished for a better end to the series. Uncharted 4: A Thief's End offers action, humour and gorgeous graphics, combined with new gameplay elements that really feel very natural to the series. There is so much love put into the game, and it pays off: this is an excellent way to end this legendary series."
2016,Uncharted 4,It's rare that developers actually keep the promises they made at fairs and preview events. A fantastic conclusion to the series. Nathan Drake's biggest and best adventure is a must-have.
2016,Uncharted 4,Visually Uncharted 4 is a benchmark for this generation. But it is so much more. Within the franchise's constraints the characters show tremendous depth while the action is varied as never before. And while not everything is perfect (too easy puzzles and AI faults come to mind) this is one gorgeous action-adventure.
2016,Uncharted 4,"Stating that the forthcoming game will be the last rendezvous with a popular, charismatic hero is a rare phenomenon. I congratulate Naughty Dog on their courage and in spite of myself keep my fingers crossed for them to stick to their decision. The farewell party they threw for Nate is simply spectacular. This is how I want to remember him, not as an old man who rubbed his joints with pain cream and then found a UFO. Uncharted 4 is a brilliant game and a breathtaking demonstration of what PS4 is capable of. [07/2016, p.56]"
2016,Uncharted 4,"This is still a game with a formula, then, but it has never been better, and there are few areas where it could be improved. [July 2016, p.104]"
2016,Uncharted 4,"Uncharted 4 is like a book that you literally swallow page by page, but at the same time you are sad to see the diminishing count of unread pages. You don_t want it to end, you know what is coming but nothing can be done. Nathan Drake's adventure ends, but it's probably the best final chapter you could wish for."
2016,Uncharted 4,"If this really is the last we see of the Uncharted series, A Thief's End will have been a remarkable and surprisingly inventive farewell. More so than either sequel before it, Uncharted 4 builds on the formula in unexpected but natural ways, while telling a story that is more mature and thoughtful than previous games, but which still retains the series' beloved blockbuster thrills. The best in the series, and another Naughty Dog classic."
2016,Uncharted 4,"Uncharted 4: A Thief's End is a strong ending to the series. It deviates slightly from the franchise's established themes and ideas in favor of something more down to Earth, but it works."
2016,Uncharted 4,Overall Uncharted 4: A Thief¡¦s End is simply one of the best games in recent years and is arguably one of the best games of this generation.
2016,Uncharted 4,"On the whole, however, A Thief's End is a more than satisfying finale to the series, a lovingly designed treasure that¡¦s more than worth the rare scuffs and obstacles encountered along the way."
2016,Uncharted 4,"Throughout the twenty-two chapters and a wonderful final level that you won¡¦t want to miss, Nathan Drake¡¦s story is finally complete. Whatever a future developer chooses¡XNaughty Dog has said this is their last Uncharted¡Xthey have mighty big shoes to fill. Muddy, worn out, hilarious shoes."
2016,Uncharted 4,"Most importantly, it adds closure. There¡¦s no cheap set-up for a sneaky sequel, no cliffhanger ending. Just the door fittingly closing on a series of great ¡V if unfortunate - adventures. While I wouldn¡¦t go so far as to call Uncharted 4 the greatest game that¡¦s ever been made, it is indeed a remarkable one, and undoubtedly the best the Uncharted series has to offer."
2016,Uncharted 4,"Where Naughty Dog shines brightest, however, is in its ability to make you feel like you¡¦re discovering your way through what is essentially a linear adventure game. The path is predetermined, the outcome singular, but when you find that one handhold or fling yourself through that one open window, you own it. Uncharted 4¡¦s level design is remarkable, simultaneously holding your hand and letting it go."
2016,Uncharted 4,"Uncharted 4: A Thief's End is a fantastic game. Almost everything is a bit more polished than the earlier games, with better gameplay flow and with more possibilities for approaching situations your own way."
2016,Uncharted 4,"Uncharted 4: A Thief¡¦s End is a true work of art, and the only time the slightest apprehension may surface is when one compares it to the titanic installments that came before."
2016,Uncharted 4,"A Thief's End is an appropriate ending to the Uncharted series. It combines everything that made the previous games so popular with a long, robust and personal adventure with lots of variation."
2016,Uncharted 4,"Ultimately, I was deeply impressed by Uncharted 4, and I absolutely believe it lives up to the high bar of quality the series has set for itself, meaning all the delays were probably worth it. I think it relies entirely too much on the no-longer-innovative climbing mechanic, but there¡¦s simply no denying that this game is a visual masterpiece with likable characters in an interesting and intense story. In short, it¡¦s an Uncharted game, and once again, that can speak for itself."
2016,Uncharted 4,"Uncharted 4 undoubtedly keeps up pace with its predecessors, serving as an excellent ending for the series. A lot of action, incredible adventures, humor, and highest levels of audio and graphics in video games - Uncharted 4 has it all. It's a stellar game."
2016,Uncharted 4,"Uncharted 4: A Thief's End is the most spectacular game you will play this year, the best looking game ever and a worthy end to the adventures of Nathan Drake."
2016,Uncharted 4,"A performance of power. Naughty Dog realizes their profound technical ability, showcases a relationship between gorgeous locales and engaging level design, and executes a progressive yet agile and animated narrative. The viability of Uncharted's action¡Xsafe but nimble platforming and brisk cover-based shooting parallel to limitless coincidences and explosions¡Xcan feel out of sync with 2016, but A Thief's End is easily the best it has ever been."
2016,Uncharted 4,An incredible technical achievement but also one of the most cleverly crafted and most cinematic action games ever made.
2016,Uncharted 4,"What I can say, however, is it is the best representation of the Uncharted series we have seen to date, and you¡¦d be doing yourself a disservice if you didn¡¦t experience it firsthand."
2016,Uncharted 4,"Uncharted 4 finishes off the story of Nathan Drake in style. It's one of the best-looking games on PlayStation 4, the environments are huge, and the action set pieces are great. The pacing falters in the middle due to new vehicle sections, but once Uncharted 4 gets going, it's a great ride."
2016,Uncharted 4,"[Multiplayer is] competent, polished (I experienced a few connection problems but chalked them up to pre-launch network jitters), and reasonably entertaining. But it lacks the depth and long-term appeal of shooters that make online play their bread and butter."
2016,Uncharted 4,"We've had a few years with the PS4 now, and while I've cherished games like 'Until Dawn' and 'Bloodborne,' there has been a void when it came to the question of a must-own exclusive. Uncharted 4: A Thief's End is that game. It's not ahead of its time like its series' forebears, but the elements of story, gameplay, and visuals come together like a masterwork. For me, the final product beats the impressive previews. It's not a revolution, but it is Naughty Dog at the top of their game."
2016,Uncharted 4,"There is nothing cheap about how Naughty Dog has decided to retire this franchise ¡X no door is left open for a crass surprise sequel ¡X and there's nothing ambiguous about its resolution. Every other Uncharted game has, to varying degrees, posed a question ¡X ""can a thief be good?"" ¡X and summarily moved on without wagering a guess. In finding an answer, Uncharted 4's story soars, and presents a moving, fulfilling finale."
2016,Uncharted 4,"A remarkable achievement in blockbuster storytelling and graphical beauty. Though it¡¦s let down by a lack of imagination and some self-indulgence, especially in a third act that drags on far too long, Uncharted 4 carries on the series¡¦ proud tradition of peerless polish and style, with a great multiplayer component to boot. Most importantly, it¡¦s a gentle sendoff to the rag-tag group of characters we¡¦ve known for nine years."
2016,Uncharted 4,"Naughty Dog has done it again, creating a cinematic marvel that sets the bar for the action genre. There are a couple of off moments throughout the story and the multiplayer, while a decent component, lacks the variety other games deliver, but the thirteen hour single player campaign will blow you away. It¡¦s filled with an intriguing mystery, heart-wrenching emotional scenes, incredibly over the top set pieces, and of course the humor fans have come to love from our plucky (now older) hero and his trusty sidekicks."
2016,Uncharted 4,"One of the few PS4 exclusives that lives up to the ""Greatness Awaits"" slogan. There's a special element to games from Naughty Dog that deliver the type of single player experiences that can stand on their own, offering the perfect blend of story telling, visuals, and gameplay -- everything else I just consider a bonus."
2016,Uncharted 4,"This is a masterful piece of storytelling from Naughty Dog, packed full of wonderful and genuine character moments, great performances from the main cast and no small amount of little references for fans of both the series and developer. As a celebration of what Nathan Drake has given us over the last nine years we couldn¡¦t really have asked for too much more."
2016,Uncharted 4,"Uncharted 4: A Thief's End is simply amazing. Naughty Dog has done an incredible job with the last chapter of this epic franchise, creating a deep, emotional and entertaining experience for both the movies and video games addicted. If you have a PlayStation 4, buy this game and live a gorgeous adventure around the world."
2016,Uncharted 4,"With Uncharted 4: A Thief's End, Naughty Dog has delivered another gorgeous, action-packed and memorable epic. Although it's kept from perfection by some pacing issues and a couple of other minor quibbles, it's a jaw-dropping experience that offers a lot of bang for one's buck. As such, it's something that every PlayStation 4 owner, and self-respecting gamer, should play through at least once."
2016,Uncharted 4,"Overall, Uncharted 4 is a good game, but I can't help but be slightly disappointed in it. I wish there were more puzzles in the game, and that the puzzles that are there were more challenging."
2016,Uncharted 4,"The fourth installment is a worthy addition to the series. And yet I'm sorry to say that the gameplay isn't groundbreaking, and it almost seems like Naughty Dog was too cautions and not prepared to take any risks. It frequently feels like the series is relying too much on its own reputation."
2016,Uncharted 4,"Uncharted 4: A Thief¡¦s End is different from the others. It eschews the supernatural elements of the previous games in favor of a slower-paced, deeply personal story that¡¦s marred by some pacing issues. However, as usual, this entry pushes Sony¡¦s console to the max. Whether or not A Thief¡¦s End usurps Among Thieves¡¦ position as the best in the series is unclear; however, this is Drake¡¦s best tale."
2016,Uncharted 4,"The fourth installment of Uncharted is exactly what you were waiting for: awesome action sequences, kick-ass graphics, and, finally, a full point in the story of Nathan Drake."
2016,Uncharted 4,"Sony¡¦s premier action adventure series is showing its age from a creative standpoint, if not a technical one. Recognizable story cues and shock attempts have become bromidic, and there are moments that had me rolling my eyes as Uncharted 4 expected me to be startled by twists anticipated from miles away. As cornball as it can be, however, Uncharted 4 remains a damn classy romp with a sensitive side, and fans are undoubtedly going to adore it."
2016,Uncharted 4,"Excellent part four, which maybe repeats most of its previous tricks, but repeats them so well that you will forgive it for doing so. [Issue#254]"
2016,Uncharted 4,"It would be easy to dismiss Uncharted 4: A Thief¡¦s End as a jack of all trades and a master of none, and in terms of gameplay, that would be true. Beyond navigating the environments, nothing is truly exemplary and is mostly fine or good. Thankfully, it¡¦s so much more than that with standard bearing presentation, writing, and acting."
2016,Uncharted 4,"Uncharted 4: A Thief's End is visually stunning, and the best we've seen on console. Naughty Dog have produced a fine farewell to one of PlayStation's most beloved characters."
2016,Uncharted 4,"Uncharted 4 offers nothing profound, assured in its own way that it has nothing to prove."
2016,Uncharted 4,"It¡¦s a good conclusion for the series overall. Sure, it¡¦s a little loose at the start, and tonally it tries hard to be so serious and grown up, but once it gets all that out of its system the Uncharted-ness comes through and we get to take Nate for one last spin, ¡¥Oh Craps¡¦ and all."
2016,Uncharted 4,"As expected, Uncharted 4: A Thief¡¦s End is a spectacular action adventure, with some of the best and most impressive effects in the gaming history. At the same time it¡¦s a little too safe game and we have seen the formula before. Still: the best parts are, as always, jaw-dropping good."
2016,Uncharted 4,"In terms of giving the fans what they want, I¡¦m certain Naughty Dog has nailed every part of the brief that it was given. Uncharted 4 shows a truly masterful eye for detail and is near perfect in mechanical execution. It¡¦s also presented with cinematic brilliance. My issues with the game are less about it in isolation than it as representative to the broader AAA-blockbuster space. I am increasingly uncomfortable with the superficiality of these games, and the way that they work so hard to hide just how passive you are as a participant."
2016,Uncharted 4,"It's a confident, assured, and rather more intelligent game than it first appears, and a strong end to the series."
2016,Uncharted 4,"If I can sum up my experience and thoughts on the game at all, it¡¦s with the above metaphor. Uncharted 4: A Thief¡¦s End is an enjoyable romp, but it¡¦s essentially an interactive movie with very little player-choice over what any of that interaction is."
2016,Uncharted 4,"If Uncharted 4 played even half as good as it looked, it would be a masterpieceÿ but it doesn¡¦t. In fact, for all its splendor and all the obvious care taken towards making it look and sound as good as humanly possible, it makes one cardinal sin that¡¦s impossible to forgive¡Xit¡¦s downright boring to play. There are moments when it¡¦s easy to get swept up the visual opulence and bombast, but then the moments pass, and it¡¦s straight back to snarky comments and auto-climbing up mountainsides...But hey¡Xit sure does look nice, doesn¡¦t it?"
2016,Uncharted 4,Uncharted 4: A Thief¡¦s End feels as inevitable as it does unnecessary.
2016,Overwatch,The first Blizzard shooter excels above the current competition in all aspects. A distinctive audiovisual style and plenty of pleasant details on each step are nice additions to its precisely-tuned gameplay. [Issue#265]
2016,Overwatch,"If there is a complaint to be had it is that, currently, there is perhaps not enough to it. The four game types are a variation on two themes, the 12 maps quickly repeat, while competitive ranked play is yet to be included. But Blizzard has made all the right noises about being committed to building on Overwatch, providing new heroes, maps and gametypes for free across the game¡¦s lifespan."
2016,Overwatch,"Blizzard¡¦s take on the team-based shooter is as polished as you¡¦d expect, marrying tactical breadth with an emphasis on variety and inclusivity."
2016,Overwatch,Overwatch delivers an unprecedented amount of fun and excitement to a genre that desperately needed a shot in the arm. The charm and personality of the characters and environments only serve to enhance the game's pitch-perfect action and fine-tuned mechanics.
2016,Overwatch,"It has been a very long time since I¡¦ve felt this much passion for a game. Overwatch is a perfect storm. It¡¦s a new IP, looks gorgeous, plays phenomenally and singlehandedly rekindled my desire to play a genre of game I thought I¡¦d left behind at this point."
2016,Overwatch,"Overwatch is an amazing experience. It¡¦s fresh and consistently fun, with matches that are great in random groups, but astonishingly good when played with friends. Blizzard has taken its masterful art of polishing and perfection to the team shooter, and things will never be the same."
2016,Overwatch,"You can't help but take note of the attention to detail immediately, even during the first few seconds of booting it up and watching a random character emote on the title screen. This arena shooter (not a MOBA) looks, sounds, and feels great, with the polish of a Pixar film without feeling overly childish. That extends to every facet of the experience, from its 60 FPS frame rate (even on consoles), beautiful locations, and insanely detailed character models."
2016,Overwatch,"Just as Team Fortress 2 burst onto the scene and captivated so many with its charm, and accessible gameplay, Overwatch is poised to do the same with its sharp gameplay and likable characters. There¡¦s little doubt that the next great class-based shooter has arrived"
2016,Overwatch,"Pretty much everything about this game feels fresh and exciting: the class-based combat, the art style, the roster, the modes. It's equal parts strategic and twitchy, encouraging you to think while also rewarding skill, and its roster is a delight. Overwatch may well be the best new multiplayer shooter to come along since Modern Warfare and Team Fortress 2 took 2007 by storm. I can't wait to play more."
2016,Overwatch,"Overwatch is a fast, fun, and fresh take on the class-based shooter. Blizzard has made sure its first new IP in 17 years is polished to perfection."
2016,Overwatch,"I haven¡¦t been this addicted to an online shooter since I was kid spending every day after school capturing flags in Team Fortress Classic (well, trying to capture them, anyway). Overwatch has everything going for it. It¡¦s fun, beautiful, deep, and so far, it¡¦s never boring. You might be overwhelmed at first when you start your first match and have to pick just one of those 21 gorgeous heroes, but you¡¦ll quickly have a blast as you learn each characters¡¦ strengths."
2016,Overwatch,"To sum it up, Overwatch is absolutely deserving of the majority of the praise it¡¦s receiving. Some people will be turned away by just how much hype has surrounded the game as they have been burned by over-hyped games before, but Overwatch has objectively proven itself to be a great multiplayer shooter."
2016,Overwatch,I'm certain that Overwatch will bring dozens of hours of fun to all lovers of dynamic online shooters. Focusing on one type of gameplay and an enormous attention to detail generated an excellent game. You have to appreciate the developers' sincerity when discussing doubts and problems with the community. Blizzard has done it again. You should see for yourself why so many players have fallen under Overwatch's spell.
2016,Overwatch,"Overwatch is a punch to the face for multiplayer shooters. It mingles quick-fix, objective-based gameplay with a deep tactical core and intelligent meta, forming a game that is simply perfect in short bites and thoroughly satisfying to play for hours on end."
2016,Overwatch,"Overwatch catches you instantly due to the hurricane dynamics of matches and the amazing smoothness of the game engine. There are no problems with the network code which can give odds to Swiss watches. It is impossible to get lost in the wilds of the interface. It offers extremely convenient controls. As a result Overwatch is very easy to learn. [Issue#210, p.68]"
2016,Overwatch,"I fell in love with Team Fortress 2 because in that game, you win by being smart and considerate instead of quickly sniping off everyone you see. Overwatch improves on this concept tenfold."
2016,Overwatch,"A gaming experience that¡¦s more polished and exciting than I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing and one I¡¦ll be sure to continue to play for the foreseeable future. If not for the inclusion of microtransactions, this would have been a perfect game in my book."
2016,Overwatch,"Will it have the legs that games like Team Fortress and Counter-Strike have had? No idea, but Blizzard certainly has an impressive track record when it comes to supporting their games over time. For now, though, I can say that this is the most fun I¡¦ve had with a shooter in years, and if you¡¦ve got even a passing interest in team-based shooting, you should absolutely be playing it."
2016,Overwatch,"Overwatch is one of the most refreshing experiences in the FPS genre in recent memory. It¡¦s easy to pick up but hard to master. Seventeen years after its latest new IP, Blizzard finally has a new crown jewel."
2016,Overwatch,"This new Blizzard title feels effortless, and already feels like another addition to their list of seminal, necessary releases. It doesn¡¦t necessarily reinvent the wheel, but the way it polishes, presents, and executes is well above and beyond standards. Easily one of the most necessary multiplayer experiences of the last few years, and a shot across the bow at shooters complacent in their defined expectations: whatever you do, Overwatch does it better."
2016,Overwatch,"Overwatch does the things most video games only dream of doing. This is a fresh, joyful experience offering an incredible variety of gameplay, high ease of access, and deep potential for mastery. In a genre full of dour shootymans using realistic guns to shoot at realistic people, Overwatch polishes off the grit to reveal a game that's optimistic and eager to be explored. This is a world you'll want to stay in, bring your friends to, and keep coming back to for years to come."
2016,Overwatch,"Overwatch is an incredible achievement in multiplayer shooter design. It bobs and weaves almost perfectly between being the quick-fix adrenaline hit you might want after a long day of work, and the thoughtful, strategic multiplayer experience that becomes the center of evening-long binges with friends. It might not have the most exhaustive list of maps and modes, but it provides nearly endless opportunities for exhilarating, coordinated play. When you¡¦re at the center of it, it feels like nothing else."
2016,Overwatch,"Brilliantly designed, superbly playable. [Aug 2016]"
2016,Overwatch,"Overwatch remains one of the most compelling and experimental shooters in the world right now. Blizzard Entertainment¡¦s commitment to innovative new heroes, modes and responding to community feedback is unparalleled ¡V and a treat to watch. Like World of Warcraft, Starcraft and Diablo before it, Blizzard has crafted something that will undoubtedly be around for years to come."
2016,Overwatch,"Though the game may seem sparse on maps and modes, the exquisite art direction, over-the-top action, and emphasis on teamwork all work together to provide endless hours of exhilaration. Most significant is the large cast of characters. With recognizable heroes that play as differently as they look, Blizzard has set a new standard for shooters. Overwatch is a triumph."
2016,Overwatch,"Blizzard proved that it¡¦s still possible to do something fresh in online shooters and helped me rediscover the charms of fragging. [08/2016, p.48]"
2016,Overwatch,"The blending of genres, those perfect Moments and the beautiful pace of each game make Blizzard's new IP a must."
2016,Overwatch,"Another fine example of Blizzard polish. We can't wait to see what they have planned for the future. [Issue#252, p.49]"

2016,Overwatch,"If you are a first-person shooter fan generally, and if you enjoy team-based FPS play specifically, not at least trying Overwatch feels criminal. Blizzard always imparts a deep sense of holistic quality into its games, and Overwatch is no exception."

2016,Overwatch,"Yes, the amount of content isn't huge now, but knowing that there's much more incoming, there aren't too many flaws in Overwatch. Fun, deep, well-designed and full of possibilities, it's one of those games you have to, at least, try."
2016,Overwatch,"Overwatch is a great multiplayer game with an amazing artistic direction. Each hero truly feels special, and it is very rewarding to play with each and every one of them. It feels like the fun will never end. A solid contender for 2016's Best Video Game of the Year."
2016,Overwatch,Blizzard has perfected the RTS and now they¡¦ve laid a fantastic foundation for the FPS.
2016,Overwatch,"Blizzard has always excelled at delivering enjoyable games with beautiful presentations, and Overwatch shows that it can extend this talent to genres that it¡¦s never visited before. This might be its first shooter, but it¡¦s rich with beautiful art and has a remarkable fun factor that you would expect from only the most elite shooter-oriented developers. It¡¦s recommendable to just about anyone even if it falters when it comes to solo play. It won¡¦t be difficult to invite your friends to come join you, after all."
2016,Overwatch,"It is Overwatch¡¦s diverse group of characters that make the game shine, though. Blizzard has crafted each to stand on their own even within the same role class thanks to their weapons, abilities, and ultras. There is no mistaking one from the other thanks to supremely intelligent design from player silhouettes to character voices and sounds."
2016,Overwatch,"Whether it's a small victory, like narrowly saving an ally's life, or a pivotal ultimate that lets you obliterate the opposing team and secure the final objective, Overwatch is ripe with the kinds of memorable moments that define worthwhile multiplayer."
2016,Overwatch,"It's that intoxicating path of discovery that makes Overwatch so varied, so rewarding, and ultimately another seminal release from developer Blizzard. Overwatch is an intelligent cascade of disparate ideas, supporting one another, pouring into one another, and coiling around themselves as they flow into the brilliant shooter underneath."
2016,Overwatch,"Overwatch is the perfect game to spend an hour with and to play a couple of matches before you do something else. And then you'll come back to it, again and again."
2016,Overwatch,"In most games, frustration and annoyance are solid indicators that something isn't working. Here, they're part and parcel of competition. If I'm annoyed, someone else is having a good time. If I'm elated, someone else is raging. That can be difficult to put a score to, because it removes emotion as the guiding light of a subjective process. Here's what I can say for certain: Overwatch is a great, occasionally fantastic shooter, and filled with fresh, clever design decisions."
2016,Overwatch,"It might not really be the ¡§Multiplayer Shooter to end all Multiplayer Shooters¡¨ (not quite yet, anyway), but Blizzard¡¦s Overwatch masterfully manages to find the sweet spot between accessibility, class balance, competitive multiplayer and pure, unadulterated fun."
2016,Overwatch,"Overwatch doesn't reinvent the wheel, but mixes well-known mechanics to create one of the best games of the genre in years."
2016,Overwatch,"Quality rules over quantity. Overwatch might be a little short on the content side. But other than that, you get a well-balanced, varied and beautifully-designed online shooter with a remarkably diverse hero selection."
2016,Overwatch,"If you can forget about its dubious commercial policy (high price, a myriad of microtransactions), then Overwatch becomes a very strong game, with many characters which are very distinct from one another. All of this with the Blizzard touch that makes each of their games accessible and polished."
2016,Overwatch,"Overwatch could very well come to dominate the hero shooter genre. There's plenty of room for improvement around the edges, but the core is strong enough to make this another huge hit for Blizzard."
2016,Overwatch,"Overwatch is the new dimension of competitive play. A step forward in the genre, an hypertrophic heir to Team Fortress: each of the 21 heroes represent a class, and the concept of asymmetrical balancing is just brilliant. On the other side, the game is not that fun if you play it alone, and the absence of ranked match is unacceptable."
2016,Overwatch,"Overwatch is a fast-paced, varied, incredibly fun competitive shooter, and that's a given. There are some balancing issues, nothing that cannot be fixed in the next few weeks, but the main problem of the game Blizzard is the lack of content sufficient for the player to keep coming back."
2016,Overwatch,"There's no question that Overwatch is a masterfully designed game. The wide array of amazing, unique characters, and the original ways they interact with one another, make for a peerless teamplay experience in the shooter space. Some issues, like a dissatisfying progression system and a hostility to solo players, hinder the overall experience, but core of Overwatch remains strong throughout. It's an easy recommendation to make, so long as you've got some friends to back you up."
2016,Overwatch,Keeping with tradition Blizzard plays it safe and sound when they take on the team based shooter. Overwatch bursts with polish and its great characters are a joy to be played by both casuals and hardcores alike.
2016,Overwatch,"I mostly enjoyed my time with Overwatch as it is very easy to pick up and play. The characters are diverse and just as colourful as the levels where battles take place. As a free-to-play title, I¡¦d have no problems with the grinding and micro-transactions, but these mechanics in a feature-lite, full priced title, mar the overall experience for me. Maybe you¡¦re okay with that, but I¡¦m not. No matter how many games do it, I¡¦ll never be okay with it."
2016,Overwatch,"Overwatch is trying hard to rope in players who don¡¦t normally go for team-based shooters, and in that respect it succeeds better than any other game in its class. The exceptional treatment newcomers get makes me want to love it, but I¡¦ll need more modes and better maps if I¡¦m going to spend hundreds of hours with it as I have with similar titles."
2016,Overwatch,"The game is enjoyable, the maps and characters are expertly designed, and the controls are tight and responsive, even on PCs that are not at the bleeding edge of technology. However, it's currently priced at the same level as a top-tier, AAA title, even though it delivers a fraction of the content that you'd expect from a game at that price level."
2016,Overwatch,Blizzard has created a solid team FPS but right now it's light on content.
