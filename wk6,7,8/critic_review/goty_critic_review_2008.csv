Year,Game,Review
2008,Fallout 3,"Heck, it might just be the best console RPG of all time. It's deep, complex and tremendously addictive. From the amazing character development system to the engaging and satisfying combat, Fallout 3 has everything you could want in an RPG experience."
2008,Fallout 3,"That¡¦s the beauty of survival, and this world of fallout: It feeds on adventure and breathes in freedom, yet it dreams of order and the safety of the Vault. I can describe it, explain it, tell it in finely chosen words, but I can never make you fully understand for as long as you sit and listen. But even if I die, I do not worry. There will come a time when you will seize that lever and open that metal door, and it is then I will return. And the Wasteland will greet you, the birth of a legend."
2008,Fallout 3,"The ironically devastated world of Fallout has never been better realized than in Fallout 3, offering a vast landscape that is almost relentlessly bleak in its hopelessness. It's absorbing, immersive, paradoxically beautiful, and kind of depressing to play over long periods of time."
2008,Fallout 3,"Fallout 3 will probably end up being one of the best games of 2008 and, in it's one unique way, a worthy sequel in the Fallout series. Bethesda takes essential gameplay elements from the original Fallout games and gives these elements a new twist. The Fallout 3 gameplay is perfectly executed and Capital Wasteland offers a fantastic world in which you'll find plenty to discover, even after spending dozens of hours in this world. Gamers, hide in your bombshelter and don't resurface before you've played Fallout 3."
2008,Fallout 3,"Vast, epic, engaging, absorbing, terrifying, horrific, amusing and thoroughly brilliant. Fallout 3 is easily one of the best games ever made and one that deserves and needs to be played."
2008,Fallout 3,"A massive, enthralling achievement."
2008,Fallout 3,"The main quest is an enthralling tale that will thrust you into the battlefield of D.C., side-by-side with the Brotherhood of Steel, face to face with the illustrious DJ of Galaxy News Radio (my favorite station of the wastes), and aboard a reclaimed aircraft carrier. It¡¦s an epic journey, but when it¡¦s done, it¡¦s done. The only option after that is to start all over again with a brand new face. No complaints here."
2008,Fallout 3,"Not only will you be glued to the game right up to the end, you'll go right back and play it through again just to see what consequences different choices will produce. Fallout 3 is a technical triumph, but more importantly, it's a beautiful piece of design, exploring the well-trodden video game ground of good vs. evil better than any other game to date."
2008,Fallout 3,"Though it doesn't do anything particularly revolutionary, the level of artistry is so far beyond anything we've played recently that it almost doesn't need to. Standing uniquely in the busy Christmas schedule and indeed within 2008 as a whole, Fallout 3 is an experience to savour."
2008,Fallout 3,"By turns spectacular, exhilarating, disturbing, moving, frightening, relaxing, idling and life-consuming, Fallout 3 is one vision of the end of times that gets better with every minute. This is epic gaming and if this is what the Apocalypse is all about then you can sign me up."
2008,Fallout 3,"If you¡¦re not exploring the wasteland then you¡¦re cheating yourself out of one of the best games in years. [Christmas 2008, p.94]"
2008,Fallout 3,"After this game-experience negative points are hard to find. Sure, the radio program is not mind-blowing and the third-person-view is suboptimal. But this doesn¡¦t matter, as Fallout 3 is wonderful and even a class better than Bethesda¡¦s last title - Oblivion."
2008,Fallout 3,"This is easily one of the best RPGs ever created, a serious contender for Game of the Year awards from the gaming media, and a title with which all video game fans owe it to themselves to spend some time. It is hard to put down and will not disappoint."
2008,Fallout 3,"Perhaps the most impressive aspect of Fallout 3 is how effortlessly it combines so many gameplay mechanics, storylines, characters, expansive environments and complex in-game intricacies into one fluid package."
2008,Fallout 3,"Games this captivating do not come along often. Between its engrossing story, ginormous world, well-crafted RPG side, and white-knuckle FPS combat, Fallout 3 completely, utterly gives you your $60 worth. [Dec 2008, p.52]"
2008,Fallout 3,"Faults be damned, though; this is the kind of hugely ambitious game that doesn't come around very often, and when it does, you'd be a fool not to play it and enjoy the hell out of it and look forward to the day (next-next-gen?) when the fidelity of open-world RPGs takes another big step closer to the uncanny valley's far side."
2008,Fallout 3,"Fallout 3 almost effortlessly succeeds in its central aim of reviving a much-loved brand to appeal to the vast majority of players. It's a thrilling, all-consuming experience that will absorb you for weeks, whether you're attracted by the action, the adventure, or the role-playing, as you fall in love with the relentless excitement, incredible atmosphere, sense of place and sheer choice...Bethesda has once again delivered a game of life-affirming brilliance that will be heralded as a classic, and talked about for years to come."
2008,Fallout 3,"Yes, Fallout 3 is a lot like Oblivion (with guns!), but it's a superior game in nearly every way, as it features a more engaging storyline, impeccable presentation, and hundreds of hours of addictive gameplay. While the jury is still out on whether or not hardcore Fallout enthusiasts will accept the game as part of the storied franchise, Fallout 3 is a must-have title for most RPG fans, as well as one of the finest games of this generation."
2008,Fallout 3,"You are going to want to book a few weeks off work for this one, once you have started its very hard to put down, a enthralling story backed up with a great VATS to add spice to the fighting."
2008,Fallout 3,"If you like role playing games, buy it. If you like first person shooters, buy it. The game is just amazing in everyway and we could not have expected a better Fallout title. Bethesda has another huge galactic hit on its hands and now we need to see some downloadable content please."
2008,Fallout 3,"The presentation of the game, as a whole, is what really takes Fallout 3 and boosts it into a level high above most of the other games being released this year on the Xbox 360."
2008,Fallout 3,"Although Fallout 3 is fundamentally a role-playing game, its success lies in the way it balances -- and sometimes betters -- the approaches of other videogame masterpieces: the retro immersion of ""BioShock,"" the paranoia of ""Portal,"" the exploration of ""Oblivion"" and the seamless storytelling of ""Half-Life 2."""
2008,Fallout 3,I just can't find a good reason not to recommend Fallout 3 to any serious gamer out there.
2008,Fallout 3,"Fallout 3 masterfully creates a parallel universe for players to explore and lose dozens of hours in. No other game of this console generation comes close to offering the amount of content, freedom of choice, and level of immersion that can be found here."
2008,Fallout 3,"So what you have here with Fallout 3 is a great addition to the series, even if you are a die-hard fan of Black Isle Studios¡¦ work with the previous Fallout titles. It has some slight faults, but the quality of the rest of the package more than makes up for it all."
2008,Fallout 3,"Bethesda's apocalyptical Fallout 3 belies its own jaw-dropping desolation by delivering a near-faultless action RPG that manages to not only execute compelling first-person gameplay but also provides an influential and in-depth character evolution system that's supported by an intriguing storyline and a mind-boggling game world that screams ""Game of the Year"" at every turn."
2008,Fallout 3,"The game combines the strengths of two fine RPG series, which for Fallout 3 means compelling narrative in a post-apocalyptic setting and immersive gameplay in a huge, open-ended world. All of this just leaves one question to answer: is Fallout 3 a contender for Game of the Year? And the answer: undeniably, yes."
2008,Fallout 3,"It isn't quite perfect, but no game of this size and scope ever really will be, and ultimately nothing can prevent Fallout 3 from being one of the greatest role-playing experiences on the console to date."
2008,Fallout 3,Fallout 3 offers freedom without sacrificing a focused story. It delivers fantastic combat without forgoing a deep role-playing system. The characters you meet are engaging and oftentimes hilarious without feeling out of place in this harsh world.
2008,Fallout 3,"Fallout 3 is an experience in itself, and while it may not offer as much replay value as Oblivion, it¡¦s so much more then an ¡§Oblivion with guns¡¨."
2008,Fallout 3,"This game is massive, and as your character¡¦s stature in the Wasteland grows, so does the excitement. It¡¦s not a true sequel to the Fallout series, but as a fan of the games of old, I found it to be every bit as good."
2008,Fallout 3,"There is more gameplay in this game than any four other holiday titles combined, and every minute of it is compelling."
2008,Fallout 3,"Hardcore Fallout fans will either hate Fallout 3 because it's not Fallout or Fallout 2, or they'll love it because it's still a great game set in one of the best freaking universes ever. If you never played the original games and you like shooter/rpg combinations Fallout 3 is a must buy."
2008,Fallout 3,"This is one of the best games of this generation, and a must-have for anyone with the slightest bit of interest in the post-apocalyptic genre."
2008,Fallout 3,"Fallout 3 is among the best games I've played this year, and represents both Bethesda's legacy and the legacy of the Fallout series incredibly well. It's easy to sink hours into exploring this world, and its depth will consume you if you let it. Fallout 3 is a must buy for anyone who loves games, regardless of your preferred genre."
2008,Fallout 3,"The people at Bethesda are well-known for making games with incredible longevity and replay value, and Fallout 3 is another solid, worthy achievement by this studio ¡V you can be sure that down the road there¡¦ll be expansions or downloadable content for this already sizeable experience."
2008,Fallout 3,There's no doubt that many people already know that they will love Fallout 3: it offers the epic world that many yearn for.
2008,Fallout 3,"Definitely, no videogame fan should let Fallout 3 escape. There are so many things you can do, places you can explore and situations to experiment, that regardless the many times we could say this is a superb title, an instant classic, there is no better way to understand the reason for such praise than to get lost in the ruinous Washington D.C. region."
2008,Fallout 3,"If you can put in the time and commit to exploring this detailed and carefully designed wasteland, then Fallout 3 can't help but satisfy and engage you in ways that very few games ever have."
2008,Fallout 3,"It looks amazing, its immersion factor is second to none, and the whole experience is like a good book; addictive and impossible to put down. Packed to the gills with the incredibly deep Fallout mythos, you can play through the twenty odd hours of main quest but come back to experience the 50+ hours of side quests dotted throughout this freaky, radiated reality."
2008,Fallout 3,"In the end, Fallout 3 feels like a Fallout game, and that is absolutely the highest compliment. Despite the changes, much of the charm and fun of the franchise remains intact, and despite the similarities to Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion, I never felt that I was playing anything but a Fallout game."
2008,Fallout 3,"If the third-person perspective was better, Fallout 3 would¡¦ve been an almost perfect RPG. Even with that said, everyone needs to spend time showing off how amazing VATS is since it is pure ecstasy."
2008,Fallout 3,"Tthere¡¦s a constant flow of surprises and excellence packed into this RPG. Everything is set at such a high caliber that the negligible flaws and inconsistencies come across as much larger blemishes than in most games, but they can¡¦t tarnish the overall experience."
2008,Fallout 3,"Fallout 3 is a fantastic game. It has its flaws, as does any game, but it is so immersive and can give you a heck of a lot of entertainment for your money that it's worth the pricetag. If you liked Oblivion, you will no doubt fall in love with this game as I did. Maybe not Game Of The Year, but it is a worthy contender for that top spot."
2008,Fallout 3,"Still, it's the kind of hugely ambitious game that doesn't come around very often. [Dec 2008, p.69]"
2008,Fallout 3,"Ultimately, Bethesda triumphed over all odds with Fallout 3. Defeating hype and the need to live up to the past, the Fallout 3 team created an intensely profound world and worthy successor to the franchise."
2008,Fallout 3,"But really, those why find the missions a little repetitive are missing the point, because while Fallout 3 is certainly not perfect, the goods outweigh the bad to such a degree that the negatives really can be ignored. Whether you want to trade, rob trade caravans, become a melee combat specialist or perfect killing from 500 yards, the possibilities are endless."
2008,Fallout 3,"When people talk about deep, immersive video games, Fallout 3 can stand as a reference."
2008,Fallout 3,"Different from Oblivion but bound to be compared to it, Fallout 3 is deep, rewarding and as open-world as you get, with only a few issues that warrant a sight raise of the eyebrow."
2008,Fallout 3,"Fallout 3 is a masterpiece. Failing to add it to your games collection is simply not an option. [Christmas 2008, p.74]"
2008,Fallout 3,"In almost all respects, Fallout 3 is a staggering, genre-defining achievement - marrying an utterly immersive world, memorable characters, incredible production values, some of the most inspired RPG mechanics ever devised and so much heart. It might not steamroll the epic ""Oblivion"" in the manner we all hoped, but maybe that was simply asking too much. Instead, Fallout 3 stands as the perfect companion piece - a near unparalleled RPG that stands so far ahead of the majority of the games on 360 that it would be a crime against gaming not to laud this title as anything other than a masterpiece."
2008,Fallout 3,Bethesda has done an excellent job at creating a living and wheezing post apocalypse world. Combining RPG elements and gory action orientated combat flawlessly.
2008,Fallout 3,"If you own a next gen system, you really owe it to yourself to play this game for at least 10 hours of your life. Doing this will not only prove how entertaining games can be, but rather act as a statement as to how far video games have come."
2008,Fallout 3,There's a tremendous amount of replay value here as well so you'll really want to play it over and over again. Fallout 3 is worth the wait and it's not surprising that Bethesda has done it again.
2008,Fallout 3,"From the hollow wind blowing down through subway tunnels, to the radioactive dust clouds swirling throughout the wasteland, up to the buzzards circling the encampment where the bodies of 30 slave traders lie; Fallout 3 is as much a game as it is a training sim for the coming apocalypse."
2008,Fallout 3,"In fact, Fallout 3 is leaner and meaner than Bethesda's previous efforts, less expansive but more intense, while still offering immense replay value and quite a few thrills along the way."
2008,Fallout 3,There's no denying Fallout 3 is little more than Oblivion in a post-apocalyptic setting. However that's more a compliment than complaint.
2008,Fallout 3,"Another must-have title to make wallets weep and players rejoice, Fallout 3 live up to expectations and only seldom stumbles, even then in expected areas where scale and scope get the better of it slightly. Regardless, it¡¦s an undeniable classic and if you only plan on buying one or two games this winter, we couldn¡¦t name a title that could give you value for money in the way that Fallout manages."
2008,Fallout 3,"The overall experience of Fallout 3 is unmatched, and the amount of game Bethesda has packed into this $60 title can¡¦t be ignored. Flaws aside, taken as a whole, Fallout 3 is an astounding effort and easily one this year¡¦s best gaming experiences."
2008,Fallout 3,"Fallout 3 gives an incredibly bleak outlook on our future and humanity, all the while roping me in closer than just about any title has in the past few years, despite it¡¦s faults. It¡¦s a game everyone should play, if not just to find out who they really are, and to learn what life would be like if we finally had to duck and cover."
2008,Fallout 3,"The game concludes with a satisfying outcome, but really doesn¡¦t make much of a big deal of your course through the game and final decisions on what to do, and unless you¡¦ve got a save before the unexpected point of no return, you¡¦ll have to start again to explore more of the world. Of course that¡¦s the beauty of the game. You¡¦ll want to."
2008,Fallout 3,"Fallout is back and dare I say, better than ever."
2008,Fallout 3,Fallout 3 is a triumph in almost every sense.
2008,Fallout 3,"For all Fallout 3¡¦s ideas, innovations, and excellent hybrid of game genres, it¡¦s not without its flaws."
2008,Fallout 3,Fallout 3 is the biggest accomplishment in adventure gaming since Oblivion.
2008,Fallout 3,"A big game that is worth sinking your teeth into, even if you have to close your eyes and hum every time you're reminded it's called Fallout."
2008,Fallout 3,"In Fallout 3 Bethesda has made a very good thing, though it is somewhat hampered by the lack of variable scenery and a VATS that plays less than perfectly."
2008,Fallout 3,"It¡¦s a game that provides action, adventure, exploration, interaction and excitement in a beautifully realised Armageddon that provides so many unexpected moments, but somehow manages to remain consistent and believable."
2008,Fallout 3,"Though Fallout 3 is a good game and it lived up to all my expectations, it is certainly not for anyone wanting a quick game."
2008,Fallout 3,"Fallout 3 is an incredibly well-accomplished game that lets players explore a rich, diverse and interesting landscape however they see fit."
2008,Fallout 3,"This is a massive game: in a month that's seen the release of five or six of the year's best titles, I reckon this is the absolute peach. It's packed with interesting places, with choices to make, with that nebulous sense of adventure you only find in the best RPGs."
2008,Fallout 3,"It's simple what Bethesda's done here - it's taken Oblivion's engine and design ethos, and applied it to a fresh franchise. The results are truly impressive, and we've no hesitation in slapping on a Must Buy badge, but you can't help but notice that for every problem it's fixed from Oblivion, a new leak's sprung."
2008,Fallout 3,"Fallout 3 brings back a legendary saga to the foreground of video games and it does it with remarkable successes. Graphically it is a very powerful title, the ambience is carefully planned, and its size, freedom and scope are its principal highlights. It is as captivating a game in the beginning as easy to forget in the mid term; despite this, we can say that it is a title that is worth trying."
2008,Fallout 3,"After the initial jaunt though, visiting old locations gets repetitive and dull."
2008,Fallout 3,"It¡¦s the big Christmas action game with brains and choices, and with an interest in constructing a refreshingly different world from all those austere near-future manshoots that clog up the shelves. In many respects, it¡¦s a far better game than ""Bioshock,"" most of all because you get the endless choice that promised but didn¡¦t deliver. So it¡¦s tragic that the often awful production values make a fool of it so regularly."
2008,Fallout 3,"I really must say I initially expected a slightly more epic feel during certain segments of the game. Some scenes are a bit underwhelming, as is the very ending of the game."
2008,Fallout 3,"Despite being unable to match the PC in terms of graphical splendour, there's plenty here to keep you occupied, and fans won't be disappointed with what the developers have crafted."
2008,Fallout 3,"Despite the clunky menu system and nearly useless real-time combat options, the biggest complaint I can level at Fallout 3 is that it isn't by the original developer, Interplay. But since we'll never see that game, Bethesda's take on the series is a very acceptable substitute."
2008,Fallout 3,"Fallout 3 is a great realisation of the Fallout franchise in the third dimension, backed by the great tech that powered Bethesda's prior success Oblivion. But the game's greatest strength is also it's greatest weakness. Although you have a wealth of great content to wade through there is also a great deal of repetitive environments and missions. This being said, these minor flaws aren't enough to dampen what is otherwise a great roleplaying adventure and of the best games of 2008."
2008,Fallout 3,"Anyone who played Bethesda's Oblivion, 2006's 'Game of the year,' will find the mission structure familiar, save for the game's auto-targeting system, called V.A.T.S., which is sometimes more of a hindrance than help. Even so, gamers with a taste for detailed storylines and Mad Max style visuals, will find that Fallout 3 delivers a solid, entertaining role-playing experience that will keep you glued to the couch for hours."
2008,Fallout 3,"For lovers of the genre, it's tough to go wrong with Fallout 3. However, if you're strictly a shooter fan or enjoy free-flowing combat, the plodding pace, vast amount of content, and RPG hallmarks (such as heavy inventory management, non-essential quests, and character leveling) may bore you. It's a good game, but certainly not without its faults. A new game engine and better controls would have served this title well."
2008,Fallout 3,"It's unfortunate that Fallout 3 is saddled with so many little- and medium-sized issues, because they get in the way of what's an otherwise fantastic experience. The world is well-realized and full of options. It'll be a struggle in spots, but I'm willing to guess that most people will be able to overlook a lot of the game's problems and still have a very good time exploring the irradiated wasteland formerly known as Washington DC."
2008,Fallout 3,"My issues with the game lie within the fact that whilst playing it, I wished I were playing something else. I wanted to play Bioshock for its heavy atmosphere and compelling story, or Mass Effect because I finally appreciate the dialog trees and voice acting. In Fallout 3, most of my decisions could be argued for the inconsequential feeling I associated with them. That's never a good thing, so it either means Fallout 3 wasn't my particular cup of tea or that it is actually that boring at times."
2008,Fallout 3,"It¡¦s a game that rewards the long-haul with deep, inventive missions which eschew the usual fetch and kill structure, ensuring that the many hours spent in Fallout 3¡¦s wasteland aren¡¦t wasted. [Christmas 2008, p.88]"
2008,GTA 4,"It's got a world you believe in, a cast you care about and a script stuffed with brilliant moments... Utterly stunning in every resepct. [May 2008, p.79]"
2008,GTA 4,"I could go on and on about why Grand Theft Auto IV is one of the best games we've ever seen and why even folks who are easily offended should play it, but that would be pointless. The only thing you need to know is that you have to play this game. Period."
2008,GTA 4,"Expectations were so high for Grand Theft Auto IV that one of the biggest surprises is that it's managed to meet them. That it's also gone on to confound these is truly a marvel, and the game's Liberty City is nothing less than one of the greatest videogame worlds yet conceived."
2008,GTA 4,"None of these little flaws take away from Liberty City's breathtaking vistas, incredibly varied scenery, and lived-in look (the PS3 version has the slightest visual edge, plus motion-control support -- but then it's missing Achievements and the eventual downloadable episodes exclusive to the 360 game). The city just feels alive."
2008,GTA 4,"Almost everything you do in Liberty City would be good enough to drive its own game, and the best parts would be good enough to outrun the competition, but the reason it works so well is that Rockstar has made a game that requires no patience to play. This, as much as its usual coherency and the best script in the series, is what makes GTA IV the best openworld game yet, and why it will take something miraculous to rob it of game of the year status."
2008,GTA 4,"The very nature of the American Dream is the central theme in Rockstar Games' Grand Theft Auto IV, a gaming masterpiece that is a picture-perfect snapshot of the underworld of today's big cities. This is not only the finest title of the generation thus far, it is one of the best games of all-time."
2008,GTA 4,"It's amazing that a sequel that keeps the core gameplay concepts of its prior incarnations can do so much to change itself into something new. Cabs are awesome, as is the cellphones capabilities. But perhaps the biggest innovation is the notion that you can create a game that's as valid a piece of art as any book or movie. Is this our ""Citizen Kane"" moment?"
2008,GTA 4,"I now know how film critics felt after screening ""The Godfather."" It's been days since Grand Theft Auto IV's credits rolled, yet I can't seem to construct a coherent thought without my mind wandering off into a daydream about the game. I just want to drop everything in my life so I can play it again. Experience it again. Live it again...Grand Theft Auto IV doesn't just raise the bar for the storied franchise; it completely changes the landscape of gaming."
2008,GTA 4,"Grand Theft Auto IV lives up to its grand expectations by weaving a Hollywood-ready ""American Dream"" plotline with a finely-tuned game experience -- taking the tried-and-true GTA formula and plugging it into a living, breathing version of Liberty City."
2008,GTA 4,"Considering the fact that it's been a target of political and media pundits who keep harping on the infamous ""Hot Coffee"" incident, it's understandable to think that Rockstar might tone down the adult themes in GTA IV. But thankfully, that didn't happen. This is a mature game, and a devilishly good one at that."
2008,GTA 4,"We all knew GTA 4 would be a great game and sell millions of copies, but I didn't expect it to shame pretty much every other game I've played this generation."
2008,GTA 4,"GTA IV is the best action game ever. The game has beautiful details, nice situations, extrodinary gameplay, sharp humor and great graphics. There are certainly a few minor negatives about the game, but the positive points are just too much. We have one piece of advice: Buy!"
2008,GTA 4,"Smashing down the barriers between videogames and movies, GTA4 is what happens when flawless game design and ridiculously high production values collide."
2008,GTA 4,"A game that you simply have to play. The single-player game, which you can still play long after you complete the story, is the series' best by far, and the multiplayer features are good enough that you'll likely have no problem finding people to play with for many months to come."
2008,GTA 4,"The important thing is that after many years of frustrating missions, driving back home to save repeatedly, struggling with wonky physics, and dealing with farcical storylines, GTA IV has delivered a polished and almost fully renovated experience with a darker and more mature treatment of the subject matter."
2008,GTA 4,"With so much to see and do that even months of play won¡¦t cover it all and some of the tightest mechanics seen in a modern game, GTA IV is every bit as good as you could ask for it to be. You quite simply will not need another game this year."
2008,GTA 4,"In order to describe every little thing that you see in this game would require volumes. There is a staggering level of detail and for every detail we've mentioned so far, there are at least a dozen we've missed. Still, that's the beauty of Grand Theft Auto IV: the details will always be there for you to discover yourself."
2008,GTA 4,"Rockstar North has once again managed to elevate the GTA franchise to new levels of excellence. It's the best GTA experience to date, with a fantastic online mode to boot. Sure, this title does have its share of flaws, but when the game as a whole is nothing short of a masterpiece there is no reason as to why this game shouldn¡¦t be a perfect ten."
2008,GTA 4,"In my opinion, Grand Theft Auto IV is the best game of this generation, thus far, and one of the best games ever made."
2008,GTA 4,"It's not merely the fact that Rockstar have taken an already engaging gameworld and rebuilt it from the ground up, it's the fact that they've done that, and shoehorned in realistic weather systems, day to night transitions, realtime lighting, realistic character movement and animation, realistic physics and kinetics, incidental details, solid and well written dialogue, convincing AI and non-player characters and a multiplayer system that puts other games to shame."
2008,GTA 4,Grand Theft Auto IV is undoubtedly one of the strongest games of this generation. The amount of content is simply mind-blowing.
2008,GTA 4,"Although the joy of unfettered choice is already familiar to Grand Theft Auto players, GTA IV's realistic, wide-open world offers unprecedented opportunities for delightful mayhem, and a level of polish, detail and quality that's genuinely groundbreaking. What more could you want from the next generation?"
2008,GTA 4,"A fantastic, life-affirming piece of software that has set a new standard for what the medium can achieve, with a magnificent multiplayer mode to boot. If all games were this good, no one would ever leave the house. [Issue#33, p.84]"
2008,GTA 4,"GTA IV is the kind of title every gamer must have in their collection to justify their title as said gamer. It's near perfection in all areas, and in all honesty, I won't be reaching for my copy of GTA III anymore whenever I need my fix."
2008,GTA 4,"Yes, there's still the freedom to cause havoc, and inevitably you do; the difference is that you¡¦re no longer impelled to toy with GTA IV's world in quite the same sadistic way - you live in it. [June 2008, p.82]"
2008,GTA 4,"Grand Theft Auto IV is not a perfect game, but it is fantastic through and through, from start to finish and beyond. It is so massive, vast and impressive that it is almost mind-boggling to imagine how much work must have gone into the game to come up with so much detail."
2008,GTA 4,"But GTA IV will never get old, or start repeating itself. It will always offer anyone who turns it on an experience to savour."
2008,GTA 4,"Grand Theft Auto IV is, simply, the latest way to flip the bird. And damn if such a simple gesture doesn't feel good."
2008,GTA 4,"GTA4 is a traditional crime story through and through, with a script that rarely strays from its purpose, a pitch-perfect supporting cast, and an expert combination of in-game storytelling and crafted cut-scenes. [June 2008, p.80]"
2008,GTA 4,"The depth of game, the level of characters and the interaction between the populated world of Liberty City is just breathtaking."
2008,GTA 4,"That psychological side to the game translates into characters talking about how they feel, and about what they're going through. It's extremely well-written and made a serious impact on me. This isn't the carefree killing-and-carjacking romp you might have expected."
2008,GTA 4,"The game is fantastic, a true work of art, and should be owned by anyone who considers themselves a fan of video games. Grand Theft Auto does so many things right that calling it a ""sandbox"" title is doing it a harsh disservice. It does shooting better then many shooters, driving better then many racing games, and has a better, more involved story then half of the most popular RPGs."
2008,GTA 4,"GTA IV seamlessly integrates open-world exploration and character-driven storytelling, unlike any other game to date. Liberty City is now a living, breathing work of art."
2008,GTA 4,"An absolutely essential landmark title for the games industry. In terms of the sheer scope, emotion, ambition, and the stupidly high fun factor it offers, there is no better available in the genre today. In fact, no one else comes anywhere near."
2008,GTA 4,"There is one thing that did stand out at all times: the story, which is undeniably one of the most fun rides you'll ever have in gaming, and one of the most compelling cast of characters to go along with it."
2008,GTA 4,"GTA IV may not have the best graphics, gunplay, A.I. or driving, but few other games have ever combined so many elements so successfully. It excels in creating a genuinely cinematic atmosphere, with writing on par with anything Hollywood can produce and action sequences that would sit comfortably in any movie."
2008,GTA 4,"This is an event game, the kind of thing you simply need to own ... even if you don't consider yourself a Grand Theft Auto fan."
2008,GTA 4,"With three massive areas and your hundreds of square miles of your own personal urban jungle, this Liberty City, more than any other version, is yours to do with as you please. The possibility for creative anarchy is limited only by the expanse of your imagination."
2008,GTA 4,Grand Theft Auto IV is by far the most complete package I have seen in the last five to ten years.
2008,GTA 4,"GTA IV is a game not to be missed, an experience that must be lived by everyone who claims to be a videogame player, and that once again ups the ante for the next chapter."
2008,GTA 4,It's a game of the decade contender. 'Nuff said.
2008,GTA 4,"It's prettier, more detailed and more fun than ever before; it may have stuck to the same formula, but it's as effortlessly brilliant as ever."
2008,GTA 4,Grand Theft Auto IV is a must buy if you like video games.
2008,GTA 4,"I could go on for another couple thousand words about the amazing experience that is GTA IV, but what's most important for you to know is that this game is an absolute masterpiece."
2008,GTA 4,"Rockstar chose to cut off some of the features from the previous games, offering instead a much richer and cohesive world, with an amazing plot and even better cast. Superb in every aspect, GTA IV is an essential experience that justifies as no other its expensive price. [June 2008]"
2008,GTA 4,"At first, GTA IV was sort of feeling like a 9/10 game to me. There were a good few moments where I shook my head and jotted down another negative. But as the experience sank in, as the story captivated me, and as the pace quickened, I was very quickly humbled. It would be ridiculous to factor these minor gripes into even one point of a percentage in terms of scoring, because of the magnitude of the game as whole."
2008,GTA 4,Ignore the score. This bears about as much comparison to the typical ¡§10/10¡¨ game as black and white TV did to colour. What you want to be able to do is tell your kids fond stories of how you played GTA IV when it first came out.
2008,GTA 4,This game is a masterpiece! We have never seen such a harmonic virtual world before. The story is as good as a movie and the graphics offer tons of incredible moments. GTA IV is more than a game.
2008,GTA 4,"It's not perfect, but given the equipment available today, it's as close as anyone is likely to get. Grand Theft Auto IV is Rockstar North's magnum opus and it is absolutely essential. That¡¦s all one needs to know."
2008,GTA 4,"This game has been a long time coming and now that it is here, I can¡¦t even think about playing anything else, it¡¦s that engrossing and easily the best game of the series and the year."
2008,GTA 4,"Rockstar have surpassed themselves, delivering unquestionably the definitive GTA and perhaps the greatest videogame of all time. [June 2008]"
2008,GTA 4,"Grand Theft Auto IV is the sex, drugs, and rock and roll of video games. It's a little less brave and intimidating this time around, but it¡¦s also the most refined and polished game in the franchise¡¦s history. This kind of sheen is generally reserved for titles with a much smaller scope."
2008,GTA 4,"Without a doubt, rest assured this is the best game yet for this generation. The only reason we've resisted giving it full marks is that in the same way GTA III¡¦s template was blown out so much further in ""Vice City"" and ""San Andreas,"" we're confident the next GTA on this generation will up the ante considerably."
2008,GTA 4,"With one of the most compelling stories ever told by a video game, an extremely likeable main character, an insane amount of online modes, and virtually no flaws to be detected, GTA IV is even more than it was expected to be by fans."
2008,GTA 4,One of the most significant changes lies in the combat. The awkward auto-aiming of previous titles is replaced by a useful cover system and excellent lock-on aiming. The usefulness of the cover system cannot be overstated.
2008,GTA 4,It offers depth of experience unlike any other.
2008,GTA 4,Grand Theft Auto IV is simply the must have game for all mature gamers with a gaming console. Either on the Xbox 360 or PS3 you will be blown away with the vast impressive world Rockstar games has concocted in the unique-cool style that only Rockstar games can provide.
2008,GTA 4,It truly smashed the hype and shocked the critics. GTA IV is a game that MUST be experienced even if you haven't liked the game in the past... And what's better is that there is more to come.
2008,GTA 4,"One of the many interesting innovations found in game is the incorporation of a mobile phone, which will become your main tool of trade."
2008,GTA 4,"You cannot fly a plane though. But with the amount of stuff you can actually do in this game, mentioning something like that would be like complaining about the frame color on a Picasso painting."
2008,GTA 4,"From the thankfully-revamped shooter interface to driving sequences that aren't out to simply punish you, from Hollywood-level cutscenes with great characters to a difficulty level that mostly goes up smoothly rather than in massive jumps, this is simply a better game than before."
2008,GTA 4,"The more lifelike direction that the team went in takes a little getting used to, especially when it comes to getting behind the wheel, but once you get over the learning curve, you're handed an amazing experience and hands down the best work Rockstar North has ever put out."
2008,GTA 4,"The pointless debate rages on whether to buy this game for the PS3 or Xbox 360, but the root of that argument is correct ¡V you need to buy this game."
2008,GTA 4,The cut scenes are where the game really shines for me. There is this...this intensity in the character¡¦s expression. Characters are actually emoting and expressing. They bring out emotions in us.
2008,GTA 4,"It's not a perfect game, as there are a number of minor graphical and gameplay glitches, missing features from ""San Andreas,"" more restrictive exploration, and some rather lackluster mission design. However, those minor flaws are overshadowed by the improved gunplay, amazing multiplayer and shockingly addictive social interactions that really turn GTA IV into something special."
2008,GTA 4,"After all is said and done, despite the controversy that comes along with a Grand Theft Auto game, the artists, animators and directors have stayed true not just to their medium but to their art."
2008,GTA 4,"Coming back to our original conundrum, GTA IV has its flaws as a game, like the sometimes problematic auto-aim shooting or the massive difficulty jump when you get to the final ten missions. But as an all-round experience it's truly, hype aside, a standout experience of gaming in 2008."
2008,GTA 4,"If it were up to us, we'd have included a few better missions, weapons, and cars earlier in the game - if only for a temporary taste. That would definitely improve the pacing (while leaving plenty of surprises for later), and it'd have ensured that ADD players don't stop early without seeing the brilliant content that's down the road. [June 2008, p.40]"
2008,GTA 4,"In the case of GTA 4, I think there's a little bit of over hype and expectations being overly high, but when the finished product is as good as what's on offer here, then it's satisfying that GTA 4 certainly delivers a full and rounded package that will please the vast majority."
2008,GTA 4,"Rockstar has delivered everything they needed to here¡Xbigger, better, and most importantly more, more, more GTA. Simply put, it rocks."
2008,GTA 4,"It is as if every great game you ever loved came together in a tantric orgy to birth the second coming of the Lord, it's just that good."
2008,GTA 4,"This is a more refined, smoother game than its predecessors, and is almost certainly the most thoroughly interactive form of entertainment ever created, especially with the fantastic multiplayer options. But it's also more self-consciously constructed than the previous two GTA games, and in my eyes, a little less engaging."
2008,GTA 4,"Grand Theft Auto IV delivers on most of the huge expectations placed on it. The graphics are beautiful next-gen quality, the storyline is a solid piece of writing and manages to feel serious yet entertaining, but most of all the game's environment is amazing. There's so much to do in Liberty City that the game quite literally offers something for everyone. [June 2008]"
2008,GTA 4,"As a big fan of the franchise, I had incredibly great expectations. And I haven't been disappointed. All the series' strengths were perfectly brought over to the next generation of gaming consoles, which makes GTAIV a must-have for fans, and probably everybody else as well. But this doesn't mean that GTA IV is without weaknesses. The camera and the auto-aim-system are still giving players a hard time in bigger battles, and the basically great multiplayer-mode isn't perfectly programmed either."
2008,GTA 4,"Despite a few graphical and control issues, it doesn¡¦t take much away from the fantastic title that GTA IV is."
2008,GTA 4,"To borrow a Jedi phrase,""This isn't the revolution you're looking for."" Ultimately, GTA IV ends up feeling more like an upgrade than a real sequel. Strange, considering that neither ""Vice City"" nor ""San Andreas"" received the new number designation. GTA IV has fewer substantial changes and is far less ambitious than either of its two predecessors."
2008,GTA 4,GTA IV is the best game in the series. It's a triumph - especially in terms of design and character performance
2008,GTA 4,"""Grand Theft Auto IV"" is a remarkable title, boasting not only exceptional online play, but a terrific main story that contains much finer dialogue and character development than previous games in the series."
2008,GTA 4,"The new art direction, investment in physics technology, and better animation sum up to a huge aesthetic improvement over previous games, giving GTA IV a level of visual appeal it strained for in the previous generation."
2008,GTA 4,"Rockstar has outdone itself yet again, with the multiplayer portions lifting the overall game, but there's still room to improve the single-player elements, which feel recycled and drag on at times."
2008,GTA 4,GTA IV is a rollercoaster of emotional gaming hidden under the typical killing and murderous maiming so perfectly provided by the GTA franchise.
2008,GTA 4,"The nature of the open-ended gameplay still makes for memorable random and not-so-random occurrences you'll repetitiously be reciting to friends, but for the most part it's nothing we haven't seen before."
2008,GTA 4,"Perhaps the most frustrating mistake the game makes is in the car combat. When this works, it's one of the game's bright points, as passengers blast away at other cars, shredding metal, blowing out wheels, and slaughtering the occupants, but when it fails, the game is crippled by that failure."
2008,GTA 4,"As a game, it is flawed in many aspects, but as an immersing experience, GTA IV is simply unparalleled."
2008,GTA 4,"But when the flaws that have plagued the series since it made the move to three dimensions still have not been properly addressed and the core gameplay remains the same after seven years, it¡¦s difficult to declare GTA IV as one of the greatest video games of all time."
2008,GTA 4,"The on-foot controls are an improvement but still have a long way to go before I would consider them even remotely good, and I can¡¦t help but miss the huge world of San Andreas. That all being said, GTA IV offers up probably the most cohesive and mature story in the series to date."
2008,Gear of War 2,"It's not as emotionally deep as other games on the market, it's not a 30 hour + epic and it's not art in video game form, but is arguably the greatest action game ever created. In a year full of incredible games, Gears of War 2 sits triumphantly at the very top."
2008,Gear of War 2,"The differences and enhancements in Gears of War 2 feel very calculated and intelligent. It's clear that no one set out to break things that worked before, and the most dramatic steps were taken in an effort to widen the game's appeal to players who might not be good enough to play it, otherwise. But it takes on this task without dumbing itself down and alienating the people who already liked the first game...All you really need to know is that Gears of War 2 is a terrific, kick-ass shooter with enough stuff in it to keep you busy for a pretty long time."
2008,Gear of War 2,"A masterclass in design. Brutal, epic, beautiful and harrowing in equal measure, Gears Of War 2 announces Epic¡¦s reign as the king of the action videogame. Absolutely essential."
2008,Gear of War 2,"While it's certainly open to debate, we're going to go out on a limb and call Gears of War 2 the most visually impressive game of all-time."
2008,Gear of War 2,"As great as the campaign is, the game will see its longest legs from multiplayer. And from the multitude of competitive match types to the addictive and strategic co-op Horde mode, what felt like a hugely entertaining afterthought in the original Gears now easily stands shoulder-to-shoulder with the campaign."
2008,Gear of War 2,"Granted, Gears 2 isn't the smartest shooter on the market, but for now, it is probably the must-own title of this holiday season for Xbox 360 gamers."
2008,Gear of War 2,"Exceeding already lofty expectations, Gears of War 2 raises the bar a notch for action games this holiday season, and that is no small feat. If you don¡¦t have an Xbox 360 yet, Gears of War 2 is as good a reason as any to compose a short letter to Santa."
2008,Gear of War 2,"As a sequel, you¡¦d be hard-pushed to track down a game that is as brilliantly structured, nurtured and evolved as Gears of War 2. With a ruthlessly enthralling pace and variation of set pieces, this is an effortlessly superb package. I haven¡¦t enjoyed a game as much as this since Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, which is surely one of the greatest compliments a title can get."
2008,Gear of War 2,"Gears of War 2 does everything you wanted the original to do and then some. I have never been so hooked on a game. I couldn't put it away until I beat it. I just couldn't get enough of the intense action, the beautiful visuals and I especially couldn't get enough of the story."
2008,Gear of War 2,"Tearing into Gears 2 is a treat--this blood-soaked sequel offers a smorgasbord of sadistically entertaining content. [Dec 2008, p.78]"
2008,Gear of War 2,"Gears of War 2 is, simply put, an improvement in every aspect."
2008,Gear of War 2,Gears of War 2 is a stellar shooting game and easily one of the best games of the year.
2008,Gear of War 2,"Just in case I haven't been absolutely clear about this, you need to get Gears of War 2. Now."
2008,Gear of War 2,"Possibly the single best action game ever, but certainly in the history of the Xbox 360 is all you need to know about this must buy game. The co-operative gameplay, multiplayer and The Horde mode are also great additions for the gamer who likes to play with friends."
2008,Gear of War 2,"All of the multiplayer, both co-op and competitive, completely makes up for any that was lacking in the first game. For those that thought that Gears just wasn¡¦t suited to multiplayer gameplay, that it was too tactical and slow and was better suited to a single player experience, prepare to eat your words. It¡¦s fantastic, and rounds out the complete package that is Gears of War 2...Gears of War 2 is about as close as you can get to the perfect gaming package."
2008,Gear of War 2,"We have yet to play a perfect video game but Gears 2 get¡¦s really freaking close; probably closer than any action game has gotten before. Every aspect of the game: gameplay, controls, features, graphics, and audio have a triple A feel to it and during the first play-through every single gamer will get multiple ¡§oh sh.t¡¨ moments."
2008,Gear of War 2,"Gears of War 2 is the kind of game that third person shooters should try to imitate. We are not talking about the chosen theme or its tactical arcade scope, but instead we want to point out how well the console resources have been used in order to get an impeccable gameplay. A must have. The total shooter."
2008,Gear of War 2,"Gears of War 2 delivers on every one of its promises, combining a rich and intimate story, brutal, visceral combat, incredible graphics, outstanding audio design, a strong soundtrack, and a robust multiplayer suite."
2008,Gear of War 2,"Cliff Bleszinski and the boys at Epic games really outdid themselves. Not only have they addressed the problems of the first game (skimpy story and short campaign mode etc), but the multiplayer additions and new game modes are great and insure the game will be dominating Xbox Live for years to come."
2008,Gear of War 2,"I pity the developers that have to release their games around the same period as this, because Gears of War 2 is magnificent."
2008,Gear of War 2,"Gears of Wars 2 is what epic masterpieces are made of and on top of that it raises the bar for all action games on the Xbox 360. It¡¦s an over-the-top, action junkie¡¦s dream come true that easily surpasses the much-loved original that still haunts the dreams of all Xbox owners."
2008,Gear of War 2,"It has non-stop action, fresh gameplay, varied environments, an engrossing storyline, multiplayer that will have people busy for years to come, and some of the nastiest and coolest kills I¡¦ve seen in a videogame."
2008,Gear of War 2,"Gears 2 is a lesson in masterful pacing; whether it¡¦s lulling you into a false sense of security, dropping you into an inescapable situation, or blowing your hair back with a ¡¥speeder bike¡¦ vehicle section. It¡¦s a ripping good yarn that is continually one-upping itself by belting you upside the head with yet another over the top action sequence that eclipses the last awesome thing you just did."
2008,Gear of War 2,"The game consistently manages to put impressive, holy crap-worthy stuff on-screen. Your ears get their fair share of candy, too. Voice work is almost always right on and the music is epic, foreboding, and dangerous."
2008,Gear of War 2,"Our favorite new addition to the Gears multiplayer family, however, is Horde. A fiveplayer co-op romp played on any of the 15 maps, Horde throws wave after wave of increasingly difficult Locust foes at you and your friends for 50 rounds, putting your teamworking skills to the ultimate test."
2008,Gear of War 2,"Gears of War 2 isn't quite the landmark title that first game was, but it's still one of the best third-person shooters ever made."
2008,Gear of War 2,"Gears of War 2 is one of the greatest games of the year and if you're even remotely interested in its genre and do not own an Xbox 360, then seriously consider getting one - it is THAT good."
2008,Gear of War 2,Gears 2 has taken everything that the original did well and added some pretty good improvements making it a well rounded package.
2008,Gear of War 2,Gears of War 2 is a perfect example of blending game and art. An engrossing plot with emotion and battles on an absolute huge scale make this simply an experience that needs to be had by any gamer.
2008,Gear of War 2,"It's simply the gameplay, graphics and sound all being at an incredibly high level and it all seemingly complimenting one another to create one of the most satisfying sci-fi/action experiences currently available in gaming."
2008,Gear of War 2,Probably one of the best online multiplayer games on the Xbox 360.
2008,Gear of War 2,"One of the finest action games of the year that improves on the original in every way. [Christmas 2008, p.56]"
2008,Gear of War 2,"There¡¦s not much more to say than if you love shooters, you need Gears of War 2."
2008,Gear of War 2,That Cliff Bleszinski and his crew have taken one of the most beloved Xbox 360 titles and managed to improve on it in every discernable way is nothing short of remarkable.
2008,Gear of War 2,"Epic, knowing the success of the first installment, has not taken any risk at all and gives us what they know we are going to like: an extraordinary pure action experience, outstanding in all technical and gameplay aspects and, above all, is hugely entertaining and guarantees hundreds of hours of adrenaline rush thanks to its campaign mode and online play through Xbox Live."
2008,Gear of War 2,"With an explosive single player, improved multiplayer, and an all-around polished feel, Gears of War 2 is better than the original by a large margin."
2008,Gear of War 2,Gears of War 2 is a darker and larger experience then the first game which will please all the gamers looking for a ¡§bigger and better¡¨ version of the original.
2008,Gear of War 2,Gears of War 2 helps to change the perception of the 'angry space marine' shooter by thanks to a compelling story at its core. There are points in Gears of War 2's ridiculous and explosive Brumack set-pieces that you'll wonder how you'll ever be able to go back to the original game without being under-whelmed.
2008,Gear of War 2,"Gears of War 2 is a fantastic game, with an epic campaign, incredible Horde co-op experience, and improved multiplayer; all in a package that promises to keep players entertained for dozens, if not hundreds of hours. Several issues keep the game from being all it could be, but it remains a worthy addition to any 360 owner's library."
2008,Gear of War 2,"Gears of War 2 manages to be everything that the sequel to an intense, violent shooter should be."
2008,Gear of War 2,"Action fans everywhere are going to adore it, but I recommend everyone play it. It¡¦s big, brash, loud and full of ball-shrinkingly deadly scenarios and for that, we can forgive the predictability of the rest of it."
2008,Gear of War 2,"In conclusion, Gears of War 2 is truly an epic game that goes beyond its predecessor and offers gamers another truly outstanding gaming experience."
2008,Gear of War 2,"It provides a truly electric action experience, building on the original with intense, astonishingly epic set-pieces. What's more, the presentation is the closest we¡¦ve got to starring in a full-blown action flick. However, the game is also bereft of any genuine surprises and for all of its stunning visuals and masterful firefights, it¡¦s all a little too predictable."
2008,Gear of War 2,"In the end, Gears of War 2 achieves exactly what it sets out to do: make a better Gears of War. It's an accomplishment worthy of praise, but knowing what Epic is capable of, we really wish they would have pushed the envelope a bit more on the campaign mode."
2008,Gear of War 2,"Gears of War 2 is one big roller coaster ride full of impressive moments. When the ride ends, there¡¦s still the vast array of multiplayer possibilities to be discovered. The core gameplay of Gears of War remains intact, and some minor bugs I encountered lower the score a little bit, but don¡¦t let that keep you away of this shining masterpiece."
2008,Gear of War 2,"Gears of War 2 takes the formula established by the original and polishes it to great effect. Everything from the pacing of the campaign, tuned difficulty, added weapons and enemies, and slew of multiplayer options demonstrates mastery in design that all action games aspire, yet precious few achieve. Not everything is rosy--chalk the poor story and lame characters as being yet another victim of cheesy game writing. That's excusable, though."
2008,Gear of War 2,"Gears of War 2 doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it does bring a good bit of polish to the concepts that made the first such a success."
2008,Gear of War 2,"If you're hoping for something epic or monumental (like, for example, MGS4 or Mass Effect; two games that still managed to blow my insanely high expectations out of the water), you may be slightly disappointed. That said, it's important to note that the only reason I'm saying this is to keep your standards in check - Gears 2 is by all measure a must-have title for the Xbox 360."
2008,Gear of War 2,"Gears does what it does flawlessly. It's not the best shooter ever, but it's definitely the best Gears. [Christmas 2008, p.50]"
2008,Gear of War 2,Highly addictive online modes dull the pain of mundane offline play.
2008,Gear of War 2,"The best single-player shooter in the history of Epic Games. If it is going to become a Hollywood movie, it should be directed by no other than Michael Bay."
2008,Gear of War 2,"There are very few ways that Gears of War 2 could be improved on. Only the story and the final boss in particular are a slight disappointment. Fanboys will love the fact that only one of a multitude of story arcs is concluded; everyone else will feel slightly unfulfilled. But aside from this, Gears 2 is not just the most exhilarating game you'll play this year, but possibly the most heady and downright shocking piece of entertainment full stop. Hollywood, your days are numbered. [Dec 2008, p.61]"
2008,Gear of War 2,"The real star, however, is Horde, a ballistic assault on your worst score-rush tendencies that transforms maps into Gears-flavoured Mutant Storm: weapons spawn, then a wave of enemies hits, then more weapons and then another, tougher, wave."
2008,Gear of War 2,"We could be critical of Gears of War 2 simply offering more of the same, but the fact that it simply does everything better than the original in delivering a fantastic display of shoot-¡¦em-up mayhem its quality simply shines through. With some awesome level design, supported by unsurpassed visuals and relentlessly entertaining action it is a compelling experience from start to finish. Forget the crack at putting emotion into the storyline; it¡¦s almost irrelevant as Gears of War 2 is an allguns- blazing extravaganza and, as such, it¡¦s just a glorious shooter that very few can match."
2008,Gear of War 2,"An average vehicle mission and a couple unimaginative boss battles knock it down a peg, but Gears of War 2 is still a magnificent third person shooter and one of the year's best."
2008,Gear of War 2,"If we were to summarize Gears of War 2 in one sentence it would be ""intense and impressive action, preferably experienced together with a friend"". There are some flaws here, such as a somewhat uninteresting storyline and some uneven levels, but when the overall experience is nothing short of outstanding we're ready to ignore these minor annoyances. Everything in Gears of War 2 is bigger, better and more bad ass and with an improved online mode this is the game to buy for all action buffs."
2008,Gear of War 2,"Following the old motto ""if it's not broken, don't fix it"", Gears of War 2 evolves upon its predecessor expanding the scope, size, possibilities and much more... this new title simply delivers. Clearly not a huge leap in terms of innovation, yet it is Microsoft's best bet and a sure winning title for this Christmas. GoW 2 is as good as a third person shooter can be today and a new benchmark in the genre. Highly recommended."
2008,Gear of War 2,"Gears of War 2 improves in every area over its blockbuster predecessor, delivering a solid and engaging storyline that goes far deeper than gamers will expect. Throw into that with an expanded multiplayer that will no doubt rule the roost of the Xbox Live most popular list for months to come, and Gears 2 rightly becomes an essential Xbox 360 title."
2008,Gear of War 2,"Gears of War 2's new environments, weapons, and multiplayer features round out an all-around superior action package."
2008,Gear of War 2,"The story may be overambitious, inconclusive and undermined by some queasy sentimentality, but the fine-tuning made to the game's core shooting and cover mechanics make Gears of War 2 Epic's finest work to date."
2008,Gear of War 2,"The title¡¦s relentless immaturity can grate after a while, though. Gruesome executions and grunted, testosterone-soaked dialogue sloppily plaster over the campaign¡¦s heavy-handed morality play. While the plot makes sense this time around, its clumsy mysteries are old hat to anyone moderately well read in science fiction. Still, finding bad things to say about Gears of War 2 is like trying to hate on the ¡¥07 Patriots. The game is impeccably engineered to dominate everything it sets its sights on, and yet ultimately falls short of achieving true immortality."
2008,Gear of War 2,It¡¦s an understatement to say Gears of War 2 is the epitome of action. This game defines the genre.
2008,Gear of War 2,"The combat is fun and accessible, the gore is over-the-top, and the story's spiked with humor (though not always intended) and provides for a non-stop, action-packed thrill ride. Still, whereas the original title was groundbreaking, GoW 2 is simply a honed, rehashed sequel."
2008,Gear of War 2,Epic have managed to improve on Gears of War in almost every respect with this much anticipated sequel.
2008,Gear of War 2,"We're getting a little overwhelmed by the sheer number of Cliffy B interviews, quotes and other Cliff related stuff that have roamed the world wide web the past few weeks. But in all fairness, Gears of War 2 is a more than worthy sequel of its predeccesor. The co-op mode is still a very attractive part of the game, and the same goes for the Horde mode. With more enemies, more levels and especially more blood it offers just what you expect from a sequel. The game rarely suprises, but it hurls enough cannon fodder towards you that it will blow you away."
2008,Gear of War 2,"There¡¦s enough content to consider it a true sequel, and not an incremental upgrade, and it¡¦s an overall better game. The expanded story and new multiplayer modes confirm the purchase, and for fans there¡¦s no way to avoid something this good during the holiday season."
2008,Gear of War 2,"A game that actually accomplishes what most sequels strive to do, which is to be better than its predecessor in every way possible. Gears 2 is a thrilling experience that does all the right things. It has an engaging shooting mechanic, excellent presentation, and a hard-hitting demeanor that both excites and delivers. The multiplayer mode will easily keep you engaged for many months to come. The only thing that really halts this game¡¦s momentum are the AI bugs and lackluster story."
2008,Gear of War 2,"Something of an anathema unto itself, Gears 2 offers more gore, more cursing and more of the stereotypical Space Marine swagger only a compulsive gamer can tolerate."
2008,Gear of War 2,Overall this is another fantastic title from Epic and it definitely lived up to the hype.
2008,Gear of War 2,"Gears of War 2 is almost the epitome of a videogame sequel. It offers essentially the same gameplay experience as before, and yet at the same time it has been improved and expanded in almost every aspect."
2008,Gear of War 2,"While Gears of War 2 might not include the epic changes we were all waiting for, like 4 player co-op and a larger storyline, it certainly provides us with a fun and enjoyable experience that we will all remember. Wasting hours on Horde is amazing and with the new additions to the game, new and old fans will be chuffed."
2008,Gear of War 2,"At a time when everyone wants to turn the entertainment world on its head ¡V or at least be seen to ¡V it proves that the entertainment itself, whichever way up it may be, is what matters most. [Christmas 2008, p.86]"
2008,Gear of War 2,"Marcus Fenix¡¦s Delta Squad is back with more ... everything. Stunning visuals new weapons new lore ¡V and huge enemies. What else could you wish for? Yes, more ammo. [Dec 2008]"
2008,Gear of War 2,"This is a linear adventure through stunning environments and incredible violence ¡V and this is what Gears Of War does best. [Christmas 2008, p.108]"
2008,Gear of War 2,"In conclusion, the millions of Gears of War fans will undoubtedly be thrilled by the sequel."
2008,Gear of War 2,"It improves on the original in almost every way, and maintains its legitimacy with an engaging and lengthy single player story."
2008,Gear of War 2,"The most pleasure from Gears 2 has to be in multiplayer, and I¡¦ve very much enjoyed playing the campaign with friends in ever more challenging difficulties."
2008,Gear of War 2,"Different difficulties, with the option to replay any chapter of the game on the chosen difficulty, lets us take the desired entertainment from this Gears of War, should it be a running through the fields killing spree without any special precaution in the lower difficulty, or a fight for the strategic upper hand on the higher ones. Many different modes -online, two players or solo- and a frenetic game experience justify the interest in this title."
2008,Gear of War 2,"Sure it's uncouth at times, but it stands tall as an example of just how heart-poundingly exciting games can be."
2008,Gear of War 2,"It¡¦s well worth the price of admission, in other words; just don¡¦t expect the perfect shooter. Epic made a lot of good calls with Gears 2, but one can¡¦t help but think that the team is still honing its level design, its pacing, its combat and its storytelling. Should be one hell of a third installment."
2008,Gear of War 2,"The visuals are spectacular, the sound is awesome, the weapons and combat features are great and there's enough new stuff to keep both fans and newbies happy. Nonetheless, in terms of gameplay, Gears of War 2 hasn't moved the series forward yet, which should undoubtedly be their goal for the next installment."
2008,Gear of War 2,Is it worth buying? Definitely. Is it better than the first? That¡¦s debatable.
2008,Gear of War 2,Gears of War 2 is one of the most intense and viscerally enjoyable and sensually appealing gaming experiences that you'll likely have this holiday season.
2008,Gear of War 2,"Overall I can say that Gears of War 2 is not a typical shooter, as Fable II is not a typical role playing game. It is aimed to beginners ¡V it is a so called easy-to-enter shooter and comes up with additional story and multiplayer modes in the sequel. Great graphics, great sound, simple, but unchanged gameplay, and loads of blood guarantee fun."
2008,Gear of War 2,"Gears 2's only major shortcoming is a mawkish and cliche-ridden story, but such minor concerns are unlikely to slow the hordes of young men who will slaughter the original's 5 million-unit sales mark."
2008,Gear of War 2,"For an action fix, particularly Horde mode, Gears of War 2 is recommended."
2008,Gear of War 2,Pick up this game and round up some friends¡XGears of War 2 is this year¡¦s multiplayer experience.
2008,Gear of War 2,"The game delivers the same grizzled, gore-laden action we've come to expect, and it does it extremely well -- but it's as if the original Gears has gotten a face-lift, and been expanded upon, without much real change."
2008,Gear of War 2,"So, Gears of War 2 manages to traverse the difficult sequel terrain with aplomb, but for whatever reason leaves the player unsatisfied. Maybe the inevitable sequel will put some of the vim and vigor back into the series."
2008,Gear of War 2,"It may be short on gameplay surprises, but it's long on visual shock and awe."
2008,Little Big Planet,"There simply isn't anything else like LBP on any system, anywhere. It's a beautifully elegant and powerful creative tool that puts unlimited potential in the palm of your hand. [Nov 2008, p.92]"
2008,Little Big Planet,"LBP is a unique game. It disguises itself as a 2D platform game but surprises the players with a set of editing tools and level sharing absolutely amazing. With a distinctive style and an everlasting future potential, we can say that Sackboy already conquered this industry. [Oct 2008]"
2008,Little Big Planet,"LittleBigPlanet is like a magic trick, and in that respect it feels less like a videogame than an incredible concept executed perfectly. LittleBigPlanet is like LEGO (the blocks, not the game), it¡¦s like Monopoly, it¡¦s timeless... it¡¦s lightning in a bottle ¡V and if Sony play their cards right it could well save the PS3, and propel the console into the stratosphere."
2008,Little Big Planet,"Undoubtedly one of the finest games in recent years, LittleBigPlanet deserves every single shred of a 10. You won't find a more polished or rewarding videogame this year, and for quite some time we'd imagine."
2008,Little Big Planet,"There's really nothing I can say other than this: if you own a PS3 and you don't buy LittleBigPlanet, you are robbing yourself of one of the most unique gaming experiences ever designed."
2008,Little Big Planet,"It¡¦s a multiplayer riot, a visual landmark, a feat of engineering, and one of the most charming games ever made. But even those accolades are dwarfed by its scope, its potential, and the apparent endlessness of them both. [Dec 2008, p.76]"
2008,Little Big Planet,It¡¦s so satisfying to finally have a game that not only lives up to the hype but exceeds it so many ways it¡¦s almost unfair.
2008,Little Big Planet,LBP is one of the most important games to be released this decade. A tall order with the hype machine running overtime for the game but the way it reinvents how video games are played is sure to have lasting effects indefinitely. It is impossible not to fall in love with all the charm LBP oozes.
2008,Little Big Planet,"Little Big Planet is just what Doctor Sony ordered: universally appealing gameplay with an appealing everyman hero that is connected to streaming delivery of new content. Sony should be lauded for such a gamble, and Media Molecule should be praised. This is a rare toy that has the capacity to inspire the inventor, the explorer, and the gamer."
2008,Little Big Planet,"Yes, it's the most charming game that I've ever played, and it's one of the most enjoyable. But the real beauty of LBP is even less tangible: creative empowerment at its finest and an unparalleled motivator to want to create."

2008,Little Big Planet,The best game I¡¦ve played all year. It is an extremely fun platformer with stunning graphics not to mention the most extensive level creation tool I¡¦ve ever seen.
2008,Little Big Planet,"When Sackboy drifts into freefall while skateboarding down a steep incline, that sinking feeling in your gut means that the game's exquisitely tuned physics are working."
2008,Little Big Planet,LittleBigPlanet is gaming¡¦s equivalent to YouTube: an unprecedented channel of collective talent that offers a level of creative freedom never before seenin a commercial videogame. It does for the platform genre what Half-Life did for shooters and what Gran Turismo did for racers; injecting innovation into a rapidly-staling genre and paving the way for the future of the side-scrolling platformer.
2008,Little Big Planet,"LittleBigPlanet is much more than simply a game or even a tool, it¡¦s an experience. The sack people are an infectiously charming bunch and as soon as you¡¦ve settled in you¡¦ll want to stay for the foreseeable future."
2008,Little Big Planet,"A stunning, powerfully confident title that deserves all the praise it¡¦s ever been awarded, the Media Molecule guys should be so pleased with what they¡¦ve managed to accomplish and just as much good feeling goes the way of Sony for putting so much faith in the game and getting behind it 100%."
2008,Little Big Planet,"When it's at its best, LittleBigPlanet offers excitement and the thrill of discovery in ways that no other console game ever has."
2008,Little Big Planet,Media Molecule has created an amazingly fun and deep game that will allow people to create their own games and explore the creations of others.
2008,Little Big Planet,"The developers should be applauded for creating a profoundly personal work that still overtly appealing to the audience at large. But even though it is not the best platformer out there, the game can quite easily be classed as something entirely original for the genre, casting off a brand new tangent filled with wondrous sights and provocative ideas that are enchantingly imaginative and creative enough to be considered truly exceptional."
2008,Little Big Planet,"It's too early yet to declare a new era or direction in gaming, but LittleBigPlanet feels like the birth of a revolution; like through sharing our collective creativity we'll somehow become better, stronger, closer to each other. [Holiday 2008, p.56]"
2008,Little Big Planet,"The online community is brimming with endlessly different styles of maps, as each of the creators' personalities are poured into the fun of constructing them. LittleBigPlanet will undoubtedly keep you up at night, constructing the next big hit for the community - and if you don't care for that then you can still play the plethora of maps being produced by countless others."

2008,Little Big Planet,"It¡¦s a celebration of inspiration and human interaction and a hugely welcome, utterly invigorating experience among usual roster of nihilistic shooters jostling for shelf space this Christmas."
2008,Little Big Planet,The single player game alone is worth the price of admission. It offers a level of detail and value that no other game on the market right now can match. The multiplayer game adds a whole new dimension to the game. The editing /level design sections have to be seen to be believed.
2008,Little Big Planet,"The game PS3 was waiting for - fun, richly creative, and truly fresh. [Dec 2008, p.60]"
2008,Little Big Planet,"Media Molecule has created a game that'll go down in videogame history as one of the best gaming achievements ever, and you'd be extremely foolish to pass this up. There is absolutely nothing out there that can give you this much bang for your buck."
2008,Little Big Planet,"LBP has managed to do what few other games have ¡V it breaks demographic barriers easily. LittleBigPlanet is a robust game that is huge in concept, with endless replayability and a real sense of joy."

2008,Little Big Planet,"An amazing achievement and every bit as intuitive and addictive as we'd hoped. [Dec 2008, p.62]"
2008,Little Big Planet,"What is a simple fact is that this is a must purchase if you own a PS3.

This is, by far, the best game on the system and certainly a serious contender for game of the year."

A must for everyone who loves creativity or likes to explore what the creativity of a passionate community can produce."
2008,Little Big Planet,"Media Molecule has created a brilliant platformer, and then given you the tools to recreate the whole thing over again, or better yet, to create your own ideas from scratch. It's not perfect - the controls could be tighter, automatically shifting between planes can be problematic, the editor isn't quite as robust as you might hope - but what's there is nothing short of astounding."
2008,Little Big Planet,"LittleBigPlanet is a rarity, able to conquer even the bitterest of players.

2008,Little Big Planet,"There¡¦s a ton to do in LittleBigPlanet, this is one of those games that is quite literally hard to describe because it¡¦s hard to choose what to say first about it. Between the levels provided, the complete customization, and user created levels, this is one LittleBigPlanet that will capture the hearts of millions for a very long time."
2008,Little Big Planet,"Fantastically creative, wonderfully cute, and most of all splendidly fun, LittleBigPlanet reminds us of what 'play' is all about."

The game revolves around fun, but also impresses from both an artistic and a technological point of view. The endless possibilities it offers in terms of playing and creating, mixed with the cute Sackboys and ultra-hip overall look, turn LittleBigPlanet into what could very well be a milestone in gaming history."

2008,Little Big Planet,"The game is everything it promised and more: striking level design, great music, easy controls, addictive gameplay, tons of features and collectables, and amazing physics."
2008,Little Big Planet,"LittleBigPlanet is a triumph in every single sense of its concept, and brings almost everything we were hoping for. If Media Molecule polish its little gameplay limitations it is possible for this franchise to become another reason to buy a PlayStation 3."

2008,Little Big Planet,"Play. Create. Share. These three simple words make up developer Media Molecule¡¦s little big blueprint for a charming and unique game that wonderfully brings out the creative side in people. Apparently there are already plans for a sequel, but I can¡¦t imagine how the developers can possibly top this."
2008,Little Big Planet,"The idea around the Sackboy is great - and the gameplay also - easy and intuitive. A game for the young and the old, which can also be a competitor for the Wii."
2008,Little Big Planet,"We're just happy to see a flagship game for a modern system that's about running from left to right and jumping over things. New ideas are great, great old ideas are better, and LittleBigPlanet has both: it's the future and the past of videogames, rolled into one."
2008,Little Big Planet,"A quantum leap in concept and design, and one which falls inches - nay, millimetres - short of a perfect score. There's no better reason to own a PlayStation 3."
2008,Little Big Planet,"LittleBigPlanet may well save the PS3 (if it indeed needs saving), it may be the most creative game of all time, it could well usher in a new era of user-generated gaming, and has a chance of bringing about a 2D platforming renaissance, but all those things are down to you. The game Media Molecule has created won't do these things alone, but if gamers create the levels we think they're capable of, we might be looking at one of the most important games this console generation has seen."
2008,Little Big Planet,"It also has some of the best graphics and audio on PlayStation 3. All of the textures, from a sun drenched African landscape to Sackboy's realistic looking burlap skin look amazing, as do the various special effects."
2008,Little Big Planet,"Little Big Planet is a novel, imaginative, and highly customisable platform game."
2008,Little Big Planet,"Little Big Planet could very well be a modern classic. Relying heavily on user content this game will only grow in splendor with time. The game does hold it's own though with great levels, beautiful graphics and fantastic four player co-op. A somewhat unrealised potential with regards to the controls and movement of charaters is the only thing standing in the way of a perfect score."
2008,Little Big Planet,"A fabulous platformer game and powerful editing tools in one package. Creative players will reach heaven with possibilities this game offers, and others can enjoy fruits of their work. [Nov 2008]"
2008,Little Big Planet,"Truthfully, LBP is a game rooted in production and consumption. The experience is hinged upon consuming and collecting in order to expand your depth and range when it's time to move into conceiving and concocting. Not everyone is going to offer a vision for others to experience, but the revolutionary nature of LittleBigPlanet ensures that gamers worldwide will be enriched a little more each time they turn on their PS3s."
2008,Little Big Planet,"LittleBigPlanet is one of the best and original games we've ever played. The gameplay is perfect in it's simplicity, because the game can be played with only a few buttons.

You'll even get a great editor, free of charge, Offering you tons and tons of extra things to do and to discover. You probably won't play a better game than LittleBigPlanet this year."
2008,Little Big Planet,Little Big Planet is one of the years most stimulating games to be released.
2008,Little Big Planet,"We may have seen level creation before, but LittleBigPlanet is a stirring glimpse of the future. It manages to be both curring edge and classic simultaneously, with neither quality stifling the other. [Issue#76, p.110]"
2008,Little Big Planet,"It¡¦s fantastic, fun, beautiful, creative, and unique¡Xpretty much everything you would want from any game and everything you would expect from a game that came with so many months of hype and excitement.

2008,Little Big Planet,"Describing it as an online community arts program is possibly not the most enticing of descriptions, but it's nevertheless the most accurate."
2008,Little Big Planet,"As a product, LBP is amazingly solid with firm foundations outside of minor movement issues. As an experience, LBP is immeasurable and defined by the community. Let¡¦s hope designers keep designing and further the bar as the game grows older."
2008,Little Big Planet,"Sony's exclusive title shows potential, but it has several areas that need improving. It's refreshing to see a title that has such fun gameplay and amazing customisation options, and we're sure LittleBigPlanet will be around for a long time to come."
2008,Little Big Planet,"Coupled with a robust sharing system that borrows the best elements of YouTube, LittleBigPlanet is less a game than a platform for making and downloading videogame levels. Ultimate success beyond a niche of wanna-be game developers will depend on an extraordinarily active community that gives everyone else a reliable dose of new creations. [*Note: All Variety scores are provided to Metacritic by Variety's Games Editor - Metacritic is not estimating here or on any other game review.]"
2008,Little Big Planet,"If you¡¦re after a fairly intuitive 2D level editor with a vaguely disappointing platform game attached and it absolutely has to be on the PS3, we guess LittleBigPlanet will do. Just don¡¦t believe all the hype."
2008,Little Big Planet,"Having a continuous supply of new levels helps LittleBigPlanet remain fresh ¡V there¡¦s always something new to fool around with, even though there are plenty of half-assed levels out there."

2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,"But at the end of the day, even the most vehement of MGS detractors will put their hand up and admit ¡V Metal Gear Solid 4 is, by far, the most polished combination of presentation and gameplay this generation.

2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,"There is no doubt about it, but this is easily the best experience you'll have on the PlayStation 3 to date, simply nothing comes close to MGS4's presentation, story-telling, gameplay, visuals, and sound. The amount of classic homages paid to the previous games, with one in particular, will leave you breathless and, perhaps, emotional."
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,"A one of a kind masterpiece. I doubt that any game series will ever build up to such a culmination as this one has, with so much thought, effort, and passion put into it. Hideo Kojima set out to move and excite people, to truly make a work of art, and not just a fun videogame. Metal Gear Solid 4 is an accomplishment like no other."
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,"While debate will no doubt rage over the story and its outcomes, there really isn't a single wrong move in the gameplay sections."
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,Metal Gear Solid 4 is a game that pushes. It pushes the PS3 into beginning to realize its potential.
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,"A true masterpiece that will be revered for years to come like its predecessors, but one that will stand through the tests of time and will still be referred to as perhaps the pinnacle of storytelling in videogames."
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,"None of the game¡¦s minor blemishes are enough to detract from its massive overall impact. It¡¦s the surprising entertainment value of the action, the mind-blowing visuals, and the completeness of the story¡¦s conclusion that make this last installment so satisfying. Metal Gear Solid 4¡¦s positive qualities make it one of the most significant game releases of this generation, and anyone with an appreciation for the evolving form of the medium would do well to play it from start to finish."
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,"Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots will surely set the bar for this generations in terms of quality, and should be the benchmark for a truly great game."

2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,When all is said and done Metal Gear Solid 4 is exactly what the fans wanted for Snake's final mission.
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,"The unconventional approach to delivering a triple-A game by centering the single-player game around more non-interactive elements than interactive is sure to ruffle a few feathers; the viability of different play styles might lead people to believe it's a second-rate third-person shooter; and the emphasis on nanomachines and PMCs, without being preachy, might be too topical for some. Regardless, right now it's one of the best-looking, engaging, and emotionally driven experiences, with the gameplay to match, on the PS3 or any console."
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,"As the supposed last entry in the Metal Gear-franchise, this is one major release. Most of the flaws found in previous entries have been removed and the variety in gameplay and weapons is simply immense. The story is told in great part by cinematic video sequences and ingame narrative sequences, and while these are fantastic in many ways they can also become a bit tedious. These flaws are minor though, Metal Gear Solid 4 is a fantastic title in every way and a worthy finale to the franchise."
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,"Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots is the best in the series, the best in its genre, and the best game on the PS3."

2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,Metal Gear Solid 4 is by far one of the best games released so far this year.
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,"It's stupid, it's nonsensical, it's over the top, it's full of awful dialogue, it demands long sittings and it hasn't changed much from the first game ten years ago. But then, it's Metal Gear Solid, so who cares? It's undeniably brilliant, captivating, exciting and downright fantastic, definitely worthy of at least a few furrowed brows throughout the experience."
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,"Every aspect of the game ¡V from the comprehensible storyline to the updated controls, from the white-knuckle character battles to the lengthy cutscenes ¡V it all exudes a certain air of quality."
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,"A hardcore gamer¡¦s game, and it makes absolutely no concessions otherwise."
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,"One of the most rewarding videogame experiences of the decade. Absolutely essentially, regardless whether you are a fan or not."
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,"Dabblers and newbies will find the convoluted, metaphor-driven storyline as baffling as ever, but the tight controls and unparalleled production values should draw enough of them to make this Playstation 3 exclusive not just a big hit, but a system seller."
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,The comfortable gameplay and brilliant cut scenes make Metal Gear Solid 4 a great stealth shooter. There are only two disadvantages: the story is confusing and the boss fights are not as tactical as before.
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,"There are errors and flaws that can be pointed. Thing is, no other game manages to awaken such a diverse stream of feelings in its length. It generates hate, pity and even manages to makes us reconsider what we recognise as the current world, in its unbarred race to armament and technology. This is, at the moment, the interactive digital entertainment high point, setting the bar for originality and overall quality."
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,"If you've ever loved any one of the Metal Gear games, or any moments from the series, there will come a moment when MGS 4 will send your spirits soaring. If you've loved them all, well then there'll be many, many more. It¡¦s a masterpiece."
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,"The game is so well done; I was totally amazed and blown away by it. The story, the characters, the humour, the action, the tensionÿeverything all together makes this MGS game a masterpiece."
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,"There are so many ways to play this game, full on action or slow paced stealth so everyone is happy. With so many cool little touches, this game will take forever to get through and experience it all."
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,"When it comes down to it, Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots provides what may easily be the most memorable experience of this generation so far."
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,"Despite its flaws it's a largely successful of marriage and plot and play, a towering achievement and one of the finest action games ever made. [July 2008, p.60]"
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,"People have been saying it for years, Hideo Kojima is a visionary comparable to a movie producer. He is capable of capturing depth and emotion in his characters like few others have been able to master. This time around, he's had the help of amazing graphics to tell his story. The environments, character models, and even the little intricacies of each weapon Snake holds bring a sense of realism to the title."
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,"Kojima claims MGS4 is Snake¡¦s final chapter. And while I'm saddened to see one of gaming's greatest protagonists retire, I'm thrilled he got such an outstanding swan song."
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots is a fitting final chapter in Solid Snake¡¦s run in the series.
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,"Metal Gear Solid 4 is a work of passion by Hideo Kojima. Often touching the line between genius and madness, he manages to build a truly epic ending to one of the most essential series in videogames history. Improving most of the elements from the previous titles, MGS 4 is a unique piece by its conception and nature, which rightly deserves the love of fans and the respect of all players. [June 2008]"
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,"MGS4 is a masterpiece, arguably the best in the series and - though many will fiercely disagree - ever so slightly disappointing."
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,"But where MGS4 really succeeds is in delivering an experience unlikely to ever be surpassed by Kojima ever again, providing fans everything they want to see, twists you won¡¦t expect and more raw, lavish creativity than the video gaming medium probably deserves."
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,"The most satisfying entry in the entire series. Its scope and emotion are heretofore unmatched in the medium of videogaming (my sister and I were literally screaming at the screen during the climax in a high-temperature corridor), it wraps up two decades of series mythology, and what gameplay there is, is damned satisfying in how it complements the story."
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,Game of the Year? Who knows. Experience of the Year? Almost certainly.
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,"Metal Gear Solid 4 isn't just a game, it's a work of art. By far and away the best PlayStation-exclusive title this year."
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,"It should go without saying that this is a game anyone who owns a PS3 should buy, and it's probably no real stretch to say that people should buy a PS3 for this game alone. It's that good."
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,A gaming masterpiece that provides an experience unlike any other.
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,"We were skeptical that a Metal Gear title would be a killer app, but we were happily proven wrong."
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,"Whether it be shooting from the back of motor bike, escaping from some mecht-like creatures, or protecting a friend; Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots features some of the best gameplay and cinematic scenes on the PS3 to date."
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,"But most importantly, it feels like an overhaul without losing the fun details and epic feel that have always made the series work. [Aug 2008, p.74]"
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,"A unique, multi-layered experience that, when all is said and done, is a worthy conclusion to an important series. In addition to coming through as a sequel, the game stands as a ringing endorsement for the technical capabilities of the PlayStation 3. Some elements of the game aren¡¦t as progressive as its technology, but taken as whole it¡¦s still one of the most remarkable games of this generation."
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,"Coupled with a download via the Playstation Store that¡¦ll explain the series to you so far, this game is playable even if you haven¡¦t been following the series for years."
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,"Despite its intrusive storyline, Metal Gear Solid 4 is a varied, engaging and entertaining epic. It may diminish slightly towards the end of the game, but there could be no greater reward for the fans' patience than this. [Issue#167, p.78]"
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,"The MGS4 conundrum is this: The further you play into the game, the less you actually play. Surrendering so much control to make way for movie sequences is galling, especially when the dialogue makes such a big deal about freedom and free will...Despite this gradual decay, though, MGS4 is absolutely a great game. The second half may lack sorely in comparison to the innovative, immersive brilliance of the first, but only because those early portions reach such inspiring heights."
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,Hours of concentrated narrative abuse can't obscure or dilute the detailed game within.
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,It's definitely one of the premier titles right now on the PlayStation 3.
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,"What's perhaps most impressive is the way you'll feel about Snake by the end of the game (be sure to watch through the credits!). His character is fleshed out here more than any of the other games combined, and seeing him during his quiet moments with Otacon and Sunny gives him a lot more depth than we previously thought possible."
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,Metal Gear Solid 4 had a lot to live up to and it's done so brilliantly.
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,"That about does it for Metal Gear Solid 4, it's an amazing achievement for the teams that worked on it and more than lives up to being a next-generation video game."
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,In case you didn't get it: Metal Gear Solid 4 is THE reason to buy a PlayStation 3!
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,"It feels like Kojima couldn¡¦t figure out how he wanted to end the game, and decided instead to fulfill every possible outcome that fans could want. It seems sloppy, amateur, and almost satirical."
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,"Yet, despite my or anyone else's qualms about the game it still is a great game that can be enjoyed by anyone willing to give it a shot."
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,"Metal Gear Solid 4 is dramatic, moving, challenging and fun, and if you own a PS3, most certainly worth checking out."
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,"For all that, though, Guns Of The Patriots is a magnificently entertaining game."
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,"Metal Gear Solid 4 is essentially the best game out there on the PS3, and can easily compete with any other game on any system."
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,"The long, over-indulgent cinematic cut-scenes combined with the sometimes inappropriate odd-ball humour has had many gamers scratching their heads in confusion. Regardless of your view point though, very few could question the artistic genius behind this latest instalment."
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,"For some reason I felt it was important to play this ""final"" chapter of the Metal Gear Solid series - mainly to see what all the fuss was about - and I have to admit that I did have fun with the game even without a background rooted in MGS lore."
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,"Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots has over 8 hours of cutscenes. Sure, there's a good game in-between, but there are also limits to how much B-grade dialogue and contrived storyline exposition one can take in one sitting. Heavy edits to the cutscenes would've made the game so much better! [Aug 2008]"
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,"Now, on the PS3, Metal Gear has regained some, not all, of its former glory. But weak, reused bosses, a broken online game and the gameplay to video ratio keep it from the lofty standards that Metal Gear Solid set up so many years ago."
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,The core of the problem is that MGS4 tries to be everything to everyone and ends up falling just ever so slightly short of succeeding-- still managing to be a very good game in its own right.
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,"The flexible and creative gameplay elements are stronger than ever, backed by arguably the best engine to date for such a game. After the conclusion of Act 2, the game enters a downward spiral, becoming more of a non-interactive movie and using less of the great gameplay of which it is obviously capable."
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,"Guns of the Patriots is a frustrating, fractured game that turns Metal Gear Solid's world upside down several times over, but never changes it."
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,"MGS4 is not the game it could have been; nor is it the game it would have been had the series grown with the benefit of hindsight; nor is it the game it should have been if you believed that early trailer. But it is faithful to its fans, its premise and its heart, delivering an experience that is, in so many ways, without equal."
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,"Such intellectual depth is unusual for this medium, but to both its creator and its fans this is a deeply personal game. [July 2008, p.100]"
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,"Metal Gear Solid 4 is one of the best PlayStation 3 games. That said, its features, acceptable 10 years ago, seem foolish given the better playing games on the market. Snake's epic, final act just isn't the triple A extravaganza we expected, and it's clear that if Konami intends to continue this franchise or spin off into something new, it needs to study its competition and evolve, delivering shorter cut scenes and superior shooting."
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,"Kojima¡¦s cinematic direction is a massive asset to the project, but in many ways has overshadowed the core gameplay that makes it less fun to play than its predecessors for those that love the style; Play them first, they¡¦re better games, and then you¡¦ll forgive the weaker elements in MGS4 to see how it all plays out."
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,"If like me you've waited a long time for this, ignore the final score, sit back and enjoy every wonderful cut-scene that Guns of the Patriots has to offer. For MGS fans, Kojima-san has delivered a masterpiece, but it's certainly an acquired taste, now more so than ever before."
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,"It is an undeniable achievement: Hideo Kojima¡¦s achievement. No other producer could have made this title, for better or for worse"
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,"While Guns of the Patriots boasts lashings of in-game invention and creativity that's largely wrapped up in superb style and execution, it's all so unforgivably tainted by jaw-dropping gameplay brevity that it's truly difficult to raise the many, many good points above what is, for the most part, a succession of cut scenes that leave the player with an overwhelming sense of disconnection from one of gaming's most compelling characters and interactive franchises."
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,"When placed in the context of the Metal Gears before it, Snake¡¦s latest and last adventure feels a touch diminutive and hollow."
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,"Bold, ambitious and unlike anything else this generation, there lies an experience beyond several oddly disparate parts. A swansong to a breed of cinematic narrative which has finally reached its apex."
2008,Metal Gear Solid 4,"The team at Kojima Productions has at the very least set a new high-water mark for cinematic presentation that I wager any other videogame will be lucky to reach, let alone exceed, for the next few years."
