Year,Game,Review
2017,Horizon Zero Down,"I had no expectations at all for this game. First open world - the developers of Killzone (which I didn't like at all) - how could this be good? Anyways, I bought it because of all the good reviews and I don't regret a second.The only thing that could have been done better is the facial animations and voice acting. Not a big deal for me, but I understand that some of you guys areI had no expectations at all for this game.

Anyways, I bought it because of all the good reviews and I don't regret a second.The only thing that could have been done better is the facial animations and voice acting. Not a big deal for me, but I understand that some of you guys are complaining about that. Could also have been added much more side-quests, there is few of them. Main story (+ some side) is 30 hour-ish, I completed the game 100% (platinum) in 40 hours. There could have been added a lot more to this huge world.I didn't feel attached to any of the characters tbh. The first few hours is perfect, but something is lacking after that.8/10 because everything else is PERFECT.\"
2017,Horizon Zero Down,"The story grips you right out of the gate. Storylines have always been convoluted in open world games because of how sidetracked the player can get with other tasks and side quests. While this does have side quests, they can be resolved relatively quickly (though at the expense of character depth in side quest givers, but that's not necessarily a bad thing).There isn't much that can beThe story grips you right out of the gate. Storylines have always been convoluted in open world games because of how sidetracked the player can get with other tasks and side quests. While this does have side quests, they can be resolved relatively quickly (though at the expense of character depth in side quest givers, but that's not necessarily a bad thing).There isn't much that can be said about the graphics that haven't been said already. This is probably the only game out so far that makes me want a PS4 Pro, but it isn't necessary either. The graphics on a normal PS4 are still stunning. The environments are incredibly detailed and the lighting is outstanding.What really makes this game stand out above many others in its genre is the crafting system. I am tired of crafting systems that feel like a chore, to where it's impossible to craft something useful without going well out of your way to gather the components. It turns crafting into some side quest time sink. Horizon eliminates all of that. I've continued to be able to craft anything I need with just items I collect on my routes through the story. No hours spent farming materials just so I don't run short on supplies further along, THIS IS WHAT QUALITY OF LIFE IS ABOUT FOLKS! It's still a diverse crafting system with many options.The UI is crystal clear, the menu system is perfectly organized, and everything seems to have just the right depth. I'm convinced that Horizon was the product of meticulously analyzing its predecessors and pinpointing what works really well and what didn't work so well, and perfecting everything.Anyone saying this is just another Far Cry Primal has the analytical abilities of a toddler. This is more like Witcher 3's kid sister, and she is a total badass.\"
2017,Horizon Zero Down,"Imagine if Far Cry and The Witcher had a little redheaded baby and that baby ran around fighting robot dinosaurs. That's what horizon is like. Superb storytelling, great gameplay, and jaw dropping visuals."

2017,Horizon Zero Down,"Sony's best game of 2017 so far! If you enjoyed the Witcher 3, you will love this, there's so much to do, the game is beautiful, its a must buy for any ps4 owner."
2017,Horizon Zero Down,"Really great game, especially the AI. The AI is really good. Like when you put down a tripwire robots actually jump over them! They are so smart. 10/10 would play again."
2017,Horizon Zero Down,"Best thing I like is the beautiful open world and nice story.  The graphics are definitely the best ever !One thing I dont like is that  the game seems to borrow some features from other games, like tomb raider, the witcher 3 and uncharted.  Even though the combination works great  , I hope there will be more original-designed features in the future if there is a sequel.

Even though the combination works great  , I hope there will be more original-designed features in the future if there is a sequel. The close combat looks not as great as withcer. It more relies on stealth killing which is more like uncharted. ( ranged combat has lot of fun tho and there are many arrows and traps you can use, more like a hunter instead of a warrior ;) )Undoubtedly, Guerrilla Games has a good debut in an open-world game. This game has best graphics, decent story and attractive combat (if u are a bow-lover ).  If you have a ps4, you should try it because It looks great even on normal ps4.\"
2017,Horizon Zero Down,"What a game! A gorgeous open world that is finally not just an empty shell, but a rich and complex place full of activities and things to discover.

2017,Horizon Zero Down,A ps4 masterpeice that cannot be missed anyoe who owns a ps4. Aloy one of the best icon of future of playstation universe. We need more games like this than filler
2017,Horizon Zero Down,"What an amazing achievement in gaming. In the few hours I've spent with this game, the world is very amazing and the combat is very satisfying. I haven't had a game give me this feeling since The Last of Us all the way back in 2013. I can already tell I'm in a for treat!"
2017,Horizon Zero Down,"Great game, how anyone can score it 0 is beyond me! Great story and great combat. So much to do and so many beautiful places to see in this gorgeous open world"
2017,Horizon Zero Down,"Horizon: Zero Dawn starts as Aloy's personal story and then turns into a bigger, wider experience. Thanks to its fantastic and stuffed open world, its one of the best games of 2017 already."
2017,Horizon Zero Down,"Dont listen to any of the 160+ haters that apparently did not research the game they were buying or are just PS4 haters.This game has a variety of quests and activities for you like hunters lodge quests, bandit camps, collectible items, and you can make errands to get items from merchants.The story has me hooked onto it making me play it almost nonstop.The craft system is easyDont listen to any of the 160+ haters that apparently did not research the game they were buying or are just PS4 haters.This game has a variety of quests and activities for you like hunters lodge quests, bandit camps, collectible items, and you can make errands to get items from merchants.The story has me hooked onto it making me play it almost nonstop.The craft system is easy and the world is plentiful with the items needed to craft bigger pouches, ammo, or potions.The rewarding feeling you get when you take out the giant machines is great and the components they drop are valuable in more ways than one.Aloy is a great heroin and her dialogue choices are a great way to build her up either with her compassion, survival intellect, or by making her a savage brute.The characters you will meet along the way are just as memorable as her and i dont think i will be forgetting them anytime soon.If you are a fan of Farcry and Witcher this game is for you. If not it is a good way to interest you in the genre of RPG's. Go out and get this NOW!!!\"
2017,Horizon Zero Down,1) Good World2) Good Graphics3) Good Story4) Good SoundtrackDon't be mad guys please. Just buy PS4 and play it. Stop hate it please. This game is really good!
2017,Horizon Zero Down,"A near perfect fusion of Action Adventure and RPG with intense combat, fascinating world-building, fantastic design, breathtaking graphics and an interesting story with a great protagonist. Took me over 35 hours to beat this game and I enjoyed every minute of it."
2017,Horizon Zero Down,For Guerilla to jump into the Open World RPG genre with this much awe-inspiring beauty and for the game to damn near perfect definitely earns them a 10/10 in my book. Lets not forget we get Nier Automata next Tuesday then Mass Effect Andromeda a few Tuesdays after that!!!!!!! Lifes sooooooooooooo goooooooooooood!!!!!!!!!!

As you explore the open world you gradually learn more and more. The decima engine is something special and i can see why hideo kojima is a fan. I love the gameplay mechanics in this, its really fun and fluid. This is a great game and highly recommended!!\"
2017,Horizon Zero Down,"Epic Game, excellent story, excellent soundtrack, excellent gameplay,  the best graphics this generation after Uncharted 4, it looks better than all games on pc graphically lmao poor pc beggars keep begging xD"

The characters are interesting as well. I think it has the potential for an amazing franchise. I recommend this original and fresh game to anyone. Especially considering the originality of the theme/story. I give it a 9.2 (10 because I want more people to see and it doesn't deserve the NEGATIVE ""hate"" reviews)\"
2017,Horizon Zero Down,"Horizon Zero Dawn is Playstation's first mega hit of 2017, the game is absolutely jaw dropping in terms of visuals, and mechanically the game is rock solid. Fans of Uncharted and Tomb Raider will feel at home with Horizon.Horizon has raised the bar on what open world RPGs can be and surely will be looked at as an instant classic."
2017,Horizon Zero Down,Why do I always see some folks giving playstation exclusives a zero rating when they either have only rated one game or mostly xbox games.What a mystery.Great game btw.
2017,Horizon Zero Down,"Awesome.Also the game has its own originality, and the world and story is fantastic. Aloy is pure charm and all people will fall in love with her. Playstation exclusive or not, this game is perfect to me anyways."
2017,Horizon Zero Down,"I didn`t believe this was possible: everything open world-action games did wrong in the past years, Horizon Zero Dawn is doing right. You say ""Witcher""? I say ""who""? You say ""Uncharted""? I say ""forget it"". You say ""Ubisoft""? I laugh. This is a masterpiece."
2017,Horizon Zero Down,"While I do think the games story and graphics are nice, but the main draw back for me is the combat system and quest. The quest got really boring, with no variety in any of them. The combat system is fun at first but it gets boring later in the game. Plus with no weapon variety makes it even worse.

2017,Horizon Zero Down,"This game is a masterpiece. Graphics so beautiful and even superior to Uncharted4. Along with phenomenal gameplay. With fluid frame rate. Well thought out and creative story. Elements of various games in a perfect match. I just do not give more than 10, because there's no way.\"
2017,Horizon Zero Down,"This game is just awesome, all the mechanics, artwork, voice acting, gameplay. This is absolutely without a doubt the next greatest new IP for PlayStation. Thanks Guerrilla Games!"
2017,Horizon Zero Down,Wow look at all these pathetic xbots and pc elitists with no games to play giving it 0 after only a few hours after being released. Anyways for a start this is one of the best looking games ever and the best looking game on console by far. Uncharted 4 is a close second and thats it. Ten hours in and I never get tired of just walking around climbing and doing nothing lol. Gameplay is soWow look at all these pathetic xbots and pc elitists with no games to play giving it 0 after only a few hours after being released. Anyways for a start this is one of the best looking games ever and the best looking game on console by far. Uncharted 4 is a close second and thats it. Ten hours in and I never get tired of just walking around climbing and doing nothing lol. Gameplay is so addictive. Every encounter is different. You have to figure out their weaknesses and how to move and respond. The story is surprisingly more engaging than I thought. Actually it seems to be very well written so far. Obviously in 2017 it is hard to avoid cliches with being raised and the loner type person but you cant really criticise that. Crafting and armor and weapons are great and diverse. I know there is a lot more because I seen somebody a few days ago in a playthrough with the whole weapon wheel filled so I'll just say myself that its very in depth. Nothing bad apart from slowish close combat at times and a few not the best executed voice acting lines but not game breaking. Its open world so with all the dialogue needed to be recorded thats something I could forgive and forget. Overall the voice acting is great. So far 10/10 and I don't see myself changing my mind\
2017,Horizon Zero Down,"Horizon Zero Dawn is fantastic game.. Graphic, story, gameplay are top notch. Missions don't feel repetitive to me. i am enjoying every minutes of it. Map is huge. i recommend anyone to play this"
2017,Horizon Zero Down,"I was very sceptical about this one because I thought this would be another Ubisoft-ish game but once I played the first hours, boy was I wrong. It got the story, the graphics, the gameplay, the soundtrack, the side quests and the art design, everything about this game is amazing. If you have a PS4 you should really check this one out"
2017,Horizon Zero Down,I'll never understand the negative reviews for a game like this. Lets be honest people! It's a shame to think this game is a 0 out of 10! I've only played about 2 hours so far. Solid game with the best graphics i've seen.
2017,Horizon Zero Down,"HZD is a perfectly competent game, fairly well crafted with all the tropes of other open world games. It shines best when you're in jungle areas fighting robot dinosaurs, with a combat system that gives you multiple approaches to fighting, rewarding precision shots to take enemies out by targeting components, with some impressive static visuals.

It shines best when you're in jungle areas fighting robot dinosaurs, with a combat system that gives you multiple approaches to fighting, rewarding precision shots to take enemies out by targeting components, with some impressive static visuals. Its a real showcase of the power of the PS4 Pro. However, the game has some serious faults. Large sections of the game have you fighting human enemies in corridors similar to Uncharted, and with some mediocre AI and visuals, they get boring fast. Other sections dump exposition on you with audiologs, as much as a 40 minute stretch of playing Gone Home. Though the visuals are impressive for static pictures, once you interact with the environment or look around, the lack of motion in the environment, how plants and water don't react to you, how draw distances are obscured by fog in almost every area and many sections are low visibility to the point of resembling Silent Hill makes even the graphics unimpressive at times. What Horizon Zero Dawn does well is just a pretty routine affair of copying what other great games have done, and its a good showing for that, but what it doesn't do is add much to the genre or come up with any hook or innovation. If you've played Skyrim and Far Cry and Arkham and so on already, this game might get repetitive fast.\"
2017,Horizon Zero Down,Great Story. Great AI. Great controls. Great battle system. Great characters. Graphics are ridiculously beautiful. Aloy really got me in the first seconds of the game. 10/10
2017,Horizon Zero Down,This is handsdown guerilla's best game the graphics are phenomenal with a stable framerate on top of thatThe story is interesting but it is in the gameplay department where the  game shines very fun to play and makes you think tactically to take down the robots . Another astounding exclusive for the ps4

2017,Horizon Zero Down,"This is one of those game that, once again, reminds you that Xbox doesn't have anything close to this kind of caliber.

2017,Horizon Zero Down,"This game is truly what defines Guerilla Games as developers, and will be looked at in the years to come, as one of the best games the PS4 has to offer."
2017,Horizon Zero Down,"This game is a hybrid of Rise of the Tombraider and Far Cry Primal.  Other than the graphics, I don't know if it's offering anything new.  It's over hyped.  I think Nioh thoroughly, on many levels for gameplay, blows this game out of the Horizon."
2017,Horizon Zero Down,"Just unbelievable.It really is one of the greatest Games released over the last few years.There really are no big flaws, it works just perfect.The Story is surprisingly good.I know there will be a lot of 0-Ratings here, as always.

There is alot of repetition and i didn't feel the game clicked overall, there are some nice set pieces, but they dont come together as a cohesive experience to match the price.Campaign could have been better. Some game A.I. issues seemed  to crop up in early footage when dealing with in game enemies, which have since been removed from Youtube.As a fan of the genre, i would recommend considering whether some wish to perhaps wait or skip.The open world genre has become somewhat obsessed with more of the same, wouldnt be that different to throw on a game you've already played, which would probably cost you less.There are other games that are doing more creative things with the genre also, however we are seeing less of that..\"

2017,Horizon Zero Down,"Highly mediocre game that follows the standard open world formula and falls flat on bringing anything new to the table. The main character of the game is Aloy a girl who is part robot part human and different, woah woah, from everyone else.

She's just yourHighly mediocre game that follows the standard open world formula and falls flat on bringing anything new to the table. The main character of the game is Aloy a girl who is part robot part human and different, woah woah, from everyone else. Her voice acting is sub-par by today's standards as well as her animations, lipsync, character development, and general personality. She's just your typical witty heroine against the world cause something bad happened to her.The combat of the game is slow and monotonous. Usually you just sit back and use arrows and when they get close you roll away with your unlimited i-frames and unlimited stamina. There are options to use traps and such but I never found a use for them outside of where the game forces you to use them. My largest gripe with the combat is how dumb the arrow system is. You have to craft arrows as you need them and that could be a cool mechanic but Horizon zero Dawn just puts it down to a simple button press. You get loads of scraps from enemies and then just press a button. There's no animation, no thinking, no wait time, no anything. You craft them mid combat with no repercussion. The game could at least have you stop and do a little animation leaving you open for attack but no.The entire inventory system of the game is flawed too not just crafting. Every enemy drops a bunch of crap, you're very limited on space until you expand, and even will a fully expanded inventory you still fill up with ease. The game wants you to do management but the usefulness of items is so poorly portrayed since everything is automated I have no idea what to ditch and what to keep. Often times I will ditch an item only to have it needed in the next quest I picked up, it's a huge pain.The graphics on the game can be good at times, mostly in screenshots. Animations are poorly done in this game on everything that isn't a robotic animals. Humans, realistic wildlife, and foliage are all just choppy or weightless. The animation that most irked me was the lifeless look of Aloy's bow drawing animation. There's nothing behind it and having to look at it as often as you do you'd think the developers would put a lot of time into it specifically. But it's boring and weightless. Just awful to look at. I've had a few enemies glitch into rocks and other terrain as well as NPCs bug out during dialogue and sometimes stop moving entirely. Very immersion breaking. On the plus side the textures for a lot of things such as the robots and plants are very well done. Again the human assets are poorly done.I don't want to spoil the story too much but let me just say that it's very generic and exactly what I expected out of it. There was a chance for a twist and the game decided to just go the typical route. The ending does set it up for sequel potential, I don't see it getting one, but it's there. Everything is tied up at the end so don't throw a fit at a cliffhanger.All in all game looks pretty in screenshots and can have a few fun moments like sliding while shooting. But they get boring fast and the game leaves little to keep attention. Typical overworld game bogged down by glitches, bland gameplay, and a very easy to read story.\"

It seems like they did an excellent job with the graphics, but rushed the animations. You'll see animations of people sliding when they're walking, which reminds me of the NBA 2k series. The voice acting is okay but very monotone. Also, this game seems to push a feminist agenda, which was smart of Guerrilla Games, as I'm sure it helped them court high reviews from the critics. Combat is almost entirely bow and arrow and this is very disappointing to me. It gets very repetitive and downright boring after the first few hours. The bow doesn't even act like a traditional bow, but rather like a sniper rifle, which just seems so unrealistic. The side quests seems like pointless chores. It really seems that they went for quantity over quality with these side quests. They're really really bad compared to the likes of Fallout and Witcher. It really seems that this game tried to incorporate elements from various other RPGs and the end results is an unoriginal and forgetful game. Some of the best visuals ever on a console. Rivals PC graphics. But the core gamplay and story is completely lacking.\"

2017,Horizon Zero Down,The game looks beautiful and the facial animations have set the standard for games. The story however is there to push an agenda. Personally I could not finish the game because of all the blatant propaganda. The same as you will now find in Hollywood.

Combat is uninspired,  the RPG mechanics feel tacked on, the AI is easily exploited especially when coming out of tall grass, and the story is.... well... laughably bad. The animation and acting is simply bizarre to look at, and the overall implication of the narrative that a certain race of people ruined things for everyone is horribly bigoted and offensive. This game is simply not worth your time in any sense of the word. It is, in essence, an Assassin's Creed type game. It is promoting itself on this promise of delivering a game with a really cool idea, but the reality of the experience is more than simply lackluster. It is downright pathetic.Buy the new Zelda instead. The demo at E3 had more stuff to do and see than everything in Horizon Zero Dawn.\"

No surprises and unnecessary combinations. We finally get the finished product in terms of visual and sound. The game is well-run with a satisfactory combat system. Each mission is different, side missions are not self-inflicted.The Dutch studio creating the feature page was very much drawn from the CD Projekt production, only Aloy is devoid of the axle that we could blame the Witcher. The mechanics are lighter, simpler, and the game itself is much shorter than the Geralt story. Horizon: Zero Dawn is a great start to a new gaming brand. Guerrilla Games have shown that they are not afraid of challenges and can create not only beautiful, but also interesting and consistent universe. To my full happiness, I only lacked a more serious approach to the study of dialogues. I have written about polonization. There is no tragedy, but what happens in all the tasks and side missions in this class of games should not happen.\"

2017,Horizon Zero Down,"This game is a near-perfect masterpiece in terms of gameplay, visuals, and design, and together these three factors weave an intricate, dangerous and gorgeous world I relished exploring.Aloy is one of the best videogame protagonists in a long time - confident, strong, funny and emotive, she was a true pleasure to guide around the post-post-apocalyptic landscape. Speaking of which,This game is a near-perfect masterpiece in terms of gameplay, visuals, and design, and together these three factors weave an intricate, dangerous and gorgeous world I relished exploring.Aloy is one of the best videogame protagonists in a long time - confident, strong, funny and emotive, she was a true pleasure to guide around the post-post-apocalyptic landscape. Speaking of which, Horizon is probably the best looking game I've ever played. I regularly found myself marveling at the environments, remnant structures, weather/lighting effects and character animations as I played through. Extra sidequests in which you collect various items from precarious positions atop snowy mountains and dramatic mesas were essential to really take in the scope and breadth of this game. The backstory of the world before Horizon's timeline is filled in with optional quests and datafiles hidden throughout the vast map in caverns, derelict shopping malls, jungles and deserts, and each add a unique take on life as we know it, long gone from the planet in Horizon. The variety involved travelling around either by foot or on one of the many equestrian-style machines is admirable. The story itself is great, with enough twists and turns and emotion to drive you onwards to learn the truth of Earth's current circumstances. A few developments really blew me away towards the end - be ready! A highlight for me was uncovering the secrets of optional 'cauldrons', creepy, mysterious factories deep under the ground from before the fall of society, these are definitely worth going out your way to complete, as they add a fantastic slant to the plot.Combat is absolutely fantastic and very challenging. One wrong move can put you in an extremely compromising position, with the mechanical beasts proving incredibly violent and clever. They will gang up on you, corner you, unleash desperate charges and barrages of missiles or lasers, necessitating fast reflexes and sharpshooting. Luckily Aloy has you covered. With excellent bow mechanics, reaction time speed-altering, decent melee and a variety of sneak attacks, traps, elemental weapons and even the opportunity to turn machines against each other, you always have the tools to succeed. Death is frequent, but always deserved, making each battle won feel like a true achievement, and allowing for some titanic struggles against some of the gargantuan creatures on offer. Stormbirds specifically present exhilarating and occasionally terrifying encounters.There are a few TINY issues with the game - occasionally hammy dialogue, a limited (but acceptable) weapon/customisation, less thrilling human battles, and a disappointing final battle (followed by a solid story ending). None of these spoil the game in too much and | wholeheartedly award it a 10. Never have I be so stunned by a game world before - the beauty and visceral energy in it is something of a wonder, and it truly compels you to want to explore every part of the map, fight every  ruthless machine (beating them by the skin of your teeth), collect every trinket and climb every peak.Incredible game-making from Guerrilla.\"

The variety of mechanics and weapon-types gives you opportunities to discover tactic against every enemy. And the feeling after beating your first Thunderjaw is just worth the effort of learning them all.The story that this game tells is rather standard hero journey type but it feels really satisfying to go through. You start as nearly nobody and end as a chosen one, and most powerful character in the end. It is pleasing to look back at the route you have gone through. It has that magic feeling of discovering a new, fantastic world that you are a huge part of.The worst part of the game are the plot of quest and characters. After playing Witcher 3 I expect a little more depth from that little stories, not just the main one. Characters are flat and mostly black-and-white. Purely good (like Avad) or purely bad (like Helis). The most interesting one was NIll - guy who kills bandits not to do some good, but because he likes too kill. Oh and maybe Erend before he sobered up.But the main character of the story is the world itself. It is beautifully crafted and you really want to get lost in it. And I did. For like 80 hours. I recommend you do it as well.\"

Gameplay is amazing and the machines, world, story are great. Only if the mid game wasn't threatening me with stopping the game all together- Great combat mechanics: In its most basic form there are 3 elements which are electric, fire and ice. With your scanner you can see what the weaknesses are from the enemies and utilize it. It's easy, fluid and it works. If you are getting more into the game you will realize that there are more ways. For example tear arrows can disassemble certain parts of machines, removing the ability to use an attack and even giving you that weapon for massive damage, or even hit a tank and let it explode. Tripcasters can setup traps which is actually handy since you can see the enemies walking pattern and ropecasters can knockout a enemy. There are many ways to kill machines/humans and it's fun to figure out the best way.- Machines: They deliver some satisfying battles especially the later ones. Those thunderjaws phew.- Story: Since makers end you are always wondering where the story is going to bring you. It is a interesting story that lets you want to know more.- Graphics & Sound: oh damn it looks great on my normal PS4, probably one of the prettiest games I have seen. The soundtrack is nice in a world like this.-  Extra stuff to do: While I feel like most errands and side missions were a bit overkill, not interesting. There are a few exceptions though. For example the lodge mission and in the end redmaw was a nice side quest.  The rest is nice. I in particular love the cauldrons and what you get from it is a nice surprise. Getting on tallnecks, doing hunter challenges (they were pretty easy though in my opinion). Corrupted zones could be a challenge. The bandit camps were laughable easy.So it is a great game however It feels like there are some flaws.- Just like every open world game after receiving the platinum there isn't anything else to do. This is pretty neglectable though since to receive the platinum you had to do most of the extra's in the game.- Cringe worthy conversations. While it isn't as bad as mass effect Andromeda, it's not like I cared for what they were saying and it like if a robot talked to another robot.- The boring mid game (before meridian) After the proving and before entering meridian there is a part in nora land which was flat out boring. Easily exploitable machines which gave almost no challenge was the killer for me. Also the nora weren't interesting for me. When you got to meridian and unlocked all machines and unlocked that whole desert part, shadow carja etc.. It became much better.\"

Long story short: I'm already in love with this game and looking forward to some awesome hours of gameplay.\

Perhaps the most tragic error though is how nannying the experience is.Collecting a Shine Sprite, or Power Star in previous titles felt highly rewarding because it signifies the end of a challenging gauntlet of platforming variety. In Odyssey, Moons are absolutely everywhere, and unlike, for example, the Shrines in Breath of the Wild, there are simply too many Moons with little gaps between them. Positive reinforcement is one thing, but forcing it every few seconds is a trick that the average player will quickly see through.Super Mario Galaxy 2 can rest easy - SMO in no way betters upon its prequels and should be avoided unless you are a die-hard fan of the series, and can look past the many flaws\"

Except for one. When taking control  of a bullet bill, I can't do a full 180 by holding one direction because the game expects you to change your direction on the control stick to keep on changing in the same direction you were already turning. So thats annoying. Now, I have to admit, the Death System here fixed previous issues but made a new one too. When you die you only lose 10 coins, and when you die without coins, you just come back normally. No negatives. But sometimes you die and spawn waaaaaaaaay far back away from where you died and you have to do a bit of backtracking. So that's also annoying. The bosses are also overused and when you fight them the next time they don't really add anything important. Oh yeah, and it has some nice easter eggs too. Spoiler alerts are stupid, this game can't be spoiled. When you beat the game, you can unlock peach's castle and you will find the courtyard from Mario 64 in a secret door that can only be opened by becoming SM64 Mario! Love that. I just can't give this game a 10 because of some annoyances that turn me off a little bit. For example, while going through the desert, there is too much space for its own good because you can't really do anything besides move while you go to the next spot. It's a little too big for its own good. There is also an annoying boss rush mode where when you die, you spawn back and I can see on the ship that the bosses I had defeated were not there but then I had to re fight all the other bosses that I had killed. Very annoying. Now then, the graphics... Beatiful in docked, sometimes a little blurry in portable mode. Docked always looks amazing no matter what. In portable mode, sometimes the game gets a little bit TOO blurry, and then the resolution jumps up then down and up and down. Also, shadow edges look like crap. Now then, the performance... Beautiful in both portable and docked.  The game uses dynamic resolution to maintain 60fps almost all the times. The only time I noticed it drop was for a few seconds in new donk city.  It also makes the Switch REALLY hot and with it close to me, I could hear the fan going LOUD. The things you do for moons is also somewhat overused. There are multiple places throughout the game that make you put down your hat and do some platforming without your hat. This was fine the first few times, but after maybe the 4th time, I felt it wasn't needed. BUT, the best part is... It's optional! Go find another moon or something, do what you want. Yeah, this game is pretty amazing.\"

It, along with other great games like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, make me not regret purchasing a Nintendo Switch in the slightest.  Super Mario Odyssey is a charming love letter to the 3D platformer/collectathon genre that thrived in the 90s and 2000s, that anyone who grew up with will be touched by.In it, the ever-intrepid ex-plumber Mario teams up with Cappy, a sentient (and shapeshifting) hat creature. They travel all over the world, and just maybe beyond, to save Princess Peach and Cappy's sister Tiara from an arranged marriage with Bowser.  Mario and Cappy's travels will take them to a total of 17 different expansive locales, from the bleak, foggy, moonlit landscape of Bonneton, to the bizarre juxtaposition of nature and machine in the Steam Gardens, to the bustling metropolis of New Donk City.  In each area, they'll need to collect Power Moons in order to power their ship enough to move on to the next area.  Not exactly the most original plotline, but that isn't really ever expected from Mario games that don't start with ""Paper"" anyhow.  The main focus in this series was always gameplay, and don't worry on that end: Odyssey delivers.Much like FLUDD and the baby Luma from before, much of the gameplay revolves around Mario's latest companion.  Unlike, say, FLUDD (disclaimer: I love Sunshine), Cappy feels like a natural extension of Mario's usual abilities.  Cappy transforms Mario's signature hat, something that's been with him on every adventure for the past three decades, into a multipurpose tool you'll find yourself missing when you don't have it.  With him on Mario's side, Mario has the ability to throw his hat in any direction he pleases, direct it or hold it in midair, and have it return back to his head.  His hat can be used as a weapon against obstacles and small enemies, a convenient platform to jump off of in midair, a way to stop himself from falling for a convenient moment (much like the spin jump from Galaxy), a way to remotely collect coins that are just out of reach, and one more function that is by far the most interesting.Perhaps Odyssey's main ""gimmick"", is that Cappy gives Mario the powers of a poltergeist.  If something has a head, and that head isn't protected by a hat (things that do have hats can usually have them knocked off), throwing Cappy on to it will result in Mario's spirit flying into its body, and assuming direct control of it; the captured entity adopting his signature hat, eyes, and moustache.  There's a total of 52 different entities that can be ""captured"", including Goombas, Cheep-Cheeps, an actual human ""New Donker"" who pilots an RC car, traffic cones, a giant slab of meat, frogs, manhole covers, a tree, a few different statues, the letters that make up Mario's own name, and an actual realistic tyrannosaurus rex.  This capture mechanic is used in a wide variety of different ways.  Capturing a Cheep-Cheep for instance will make you no longer have to worry about air underwater.  Capturing specific objects or enemies might also work to your advantage in puzzles, platforming segments, and even boss fights.  The second boss you fight, for example, involves capturing her pet Chain Chomp and slamming it into her face to deal damage.Aside from Cappy, Mario's own moveset has gotten an upgrade, ensuring that the platforming is as fun as ever.  All the iconic moves such as the backflip, sideways somersault, long jump, ground pound, and triple jump are still there; interspersed with new ones such as the ground pound jump, roll, and midair dive.To put this short and to wrap up my opinion on it, Super Mario Odyssey is an excellent installment to the 3D Mario series, capable of standing tall and proud with all its forefathers, even Super Mario 64 itself.  If you're a long-time fan of the series, you're doing yourself a great disservice skipping this.  If you're not, this may be an excellent entry point.  I've never even been motivated enough to write a review for something before this, but I just have to here.  I just have to tell everyone how great this game is, I can't help myself.\"
2017,Super Mario Odyssey,"Mario Odyssey was a beautiful game with amazing worlds and tight controls. It is on the easier side of things, but it is a Mario title so I wasn't expecting it to be a challenge anyway. The way they used Cappy was great and made it second nature by the time you beat the game. Overall Nintendo really knocked it out of the park with their latest Mario title."

Between Sunshine and Galaxy 1 and 2, the traditional Mario (Mario Bros. Wii) fell by the wayside for me... Sure, it was fun, but it just didn't have the creativity of the other three games. And then the Wii U happened... and everyone hoped for a Galaxy 3..... and we got a Mario Bros. Wii reiteration, and then a ""3D"" gimmick of that same formula. These were fun, sure, but they were a sort of mundane fun... something you did not really feel like playing again after winning.(I personally think the Wii U was Nintendo's grace period to figure out what they needed to do, with EVERY franchise, including Mario, because they were screwing up. And boy am I glad they figured it out.)Mario Odyssey is the game that could not be a Wii U game. This much is clear. The fluidity of animation without frame drops, the wonderful controls, the seamless flow of throwing Cappy and using him and jumping on him, the wonderful return to actually great music... Look, the truth is, as you play this game, you will find not just remnants of Mario in it, but also remnants of Banjo-Kazooie's little side quests.I don't want to spoil anything, but I will end on an honest note: if you hated the specificity of controls for that not-so-great Zelda game, Skyward Sword, you will not like the controls here. However, if you give them a chance, you will notice they are much more responsive (the Joy-Cons have much better technology in them than the MotionPlus Remote did).If you loved Mario Sunshine, Mario 64, Mario Galaxy 1 and 2, Banjo-Kazooie, and even Mario 3D World, you will truly enjoy this game and rage a little here and there at some of the more difficult places. As for the difficulty of the game, it isn't difficult as a whole. A few people are upset that this game doesn't use a ""Life"" system; it uses coins. Many of them thought this stupid, but the truth is, you NEED those coins for some of the funner factors of the game (no spoilers), so it does not pay (ha! pun) to lose them by continuously dying - I have no idea why anyone who actually played the game and understood the coin system thought that it was stupid, but that's that.All in all, I have to give this game a 10/10, because the only shortcoming is that it isn't longer - and yet, no game can last forever; not all games can be Breath of the Wild. For Mario, especially, this is a good thing. The pacing of the game is enough to keep you in wonder, and that's what all great Mario games have done since he landed in 3D space.\"

For sure the best looking visual mario game you'll find on the market.However the mario gameplay style in this game is quite unique and genius at the same time by using your cap you can use the action ""capture"" to for example be in control of a goomba or even a cheep cheep, I mean wow... I've always wanted to be one of those, also who would've imagined that you could even be in control of the humans it's very interesting and very exciting on what this capture action can do and gives us nintendo switch players a brand new way to play and explore new things.Mario is trying to save Princess Peach from Bowser as Bowser is trying to marry her the plot is actually a little different although it's still the same ""save peach scenario"" which still works as you have to fight through multiple boss battles although I feel as if it's quite easy to beat them but overall I find the game so easy to just explore and have fun it's the most exciting game in years. This is a true 3D mario game that's for sure, I recommend picking it up as you'll have hours of fun with this and explore and find all those power moons, if you don't have a nintendo switch right now this is the perfect excuse to get one.\"

So if you loved that game or any of the other super mario 3d exploration games like sunshine or galaxy then defiantly give this a whirl you won't regret it and you'll find yourself like me wondering where the last 8 hours went!To sum up this really is a killer app for s switch and hopefully helps establish switch to stay around for a while and shift some more systems this Christmas. also hopefully it attracts some attention from 3rd party dens to make some more epic game for this awesome little console.\"

The mature storyline and the accuracy of how Baby Boomers and Gen-Xer\s will sacrifice their children\s lives for their ownBest Persona game yet. I have played most of Atlus\s games and am confident that this is one of their best. It is worth playing this game for the story alone. Most of the characters are very enjoyable and the plot had me actually feeling emotions, like a real human. The mature storyline and the accuracy of how Baby Boomers and Gen-Xer\s will sacrifice their children\s lives for their own materialistic wealth is incredibly spot on. Combat and exploration have been refined a bit since the last game and add some fun, new, and needed mechanics. The music is really good as well, just like the last game. They took everything about Persona 4, one of the best games on PS2 and made it better. If you missed the last one, get ready for a real  treat.I only have two small gripes with the game. First, it has been ten years since the last Persona game but this feels as though this should have came out about 3-5 years after last one, not a decade. Sure, when compared to other Altus games, this is my favorite, but they don\t live a vacuum, they compete in a market with other game companies. When you start to compare it to the innovations in gameplay of other RPG game designers, Persona 5 feels safe, meaning they didn\t take any risks in the game. We are currently in the beginning of a video game Renaissance and am not sure how my generation will take to the lack of new innovation here. Playing Persona 5 feels as though you are playing Persona 4 with refined gameplay and a different story. They added a couple of new mechanics to the game which makes the series better but doesn\t revolutionize the RPG genre in any real way. I also wish they didn\t guide you so much. After so many my good open world and RPG games over the last decade it is a bit difficult to go back to such a linear game where it feels very little of your choices matter in the end; don\t go in expecting Witcher 3 level freedom. They may really need to change things up a bit if they plan on coming out with a sequel in the future. Still, these small complaints pale in comparison the rest of the game, which is great. This is still one of the best RPG games on PS4 and is the closest you can get to playing an anime. This game is highly recommended for RPG and anime fans, kids from all socio-economic status, and Millennials who don\t want to end up like our parents. EA and BioWare, buy this game so you can learn how to write a story and develop interesting characters that we can become attached to.\"

Each of the party members/other characters are interesting (personally some more than others feel fleshed out or likeable). I love the themes that come up in this game in each story arc, they're pretty twisted like the first dungeon being a Teacher who thinks the school is his own castle and thinks of the female students as his playthings.At first i thought the time restrictions was annoying as it holds your hand quite a bit at least until after the first dungeon or palace as they're called in game but once it passed this point i had this ""need to just get to the next day"" because i could rank up a character social link or a twist in the story happened like that ""one more episode"" feeling when you watch a TV series and before i realised it was 3am....P5 is easily worth its price for the time it will take to complete if you're into J-RPGs i feel i could play through it at least a 2nd time upon my first completion but possibly even a 3rd with everything maxed out as it is just so addictive.\"

2017,Persona 5,"Its been an excellent few years for Western RPG's in general, producing (in my own opinion) one of the most superb games of all times, the Witcher 3. Often though I\ve wondered \ \where are the great JRPG\s of old?\, the last notable one for me being Lost Odyssey a whole generation past.However this long drought has finally come to an end with the excellent Persona 5 \ a great game forIts been an excellent few years for Western RPG's in general, producing (in my own opinion) one of the most superb games of all times, the Witcher 3. Often though I\ve wondered \ \where are the great JRPG\s of old?\, the last notable one for me being Lost Odyssey a whole generation past.However this long drought has finally come to an end with the excellent Persona 5 \ a great game for new starters or those that jumped on board with Persona 4, rest assured that previous knowledge of the games is not essential.Story & CharactersI will just paint this in broad strokes but expect a much darker tone then the idyllic high school life of Persona 4! The overriding theme for Persona 5 is \injustice\ and as part of this, the series tackles some heavy issues with a degree of success rarely found in video games. The story starts out at a sprint for the first hour or so before settling down a bit, then gradually ramping up the intensity over the coming tens of hours \ this is a game for the long haul and represents great value for money.While some people I\ve spoken to prefer Persona 4\s characters I think the Persona 5 characters are more interesting with far more opportunities for character development, romance and interesting unlock-able extras.Graphics & Sound DesignThis is a game bursting with color, imagination and detail. The large hub world (much larger then previous games) is great to get lost in with many various points of interest, the character & enemy models are well detailed and creative, this is a game that proves the race to pour the most money into providing the most photo-realistic graphics is one of the reasons the triple A industry is slowly strangling itself!Simple things like the slick styling of the menus, the use of bold colors, the frequent anime cut scenes make this an easy game to admire in motion. The soundtrack is uniformly excellent with the usual eclectic mix of jazz, vocals and synth, English voice work is solid and will satisfy the vast majority although the option to download the Japanese dub for free is much appreciated.Gameplay and Value for MoneyThe day-to-day gameplay is very similar to previous game, you have one year to conclude the game in and can choose how you spend each day from developing various social links/romances to improving your own stats/making money through jobs to entering the game dungeons in the form of \palaces\.These palaces are one of the biggest improvements over previous games in that they are no longer randomly generated, instead they are detailed labyrinths for you to carefully explore using a variety of stealth, shortcuts and ambushes to navigate. Combat is again quite standard to previous games but is flashy, highly tactical and never gets boring. Outside of the palaces there is also a massive, sprawling, randomized dungeon to explore with a variety of interesting side-quests, this can consume hours of careful exploring and is great for further level grinding (which thankfully is only rarely needed).Expect a long game, this is a +40hr game easily and is available with multiple difficulty levels (including a \casual\ for those that just want to enjoy the story). For the record I found \normal\ suitable for me, it offers a stiff enough challenge without feeling unfair (although I have heard that some later boss gauntlets can be much tougher!) Be warned that failing to complete certain objectives in time will fail the game; I would highly recommend keeping multiple saves!ConclusionPersona 5 is a game bursting with quality, its one of the easiest games to recommend if you are a fan of story driven RPG games and don\t mind a slower pace (with plenty of talking and text to read!). Within a week of the buggy and cliche Mass Effect Andromeda (another long extinct, technologically advanced alien civilization eh EA?) the sheer quality, creativity and artistry of Persona 5 shines through.\"

2017,Persona 5,"Persona 5 follows up on my belief that 2017 is the year of Japanese gaming. Featuring a cast of characters full of life, a fast-paced and fun turn-based RPG experience, with plenty of content to keep you going for well over 80 hours on your first playthrough, Persona 5 kept me up late at night wanting to squeeze out just another in-game day, or safe room.My first introduction to thePersona 5 follows up on my belief that 2017 is the year of Japanese gaming. Featuring a cast of characters full of life, a fast-paced and fun turn-based RPG experience, with plenty of content to keep you going for well over 80 hours on your first playthrough, Persona 5 kept me up late at night wanting to squeeze out just another in-game day, or safe room.My first introduction to the Shin Megami Tensei series was SMT4 on the 3DS, so I won't call myself a veteran of the series, but all the things I enjoyed in SMT4 were present in P5. 4 elemental spells (with an additional 2 exclusive to Persona), Physical and Gun skills, and Light and Dark skills with insta-kill potential on certain abilities. Coupled up with a series of restorative abilities and buffs/debuffs, the game gives you plenty of options in combat, but never feels overly complicated (despite the game's generous tutorials).The game is split in to two styles: the first is a visual novel type, which takes place in the ""real world,"" of various parts of Tokyo, Japan, where you play as a disgraced high schooler hot off the criminal press, having been falsely accused of assault by a powerful and corrupt politican. This leads you into the other part of the game, the ""Metaverse"" palaces, wherein the protagonist and his friends, under the guise of their organization ""The Phantom Thieves,"" rob their targets of the ""treasure"" which influences their specific corrupt desires. The entirety of the battling takes place in the Metaverse, but all of the social actions take place in the real world, which has a great impact on the battling and exploration of the palaces. Both the progression through the palaces, and forming your relationships with the various Confidants, are equally satisfying.The Persona collection/fusion system is back in full, with a vast array of different Shadows to collect and kill to make better Personas. ATLUS adds a nice touch by giving a small background of each of the Personas, and their lore from their prospective mythos or religious origins. A feature I particularly liked was the Gallows, which lets you sacrifice one Persona in tribute to another to make the latter more powerful, and inherit one of the former's abilities. I used this to buff up my starting Persona, Arsene (who is seriously way too cool looking to want to be rid of) to keep him up to speed for most of the game.As a videogame audiophile, I can gladly add Persona 5 to the list of games whose soundtracks I can listen to outside of the game. With a diverse palate of genres, almost all (with the exception of ""Sweatshop"") of the songs kept me boogieing as I battled. The same could be said of the rest of the audio design, full of pleasant swishes and plinks that serve as aural candy with every ""Freidyne."" The same could be said of the Anime-drawn cutscenes, which feature less voice-acting but plenty of beautiful visuals to enjoy, from the opening cutscene to the interludes as they come up. And of course, plenty of tasteful fan service, most of which captures the innocence of adolescents navigating their way through the birds and the bees.If I had one issue with Persona 5, it's that it had to end. Every day I spent in the game with the characters, helping them overcome their particular challenges and share in their reinvigorated view of the world around them was a gift. It makes me wish I felt that way about more real people, but, real people aren't often written quite as well.If you're a fan of RPGs, a fan of Anime, and a fan of good games that know what to do with their genre, you'd be a fool to pass up Persona 5. I never expected to see myself buy the game, but after the encouragement of my peers, I'm glad I did. Persona 5, I truly never saw it coming.\"

2017,Persona 5,"Outstanding game. From the way how the story was told it was great. The game takes off with us around 80%ish into the game already(Present time for the game). Our MC gets thrown into questions when he gets captured and there the story is told by him which results us playing him in the past. Atlus did the story telling really successfully, it really got me into loving how it was done. It was done right. The music, characters, story, man just everything about the game made me love JRPGs more then ever again. Dang, from now on I'm gonna be expecting too much from JRPGS because of P5. When I felt like I was close to being finish with the game, boom they throw another thing at us, yep I'm almost done with the game this time  Boom, another element gets thrown at me. Spent 100 hours of gameplay to finish the game, it was worth my time. I choice this type of game over any other JRPGs and RPG in general any day. Brought back the turn base game with fashion.\"

The cast of characters and story, plus the addictive and rewarding game play makes this game shine. Yes it does get repetitive, but the rewards whether that be for the perks for hanging out with friends, or grinding for better personas, the repetitiveness for me was worth it in the long haul. Plus the majority of the side stories (hanging out with confidants) are truly interesting. Now the core gameplay consists of traversing about 8-9 dungeons, each truly unique and different from each other, until you reach the end boss. Combat consists of turn based gameplay, you either grind away or target enemies weaknesses, forming your own team of ""personas"" (or pokemons per say) and controlling what skills and fight moves you want. It's a lot of grinding but again to me it's also rewarding and addicting. Difficulty is about average even a little easy if you know what you're doing, but some bosses do present a  good challenge. The only thing I truly hated about this game was the chatting after finishing each dungeon, sometimes it takes me a couple of hours of ""cutscenes"" to advance to the next dungeon to progress the story. But overall as a newbie to jrpgs,  I truly enjoyed this game, so much so I bought a vita to play persona 4. Pros: great story, amazing cast of characters, addictive and rewarding game play, general combat. The so-so: can get repetitive for some, most will finish game in 100 hours +. Cons:  pacing issues, too much letter box chatting sometimes.\"

I believe it has been a long while since I truly, genuinely enjoyed a game this much. Everything about it, up to the brilliantly addictive music, pleasing graphics, fun and unique game mechanics, incredibly deep and dark storyline, and the fact that EVERYONE has a story and isn't just some plain side character (which I find to be realistic in terms of real people each having their own story and baggage in their life) has helped me like the game more and more.My roommate and boyfriend have mostly been watching me play and everytime I pick up my controller to play Persona, they're quickly getting situated with me on the couch to watch me play and now they've started their own files on my game. One of my favorite things about Persona 5 is that some games promise longer hours of gameplay by creating irritating difficulty spikes as the story progresses to make the game longer, and yes Persona 5 does have one difficulty spike around the third dungeon, however it's easy to get over with a bit of grinding, and the gameplay is enjoyable enough to not mind much. But overall, the game itself is definitely long because the story itself is actually quite long, not just because gameplay and dungeon grinding is forced to be long. Additionally, there is a Casual, Easy, Normal, and Difficult setting to appease all types of gamers from the ones who would rather sit back and enjoy the story to those who prefer a challenge.I will say that some of the mechanics in the game are a bit frustrating to deal with, particularly the hiding/stealth mechanic. Although the hiding actions and movements are flashy and very cool, it's a bit stressful and difficult to position your character in the right way to be able to ambush enemies. I have found myself accidentally moving out of a hiding spot and getting spotted by an enemy more than once. However despite this, I feel like all of the other positives of this game definitely make up for the minor inconveniences.I personally also love games that allow me to appreciate and like most of the characters (or at least the cast of protagonists), and although I will admit that I am slightly bothered by the voice of one of the characters, I generally enjoy all of the characters' voice acting, personalities, and backstories. I thought some of the characters would fit into generic tropes, and although they did fit into tropes a bit, there was still some more added flavor and depth to the characters to avoid making the characters to bland and predictable.Overall Persona 5 has been crafted to fulfill the needs of many types of gamers, and I, as a casual gamer who usually plays games for likable characters and great stories, am very pleased and invested with this game, and I am excited to fully complete the game and unravel more of the story. This game is definitely worth trying out.\"

This is a fantastic return for the series and one I have been eagerly anticipating since it was announced several years ago.Graphically it stays true to the established style Persona has had for the recent iterations but with the gameplay graphics nicely updated. A new addition thanks to the updated graphics allows for 2 different kinds of cutscene in game now, one using the graphical models and another using the traditional animated scenes.The music is once again composed by Shoji Meguro and yet again he has not only pulled off some beautiful tracks but they fit in perfectly with the games style and theme.Gameplay wise the combat mechanics follow on from Persona 4/Golden with some slight changes, additional elements have been added in the form of nuclear and psychic attacks, and light and dark have been given damage based offensive skills instead of the old chance of instant kill moves. Physical attacks have been altered, bringing back the piercing attacks from older versions of Persona/SMT games. Outside of combat, the new dungeons have been overhauled massively, this is probably my favourite update to the gameplay, previously dungeons were almost entirely randomly generated, now they are consistent (except for mementos which is still random) uniquely designed and well designed. A semi-stealthy style to traversing the dungeons has also been added, initially I was concerned this would enforce avoiding combat but instead it is implemented in a manner that encourages using the environment, being observant of the map and your surroundings, it also fits in with the theme of the game.The day to day mechanics are much like they were in Persona 3/4, the previously named social links are now confidants, work mostly as they did before but as with Golden where benefits to your team mates were added for progression, every confidant now has bonuses, some of which are incredibly useful and make them feel far stronger towards your progression in the run up to completing them.While I don't want to compare your party members to previous titles, I do feel that they are well written and even those I struggled to like initially grew on me whereas in 3-4 I don't remember having that issue. The story is well written and enjoyable, pacing can at times be a small issue but that tends to happen in really long games like this.Overall this has been a great return for the series after an 8 year break since Persona 4 came out, I hope that this will see Atlus work on more titles in the Persona series at a faster pace.If this is your first Persona title, it makes for a great JRPG title, a genre that has been sadly lacking in recent years and I hope you enjoy it. If you are a returning fan like myself I hope you, like I, found it worth the wait.\"

All of the persona games are precisely about correct time management, It is entirely possible to max everything on the first play though if you play it smart, or follow a walk-though. If you waste time, or spend it ""incorrectly"" within the game, you can still finish the game, and probably even reach the true ending but you will most likely not be able max out all of your social links and stats within one play through - and that is not an issue, that's the whole point of the game, that is why this is a ""strategic"" JRPG, veteran persona fans will be able to testify, that in the older persona games, your time limitations were much more strict and maxing out everything was even harder.All in all 10/10 game, absolutely worth your time, and a lot of it!.\"

Persona 5 brings me back to my childhood days of playing the classic JRPGs of the snes and psx era. I couldn't recommend this game more to anyone who enjoys playing RPGs.
2017,Persona 5,As someone who has never played a persona game I am in love with this one as it is one of the absolute best games I have ever touched and the best game on ps4. People wen't lying about how good this one was.

2017,Persona 5,"I've never played a Persona game and my coworker (who has played all of them) convinced me to get it. I'm so happy i decided to give it a chance because this is the most immersive and interactive, traditional RPG I've played! I would spend hours talking about it, but I will just say BUY IT and you won't be disappointed!"

My only nitpick with the game is that there are less non-plot related moments with the characters like in Persona 4 like the camping trip. Moments where they aren't worrying about the overall story and just character building. The plot of 5 fits fine with the lack of these moments and the theme works without them so its a matter of personal preference.One of the best if the best JRPG of this generation. If you are a Persona fan or just a fan of story heavy games, go buy it right now.\"

Along the way you build stat upgrades which you can use during your dungeon crawlingThe story, dialogue, voices and character interactions are very good, making it an addictive game where you want to level up and progress to further the story. The story also involve real world topics that deals with mature themes such as abuse, crime, rape, blackmail-GraphicsVery stylish with its anime art design/cutscenes, jagged comic book speech bubbles, very colorful backdrops and varied characters personalities . Even the UI has a stylistic flare to it. All transitional screens and menus are well animated. Very nice presentation overall as it looks very slick, edgy and modern.-Gameplay:In the metaverse, you sneak through palaces and stealth hit/ambush wandering enemies for a leg up in battleOnce battle is initiated it's your typical jrpg turn based system but with a twistIf you hit an enemy with move that's super effective against them, you'll get an extra turn to attack until your combo gets large enough where you get an optional all-out-attackAn enemy can sometimes do an 'Hold Up!' prompt where you can spare their life for money, item or have them join you as a Persona summon.For the latter you get a multiple choice question answer segment where you have to convince them to join you with a successful choice dependent on the enemies personality. You can then fuse personas and make stronger onesOnce a palace is conquered you are not able to return, but you can get mementos or side quests from random NPCs to further level up if you want toIn the real world there's a lot of micro time management. You may be overwhelmed with activities that you cannot do all in a single day and some activities are only open on particular days . Thus you have to pick and choose what to do to build up your stats (like eating burgers, reading on the train station, studying, watching movies, etc) or build relationships with a friend. For the latter, building relationship further increase their persona in battle and similar persona types that you capture/make join your teamAll activities level up 1 of 5 stats: Knowledge, Charm, Guts, Kindness, or Proficiency. These stats once leveled up open new activities and opportunities to level up in the meta-verse and improve social links furthering the story.They're a lot of interlocking game mechanics in play that the tutorial may last you a couple of hours depending on how familiar you are with the series. Even though the game handholds you for a couple of hours, it's very natural and you don't feel lectured most of the time. After those few hours, you get invested very easily as the world opens up to you, and you can easily sink in 100+ hours into this game.Overall best Persona Game I've ever played and for those who like a narrative driven story where a lot of your own choices predicts an outcome, this game is a must buy.\"
2017,Persona 5,"Persona 5 is a game that draws you in from the very start, with it's eye catching intro and catchy soundtrack, to the very slick looking menu, you know that what you're in for is a treat.Atlus have managed to reconstruct a game which is apart of series that has been going for 20 years now and keep its authenticity as well as introduce it into the current generation of gaming.MostPersona 5 is a game that draws you in from the very start, with it's eye catching intro and catchy soundtrack, to the very slick looking menu, you know that what you're in for is a treat.Atlus have managed to reconstruct a game which is apart of series that has been going for 20 years now and keep its authenticity as well as introduce it into the current generation of gaming.Most developers feel the need to change things accordingly to keep up with their competitors, but Persona 5 manages to keep its own identity by changing nothing mechanically in comparison to previous instalments, a trait some would deem risky or out dated, yet once you indulge yourself into the world of Persona 5 and become immersed into what the game has to offer it's like rekindling all that enjoyment and excitement that originally made you fall in love with the JRPG genre.Atlus continued to use the cel shading aesthetics which look incredible on either PS3 or PS4 (4k is not supported) and it gives that authentic anime look to the game. These games however have never striven or relied on its looks but how well they play.After 140 hours of game play and a current second run through I felt I could give my honest opinion on the game.Firstly after 140 hours I have encountered absolutely no bugs, not even graphical glitches, which has been a rarity in gaming lately. There have been reports of frame drops, but as I'm playing on PS4 (and PS4 tend to lock a vast majority of games at 30fps) it's safe to say I haven't encountered any frame drops.The battle system is basic and easy to use and a big improvement on Persona 4's look wise and control wise, in fact the game menus themselves are really well designed, I've never known a game developer to put so much effort into the design of the menus... As for the battle menu, now all the options are mapped to specific buttons rather than operating as a selection list.Battle animations are good especially the successful 'All-Out-Attack' animation, and the ability to swap persona's without it using a action is less frustrating also.The characters and social links you obtain throughout the game have their own personal battles very similar to the main protagonists, and it is up to you to help these people on the way creating important bonds. The social aspect of these games have been an important role throughout the series, it makes the game so much easier the stronger your bonds, and you get the sense of achievement when you're able to wield strong personas as a result.Game wise it took me about a good 6 hours (after my first mission) to get the full interaction of roaming around Tokyo, however it did take me 120 hours to complete my first play through, so 6 hours from 120 is 1/20 of the game and it was worth enduring it as the first 6 hours are crucial to get an idea of what to expect and familiarise yourself with how to operate within the game.Persona 5 has been one of my best game purchases in the last 15 years easily, and I haven't put as many hours into a single game in such a short amount of time for at least a good 20 years, it is THAT good.Atlus have done themselves just, but then ruined it by implementing a streaming/PS share ban..... However I think an action disregarding how just or unjust it was, shouldn't shadow what has been a great game and a certain contender for Game of The Year.\"
2017,Persona 5,Had the time of my life while playing this game. Persona 5 is by far one of the best games i have ever played and is definitely the best JRPG that has been released in a long time. Persona 5 is pretty much perfection and It is hard for me to imagine any other JRPG coming out anytime soon that will equal it.
2017,Persona 5,"Been into the series since Persona 3 on the PS2.

This is a fantastic return for the series and one I have been eagerly anticipating since it was announced several years ago.Graphically it stays true to the established style Persona has had for the recent iterations but with the gameplay graphics nicely updated. A new addition thanks to the updated graphics allows for 2 different kinds of cutscene in game now, one using the graphical models and another using the traditional animated scenes.The music is once again composed by Shoji Meguro and yet again he has not only pulled off some beautiful tracks but they fit in perfectly with the games style and theme.Gameplay wise the combat mechanics follow on from Persona 4/Golden with some slight changes, additional elements have been added in the form of nuclear and psychic attacks, and light and dark have been given damage based offensive skills instead of the old chance of instant kill moves. Physical attacks have been altered, bringing back the piercing attacks from older versions of Persona/SMT games. Outside of combat, the new dungeons have been overhauled massively, this is probably my favourite update to the gameplay, previously dungeons were almost entirely randomly generated, now they are consistent (except for mementos which is still random) uniquely designed and well designed. A semi-stealthy style to traversing the dungeons has also been added, initially I was concerned this would enforce avoiding combat but instead it is implemented in a manner that encourages using the environment, being observant of the map and your surroundings, it also fits in with the theme of the game.The day to day mechanics are much like they were in Persona 3/4, the previously named social links are now confidants, work mostly as they did before but as with Golden where benefits to your team mates were added for progression, every confidant now has bonuses, some of which are incredibly useful and make them feel far stronger towards your progression in the run up to completing them.While I don't want to compare your party members to previous titles, I do feel that they are well written and even those I struggled to like initially grew on me whereas in 3-4 I don't remember having that issue. The story is well written and enjoyable, pacing can at times be a small issue but that tends to happen in really long games like this.Overall this has been a great return for the series after an 8 year break since Persona 4 came out, I hope that this will see Atlus work on more titles in the Persona series at a faster pace.If this is your first Persona title, it makes for a great JRPG title, a genre that has been sadly lacking in recent years and I hope you enjoy it. If you are a returning fan like myself I hope you, like I, found it worth the wait.\"
2017,Persona 5,"This is my first Persona game and I don't know why I waited so long to play one! It's been so long since I've sat down for six plus hours, just playing.

The exploration and combat is very enjoyable and a big improvement from previous Persona titles. The design of each castle environment is really well-thought out and almost reminds me of Zelda Windwaker Dungeons, but much darker.

The characters are all extremely likeable and relatable in their own ways, and the overall writing of Persona 5 is wonderfully executed. The plot explores so many different themes throughout each of its story segments, and each to fantastic and interesting effect.The English dub is utterly fantastic as well. Aside from the obvious Japanese influences and setting of the game, it would be very hard to tell that these weren't the original voice actors for the original release.The game world is brilliantly stylized. Everything from menus, to text boxes, to the chatter in the city streets, is done with such a brilliant and interesting style. A truly beautiful game. It's hard to put it into words until you see it yourself in action.The combat and persona system is brilliantly executed as well. I've never been interested in turn based combat, but there's something about Persona 5's imagining of it that kept my interest high at all times. The visual style of the game is possibly at its strongest here. Everything from the list of available actions, to the persona selection screen, and to the XP screen, are all brilliant. I never got bored of it throughout my 100 hour playthrough, and i still want to go back for more in New Game Plus. Persona 5's combat feels extremely active and exciting considering it's turn-based, and the heavy style of every small little aspect just helps to accentuate this.Pair the fantastic story with characters with an addictive set of gameplay mechanics and a beautifully stylized world, and you have yourself a brilliant package overall.Persona 5 goes above and beyond with its polish, as well as the obvious love and attention to detail that the developers have poured into this game. This right here is a game that's absolutely worth the full asking price and more. The game has tons of great content, and i didn't encounter a single bug throughout the ENTIRE playthrough. The released DLC for it has also been cosmetic packs from previous Persona entries, as well as several persona's from past games as well. This is a complete package with some great DLC for fans of the series. I even bought a few dlcs myself because i have gotten more value out of this then i ever would have imagined.This is a game that deserves my support, and i'm so happy to be speaking such high praise about a game in a genre that i previously had no interest in.Give this game a try, even if you're like me and have no interest in JRPGs! I guarantee you'll fall in love with it.\"

The music and sound effects are equally amazing, and there is a free DLC pack available to give you dual audio for those who prefer Japanese Voice Actors.No matter how hard I try, I cannot think of a single complaint with this game.\"

It's as flawless as flawless gets for such a huge AAA game.With that said, I have a few minor flaws and issues that aren't bad ones, but still need to be mentioned, even if they only slightly undermine the greatness of this game and don't really harm it:- The pacing is terrible. 4 hours to get into the first dungeon proper and leave the scripted fights and tutorial zone? Please. By this point they should've gone for dynamic tutorials or slowly let the gameplay expand over the course of the 90+ hours of the game. Instead we get about 60% of the whole game's gameplay tutorialised and explained in the first 4 hours and while understandable, IT IS JUST WAAAAAY TOO MUCH.In general the game is slow as well, with characters talking all the time, and unlike Persona 4 they don't repeat themselves or waste your time, but they generally talk about the same things, conversations are fine but feel samey. I'm thinking they could have added events, or perhaps a new villain somewhere in the middle. The first dungeon serves as tutorial for the game, and the end has a lot of good plot dump, but in between there is certainly room for new story elements, and P5 is a little scarce on new things to talk about for the team. It's mostly a nitpick though, there is way enough story content, just slightly insufficient story content for all the talking and time spent.- The game's way too directive. When plot is dumped on you, usually over the course of a full week, you are forbidden from going out or doing any of the social links or side things, which is terrible. If I wanna get stuck on story mode and ignore the bountiful side content, I can do it by myself, I don't need the game to order me.- While more of a nitpick, P5 focuses on its main cast and story more than any Persona game. Like in P4 every team member is a social link, and because of the aforementioned blocking, P5 really wants you to focus on its main story and main cast. It's just a bit of a shame.- Now this is a very wierd thing to complain about, but playing Persona 5 till the end convinced me that the game was incredibly polished and thought out, but perhaps too much so. Wierd to complain about a game being too well done, but I think the extremely calculated and prepared nature of everything might have been a bit of a detriment. It lacks freshness, it lacks spontaneity. Like if IRL you meet someone and you just start a conversation a bit awkwardly, compared to a movie where the script is written in advance: P5 feels like all of it is extremely prepared, thought out and imagined, and it's fine in 90% of cases, but I wish they had used the last 10% to go and throw out some random/risky things, to just do whatever they wanted instead of calculating and evaluating everything like it feels they did.- Following on last point, while P5 strikes a great balance between the Phantom Thief aspect and the  more normal Tokyo life, and the atmosphere is a resounding success, I think they could have gone wilder with some of the cast. P3 struck an awesome balance between gloomy, creepy, or sad characters, crazy unrealistic(but realistically written) characters, and more normal people. P4 was all bore and normal. And P5 has quite a few good ""dark"" ish characters, and a lot of normal people. I wish they would have gone crazier, like what happens with the maid reveal. Moments like that are pure gold and they could have gone out on a limb and tried more crazy stuff like that, it would have made this too-calculated game even better.I guess they knew this was their chance to reach a much larger public than their usual crowd, so they played it a bit too safe.Still, those nitpicks shouldn't take away the fact that the **** gameplay from older games is utterly crushed, the story is great, the characters are great, the game is pretty much perfectly written despite a bit lower key points around the end, the Tokyo life is awesome, the feeling you get from the whole game stays strong from start to finish, and it has a lot of extremely good and memorable moments, along with a kickass soundtrack and one of the strongest visual identities in all of gaming.\"

This may just be a convention of early game, but as a person picking up the series for the 1st time; it's well appreciated.Like I stated above; never played a single Persona game up until this. There is a nebulous sea of J-RPG's out there and myself and this series never crashed together. For me J-RPG's end up being socially jarring (American here), so the nuances of the game(s) are odd or awkward or mirror the same tropes every other J-RPG has done. Persona 5 does this, yet also bridges a gap that makes the product palatable and genuinely likeable; even when dealing with a hairy guy wearing nothing but a crown/cloak and pink speedo's.There's the art style which has already been talked about by everyone, but I would add that perhaps a better camera control could have been included. It's not god awful, but it's also a tad under satisfactory for my tastes. It makes taking in the world around a little poor and I wanted to see more than a tunnel-like view (perhaps a cinema-like option). The controls are fine though I would have liked a walk/run option. Having to use the very delicate joystick for it isn't great but i've dealt with worse. The music is J-RPG common fare, but it feels a lot like being swaddled in a comfy blanket. You know they are crafting a feeling to make you at ease or uncomfortable. Earworm quality is the best term for me, the music bores into your mind, which is fine by me I enjoy the soundtrack. I have caught myself humming the battle victory tune while doing things in real life.I've enjoyed my time so far. Solid game with a lot of things to get attached to.\"
2017,Persona 5,This is for me the best persona I've played hands down. After 50 hours in I still get impressed by the story development and gameplay elements. If you liked persona 3 and 4 you are sure to like this one.
2017,Persona 5,Nowhere near done but truly one of the best jrpg's ive ever played. Perfectly executed. The art style the combat everything is so engrossing. Top of the list for 2017 for sure.

The game also has a great storyline with tons of clever twists and unexpected turns. When I say this though keep in mind that I am mainly speaking about the plot itself because some of the characters (mainly the males) are just not that likeable, have some questionable lines, and one of them in particular is downright weird as a a character. That said that is about the only major complaint I have with game. The combat is fast, fluid, and flashy. It has so much style and it truly does capture that feeling of making you and your team feel like badasses. There is so much complexity withing comboing moves with different personas and there is even 4 different ways you can handle an enemies fate if you can stun all enemies on the field are once. I truly do believe all other turn-based/party-based games should take note from this. The dungeon design is some of the best I've ever seen in games period and it complements the combat greatly. They give you a feeling of truly wanting to explore these elaborate labyrinths the developers created. As if this wasn't all enough to sell as a game as is Persona 5 also has the whole other end of the gameplay spectrum where you live the everyday life of a Japanese high school student. You can work jobs, recreational activities with friends, shop places, study for school, and befriend/romance other characters within the game. This all on paper sounds incredibly boring but in practice it is the glue that hold Persona 5 as a complete package together. It's done with just enough a gameplay segment to feel like you did something but is gone and you are transitioning into another activity within moments. This all gives you experience in various stats that open gameplay options and make you stronger in the dungeon-traversal aspect of the game. It should be commended especially that there is so many different rotating parts and systems within the game that all interlock and complement each other perfectly. In the graphics department you are covered as well as this game comes with one of the best art styles I've seen in recent years and shows even with less photo-realism you can still create something beautiful to look at. This game really captures the feeling of playing an interactive manga/anime tv show with over 100 hours of content to delve into. This game came really close to a 10 for me but unfortunately about half the characters not being very interesting or likeable in a game that is about 50% cutscenes/text held it back from that kind of game for me. I also had very minor issues with the fact that some areas lock you into a fixed camera angle which can make interacting with objects kind of irrating (although it looks great during the platforming sections within the dungeons.) Overall though this is a must buy no-matter what if you are a true fan of story-based rpg's even with it's few niggling flaws nothing can hold it back from the things that it sets out to do it does all damn-near perfectly for the most part. When you are playing it nothing can hold it back from it's greatness, there is something about just playing it that feels so masterclass. It's the kind of game that just keeps you completely entertained and intrigued from start to finish. 9.5/10\"

Putting over 200 hours into the game has been a marvelous journey for me. Playing Persona 5 was like reading a colorful and stylish novel that engrossed me from start to finish. An emotional game that shows the spirit of freedom, and bonds that we make on others mixed with a badass turn based combat system that had made me always excited to fight in even after the hundreds of fights I have already done. The music is outstanding and is one of the best RPG and game soundtracks of all time for me now.The social sim mixed JRPG adventure has proven to be a wake-up call for me as a individual, as it has made me far more open and free whenever I play it. While this may sound sappy and increidibly cheesy, Persona 5 stole my heart. A charm that has not struck me this hard for a long time. Sure it has plenty of rough areas and with the restrictions Atlus placed on the game, its hard not to cry foul on why this deserves a 10. I honestly would not blame anyone who thinks Morgana is annoying, or the beginning starts off very slow and even turn off the game for how it handles time. But I think those that love a good adventure (with a decent story littered with great characters) will appreciate it.It's better to note that I have never played a Persona game, so as a newcomer who only heard about the series and playing this twice for a thorough experience, let me once again say this game is a (flawed) masterpiece that I enjoyed the hell out of AND see as a work of art that doesn't use beautiful landscapes or graphics to show it, but art designs, wonderful characters, snappy combat, outstanding music and addicting activities that puts Persona 5 in leagues above most games. Maybe I'm a Phanboy, but even with a few flaws I do find glaring, my overall enjoyment, emotional depth and cleverness by Hashino and his team proves Persona 5 is one of the best RPGs and games of all time.\"

2017,Persona 5,"Ever since I finished Persona 4 on the PS2 many years ago, I've been waiting for this game to come out and my expectations for this game were astronomically high. And, while I would say it didn't live up to that, the game is almost as perfect as I was hoping it would be. There are a few very minor issues that keep it from reaching the perfect heights that I had hoped for but nothing toEver since I finished Persona 4 on the PS2 many years ago, I've been waiting for this game to come out and my expectations for this game were astronomically high. And, while I would say it didn't live up to that, the game is almost as perfect as I was hoping it would be. There are a few very minor issues that keep it from reaching the perfect heights that I had hoped for but nothing to keep this from being the best JRPG to come out for a very long time and one of the best games for the current console generation.It begins and ends with the Story and, while it takes literally hours upon hours of gameplay to finally pick up steam, it has a very satisfying ending and final boss. The dungeons are a big key to that too as they are handmade instead of randomly generated like previous games. While some of them drag on a little too much, (especially one of the ending dungeons), they really set the tone for the game at that point and the bosses were very well designed.The characters are also very well done. There are a few standout characters, including the new ""mascot"" character in this game, Morgana. However, I'd still say that, as a group, Persona 4's cast was a bit more memorable but that might only be from the amount of time I've spent with that game. The voice acting is superb and not just for the main cast. The side characters are really well done too but that's to be expected. I'm a bit disappointed that there wasn't more VO's at some of the more important parts of the game, especially a few scenes at the end, but there's hundreds of lines of dialogue already. That might be a good idea for any kind of remake that will hopefully happen in the future.The combat is the same but they've added two new types of damage: Psy and Nuke. They've also added new Personas in the game, but the bigger story might be that they left some of the most controversial monsters in the game. Google the Persona ""Mara"" and you'll know what I'm talking about. However it was really cool to see some regular Personas like Jack Frost and Pixie in 3D. Plus the new Personas are very cool looking and not just the main characters. The party members have some amazing new Persona designs and it's probably the best collection or Personas so far I think. Special mention has to be made for the music too. The Persona series has always had some of the best music in video gaming and this game was an excellent reminder of that. It's one of the few series I'd pay to buy the soundtrack of and listen to it over and over again.There's one big caveat that I want to mention for anyone playing this game: it takes literally dozens upon dozens of hours to complete and it's not an easy game. This is not a series for beginners or people who don't like RPG's. However, if you can deal with all of that, you'll find a game and a series with a ton of heart and promise. This game in particular, while it took almost a decade to be released, shows that the guys at Atlas still got it. And with the way things went with Persona 4, I imagine we will be seeing a few spinoffs and, hopefully, a bigger and better remake in the next few years. Till then I'll be going back in into this world, albeit at a much slower pace.\"
2017,Persona 5,"This is literally the perfect JRPG.

I feel like I would have seen this on a system 5-10 years ago and I would wager a guess that this is intentional but as a noob it's painful to experience coming in without a background.Graphics:  Subpar at best.  It's got the anime feel down but it looks pretty old.  A lot of effort was clearly put into details but it's just not that great and maybe that comes with JRPG territory (expect graphics to look like they are from early generations of video gaming) 5/10Story:  Pretty bizarre but nothing special.  Again maybe it comes with the territory but the translation seems completely off, sometimes the speech and story just doesn't make any sense whatsoever.  I'm assuming in it's original form the meaning is likely drastically different.  At times the translator appears to read directly from an incorrectly translated script which is void of the meaning of what is being presented on screen.  Take what would be a 6/10 and throw a wall of button smashing text to get to any real action and you get a 5/10.Gameplay:  For what there is, it's not too bad.  Pretty intuitive though not very challenging. 8/10.Overall:  It's for those that love the style I think.  If you are used to the previous games then it's probably a blast.  If you are new like me, then it feels like a 30 dollar-ish game that you start and want to love but give up after the mind numbing button smashing for the next best thing (and on PS4 that's probably in a week or two).  I think it's a good choice in December when it's down to almost no price (30 or under) and you want a game to go back to when you are in a lull between your many other awesome PS4 games.   6/10\"

It's probably the most cathartic story Atlus has made for Persona, and by the credits I was filled with such a good feeling, one I rarely feel when I finish a game. 90 hours of this game and it definitely had its impact on me.The game breaks off a bit from Personas 3 and 4, and though it shares its combat system, the style and flair of it all has been bumped up to 11. The stylized graphics look amazing and the lights and sounds of battle feel so cool. Additional elements brought back from even before Persona 3 like nuclear and psionic skills make a comeback, and guns are brought back from the first game as an extra method of attack. In battle, new mechanics are added, such as the ability to corner enemies when you down them with their weaknesses, allowing you to negotiate with them for money, items, or even have them join your cause as a new Persona. Or you could skip that and initiate the normal all-out attack, cutting to a red background silhouette of you and your party tearing the enemy to shreds before finishing it off with a stylish cut-in. No doubt, the game has style points in spades.The day-to-day living aspect is standard Persona fare. You choose how you use your time, improving your social statistics by studying or seeing a scary movie, or hanging out with friends to increase their social links. The social link system is now called the Confidant system, though it's the same thing. However, there is more incentive to seek out these people and grow your bonds with them, as special bonuses can be attained through this method, such as the ability to give your extra turn after downing an enemy to them to follow up with their own element focusing on a different enemy to bring them down as well, or even giving you unique abilities such as the ability to instantly win battles through ambush on lower level enemies, or the ability to start out a battle after an ambush with a flurry of gunfire. As standard, the characters are very human, each with their own struggles and personality quirks that makes them fun to hang around, and they grow in character the same way you do.One thing changed is the fusion system, which is basically the same, but you're now able to choose which skills you inherit, taking out the frustration of having to deal with a random system that often doesn't give you what you want, which was borrowed from Persona 4 Golden. Borrowed from Persona 3 Portable is the skill card system, letting you acquire certain skills and grant them to any Persona you want. It feels more in-depth than in the old PS2 titles, and really lets you take hands-on control of the Personas you create.The dungeons have been changed as well. Instead of being the randomly generated dull hallways that P3 and P4 have, they are actually fully crafted levels to explore. Puzzles and platforming come into play as you navigate the unique dungeons, with variations of themes and navigation in each one. Jumping over chandeliers in one dungeon and crawling through tunnels in another, solving a complex lock system here and playing dice in the next. Each dungeon is unique in theme and method of solving, and they all are bright and colorful with lots to see and do.The music, as always, is amazing, with its own style and themes that are awesome to listen to, even outside of gameplay.The only real problem I have with the game is that it's hands down the most restrictive Persona game I've played. There will be whole weeks where you're forced to go directly home from school and straight to bed without being able to do anything all because ""oh, story, though."" These segments just feel so annoying and I find myself skipping through them just so I can continue actually doing things. You end up missing out on valuable time you could've been using going through dungeons or hanging out with friends or boosting your social stats and NO, MORGANA, I DON'T WANT TO GO TO F***ING SLEEP, I WANT TO GO OUTSIDE AND DO STUFF! WHADDYA MEAN I CAN'T FEED MY PLANT? WHAT, I'M TOO TIRED TO FEED MY PLANT?! ARGH!!Persona 5 definitely feels like its own game, recognizing what made the others great and running with that, adding its own unique style and streamlining many clunky aspects of the previous titles. Persona 3 and 4 are amazing games, and Atlus definitely had those in mind when making Persona 5. The game is stellar, and is an easy contender for Game of the Year.\"

Demon negotiations from the mainline SMT games are also added, making acquiring new personas a little challenging.-There are tons of content in the form of side quests, social links and collectibles.Persona 5 is a modern JRPG masterpiece that I would put in the same level as Chrono Trigger, Xenogears and FF6. It's definitely my favorite game for this year. It's an absolute must play for MegaTen veterans and for open minded new comers who'd like to try a modern JRPG.\"
2017,Persona 5,"Summary:Overly verbose script, unsteady tone, uneven character development, and limited changes to core mechanics weigh down an otherwise lovable sequelPreface:I\m a huge Persona fan, and I like Persona 5. A lot. I\ve spent over 140 hours playing since the Japanese launch.That said, as much as I like Persona 5, I don\t love it to the degree that I expected to or wanted to. TheSummary:Overly verbose script, unsteady tone, uneven character development, and limited changes to core mechanics weigh down an otherwise lovable sequelPreface:I\m a huge Persona fan, and I like Persona 5. A lot. I\ve spent over 140 hours playing since the Japanese launch.That said, as much as I like Persona 5, I don\t love it to the degree that I expected to or wanted to. The uncritical praise with which the game has been showered with, left me feeling like I should speak out.As I\ll be focusing on what I didn\t like, I\d advise readers to think of this as a companion to, and not a replacement for, the many positive reviews out there.Music/Presentation/CombatAbsolutely Excellent.Graphics:While the graphics are serviceable, and the beautiful art style helps to create a compelling world, the inability of the 3D models to convey convincing fascial expression is problematic. The 2D portrait art during dialog scenes is nice, but feels like a crutch. Such a distinctly limited range of facial expression feels dated, even on the PS3. Somehow the game actually looks worse than Atlus\s Catherine, whose expressive faces somehow manage to outshine of Persona 5\s half a decade later.Gameplay:As I have a lot to say here I\m going to utilize a bullet point format to highlight what I feel are the biggest problems.1.	Dialog choices in social links still amount to nothing more than a simple game of choosing the correct answer to get the most points, with no lasting impact.2.	Freedom is often restricted and it gets incredibly old being told to just \go to sleep\ so you can listen to more dialog the next day, for days in a row.3.	No hidden characters, hard to access social links, colds, random events, and quite frankly, limited replay value as a result.4.	Poorly scaled difficulty with \normal\ being easy, while hard is absolutely punishing. Oh, and no trophy for beating the game on hard.5.	You can still date all the girls with virtually no repercussions, totally breaking the immersion. If Atlus could do it in Persona 3, there\s no reason that they couldn\t at least create a rational risk/reward dynamic for dating more than one person a decade later.Story:It\s not that the story\s bad (I enjoyed it a lot), but that it feels undercooked, features uneven character development, and is held back tonally by its predecessors while featuring poor pacing.The Script:The first problem is that Persona\s 5 script is incredibly verbose to the point of excess. Dialog, the majority of which is still text based, often feels repetitive, like a dog chasing its own tail. With better editing, I feel like the same story could have been told with around 1/3 less text.While hardcore fans may not care, this makes the game tedious at times, and much less accessible to newcomers.Perhaps the most unfortunate casualty of the script is that Hifumi Togo, a social link who was supposed to be a playable character, but had to be cut because the game was already \too long.\Character Development:For a game about building relationships, the social links for half of the main cast leave a lot to be desired. While Yusuke, Futaba, and, to a lesser extent Haru all have interesting arcs, Ann and Makoto are both bland, while Ryuji comes off as marginal at best.Still the game has a large number of reasonably strong and memorable supporting social links, which help to make up for this, although I\d still say overall quality isn\t up to Persona 4Tone:Persona 5 obviously struggles under the weight of the previous games. On the one hand, it wants to be dark and provocative like Persona 3, on the other, it wants to be fun and lighthearted like Persona 4. Unfortunately, by trying to have their cake and eat it too, the developers have created a game that is often (but not always) tonally flat.This is highlighted early on when a talking cat mascot joins your party (light hearted), followed by an attempted suicide (dark), to which characters react with a limited emotional range unbefitting of the situation (tonally flat).Pacing:A major reveal is made in what is literally the last 1-2 hours of the game. The story could, and IMO, should have continued for another 10+ hours, but instead just ends.Also, a certain someone\s research is hinted to be very important throughout the game, and yet by the time the credits role, the player still knows almost nothing about it.Conclusion:If you\ve made it this far, you might come away thinking I hated the game. I didn\t! I love the game in spite of its flaws, but have been annoyed by coverage which has just flat out glossed over them. I feel like with just a little more spit, polish, ingenuity, and time Persona 5 could\ve been one of the best games of the generation. Instead it ends up being a serviceable sequel to Persona 4, but so much less than it could\ve been.\"

Persona 5 is a unique experience if you've never played a Persona game before. Since it's been a long time since Persona 3 on PS2, this is probably going to be many people's first Persona game. So, I highly recommend this to people that are fans ofShould you buy Persona 5 (P5)? If you're a hardcore fan of the series, of JRPGs in general, or you really enjoy slice of life anime, then yes. Persona 5 is a unique experience if you've never played a Persona game before. Since it's been a long time since Persona 3 on PS2, this is probably going to be many people's first Persona game. So, I highly recommend this to people that are fans of video games in general because there're no games like Persona series.I played this game on a PS4 Pro with a custom hard drive. This minimized load times for me, but there were a lot of them. They were so short they didn't bother me however. I've finished the game at 110 hours, although you can finish in as little as 90 like my brother did.Lets give a critique by category:Graphics: Nothing impressive here. This is a game developed for the PS3 after all, ported to the PS4. The animations are worse than prior games. You character just stands there most of the game, occasionally doing a gesture. There are not facial animations at all. Even the character portraits when the character talks just have a mouth moving. They could have used several portraits for each character, like in past games/other JRPGs. The art style is fantastic and really carries the game however. There are very few object that have a model in game, for example, if I spend $100 on a gift for someone, it would be cool to see the gift being given. 6/10Music/Sound/Voice: You'll hear some really catchy tracks in this game. The music is by far the best in the series. The voice acting is top notch, my only complaint is that some of the voice actors used are a bit too familiar and I would have appreciated new voices I haven't heard before. The game lacks musics tracks for how long the game is, which is the case in every Persona game. The sounds effects are what you would expect, I thought they were great. 8/10Story/Writing: Here's where things turn ugly for P5. The game shamelessly follow a VERY similar structure to P3, which makes it boring to fans of the Persona series. From characters, to overall plot, as you go along, you'll see what I mean. The game also has less voice acting than expected and a lot of reading boring exposition in the form of text message conversation. The text conversations I mostly skipped through because it's small talk that just restates what the game has already gone over to death. There are some interesting characters and plot lines from the minor characters at least and the game rewards you with additional powers for spending time with the characters, so you are at least given incentives to go through the characters stories you may not like.There's so much dialog in the game between the main characters, I'm not sure if they needed as much as they put in. You will get fatigued reading unimportant day to day drivel that blows up your phone.There are more places than ever to go to than ever and while small, they all were interesting if you enjoy Japanese culture at all. There are also a ton of secondary locations that you can choose to take some of your social links to, which is new to the series and a great addition.It's not that P5 writing is bad, it's that there's too much boring dialog and that the overall story and characters too closely follow P3. This is a highly subjective category and doesn't weigh that heavily into overall score due to that. 4/10Controls: Not much to say here as it's a very basic game to control. The new stealth mechanics are obnoxious to control as the camera doesn't automatically pan to your next cover area like it should. This can lead to you accidentally unsticking from cover and getting ambushed. Getting ambushed by the enemy early on most likely mean you lose. 8/10 Which leads me to gameplay...Gameplay: The game can be fun often, but there are several niggling issues holding the game back. Namely they brought back some old school features that suck. Did anyone like that you lose a battle when your main character dies in P3? They got rid of that ""feature"" in P4, but brought it back here. You also got full mana and health by attaining a level in P3, but here you do not, forcing you to go back out of the main dungeons more often than you may want early on.The highly praised main dungeons are just okay. The puzzles are very easy and you are too often forced to fight more enemies than you would like do to the sticky cover controls being imprecise. Also, regardless of how high level you are, enemies will always chase you. In past games, if you were higher level than the enemy, the enemy would run away from you.The battle system is improved in that you can get some cool abilities that weren't in to old games. They also brought back guns and the ability to talk to Personas to catch them, both from Persona 1, which I thought was cool. The problem with talking to Personas is that it takes more time than the previous roulette wheel in an already long game. 7/10\"

It is addicting, but they shouldn't excuse of them of...What is wrong with the game?This should of NEVER left early access at this state, this game is still a unpolished disaster that has a ridiculous amount of bugs and glitches for a out of early access game.

The game is littered with cheaters but they have banned many of them so credit where credit is due.In conclusion, this game is fun, hell it's addicting as hell BUT lack of paying attention to game breaking bugs and them STILL being there in the 'released' out of early access version is horrid. If they can improve this game by optimizing it as well as paying attention to game breaking bugs, PUBG can go VERY far in terms of popularity within the community.\"

I got it for free because I took part in the Pre-Alpha that happened (I think) in July of 2016. Getting the game for free doesn\t affect my review at all (it gets nit and gritty towards the end).---For those wondering, why is this so familiar?- Well, because the person behind this game is PLAYERUNKNOWN (as stated in the title of the game). It\s his standalone game. He first started his Battle Royale work in Arma 2/3 as Mods. Than Daybreak licensed Battle Royale gamemode from him and they implemented that his game mode in their game called \H1Z1,\ later on they saw the potential of Battle Royale and they split the game into 2 games with one game that only has the Battle Royale game mode called H1Z1.What does BATTLEGROUNDS (PUBG) feel like?- It\s a mixture of Arma 3 and H1Z1, but more or less it feels like Arma (but not clunky) since it\s not arcadey like H1Z1 and it actually takes skill to learn. It\s not just about getting kills. It\s about surviving. If you like tactical\ness, outsmarting your opponent, a non-clucky engine like Arma 3 and just an overall fun time. This is the game for you. In Arma 3, it\s slow pace and walking everywhere, sometimes taking a vehicle. In H1Z1, almost everyone is in a car and if you get near someone they jump out (while the car is going full speed) and they try to shoot you. In this game, it\s medium pace, the vehicles in BATTLEGROUNDS will get you killed if you randomly jump out to kill someone at full or half speed.In BATTLEGROUNDS, you have servers where you can go Solo or find a teammate(s) in Duo and SQUAD, just like in H1Z1. Unlike in H1Z1, but like in Arma 3, if you team in Solo servers you will get banned. PLAYERUNKNOWN promised that Mod support would be coming at official release. But, Mod support is nowhere to be found in 1.0. They stated that Mod support to the point where you can create your own Battle Royale game mode (and publish it to the Steam Workshop), host it (maybe rent a server like in the Battlefield series) and have your own community or group of friends play it. Weapon-wise, all these weapons don\t have predicable weapon recoil, they\re all different, as well with the bullet drop/travel. Attachments like forgrips, compensators and more all can decrease the recoil and change the final outcome of the game when it comes down to that 1v1 at the end. You can\t use 3rd person shooting all the time, it\s not accurate as 1st person shooting (like in H1Z1, both 1st and 2nd can be used at medium/long).As I mentioned in the beginning, getting the game for free doesn\t affect my review at all. But because this is a review, I have to be unbiased and review all aspects of the game, even the company behind the game. I give the score what I gave it because of one issue. Due to the fact that the Community Manager/Community Team of the game, Sammie and FWG (go on my Twitter for that link/story). They were very disrespectful, closed minded and banned me on many platforms to censor me. I would have given this game a 9/10 if this situation didn\t happen/taken place.In the end, I\m glad PU made the Mod in Arma 2/3 and Daybreak licensed the Battle Royale mode from PLAYERUNKNOWN. He got rid of the clucky\ness from Arma and understood all of H1Z1 mistakes, downfalls, lack of communication/game updates and made his own game. And to be honest with you, this game is pretty bada** and worth the buy. I\m glad that I was able to see this game grow when when Pre-Alpha was going on. And let's face it, H1Z1 is still in Early Access just this upcoming January in 2018, it will be 3 years in Early Access... PUBG put H1Z1 in it's coffin.It\s one of those games that you will come back and play each day just because how fun it is, H1Z1 (or other BR related titles) can\t do this.---My Review Score: 8/10\"

Other than that, the only reason to play it is to become a pro (Although I can't see it taking off as an esport as it requires too many players) or if you are trying to become the next big streamer. I personally always found it quite boring to watch and hopefully so will the rest of the gaming community.it's plagued with cheaters and bugs, it's poorly optimised and running on awful servers. And on top of all that, you spend more time looking for vehicles and chasing the play area boundary than actually fighting other players. I understand the need for the shrinking play area, but it's poorly executed and results in players dying just because they can't find a vehicle. Meanwhile the players lucky enough to be in the play area to start with can camp and pick off weakened players as they desperately try to stay in the game.\"
2017,PUBG,"As people have pointed out in other reviews, the game can actually be pretty fun. The underlying game play is good, and the maps are pretty well designed (all 2 of them).

The underlying game play is good, and the maps are pretty well designed (all 2 of them). However, the game suffers from 2 huge problems that the ""official"" reviewer playing a couple of hours total might not notice. First, it is STILL incredibly buggy. The biggest problems are random lag spikes, stuttering, and a few outright crashes, which is exactly what you DON'T want in a competitive shooter. The second big problem is the large number of Chinese players on the North American server. Why is this a problem? For one thing, they don't speak or understand English, so teamwork (which is kind of essential in squad play) is simply impossible. And when I say a lot of Chinese, I mean that in 80% of the squad games I've played, the other 3 players were all Chinese. The other problem is the large amount of cheating that occurs in the game. I'm not 100% sure it is the Chinese players, but considering they seem to make up a majority of the players on the North American server, it seems impossible that they are not. If they can simply fix it so that people in China automatically ONLY connect to the Asian server, this would be an 8/10 game. Until then, best to stay away.\"
2017,PUBG,"I didn't understood the hype but I gave it a try anyway. Played it for a while and couldn't warp my head around it. It gets boring really fast and you just doing the same thing over and over again. There's no variety of things to do. It just feels like a mode, not a full game."

However, this game was RELEASED as a paid game to the public in a very ALPHA state.The shooting mechanics are broken and if you're coming from ANY real shooter you'll be frustrated that bullet registering is non existent. The net code is very bad, and you'll frequently die from lagging thru the terrain or unable to pick up anything from the ground. You'll warp and rubber band around.If you do manage to survive, odds are you'll be killed by someone with a string of random numbers for a name that aimed at you across 10km and instant headshotted you. They don't do anything to prevent hackers like any real competitive game.Overall, its fun at first, but then you'll grow to quickly resent the game when you spend 15 minutes just picking  up items just to die and do it again because of game engine problems.What's worse is that the developers have made it clear they arent focused on fixing any issues. They will not introduce region locking and the North American server is just all Chinese players which completely defeats the purpose of having a team game (can't communicate with any players). Also, lag favors the person lagging since hit registration etc is client side, so the same overseas people intentionally choosing a bad server for them will kill you before you can even see them on your screen. Besides this, the developers have already been forcing paid loot boxes down our throats before fixing ANY issues.Don't waste your money on this game, support developers who actually work for a living.\"
2017,PUBG,This game was not that good. i found it to be just messy and just not fun. i think fortnite did a better job when it came to distinguishing itself and less buggy. I also found it was just not as good as people said
2017,PUBG,This game has way too much lag and server issues.  It is updated often but I can't get past the fact that it's only popular because a bunch of streamers caught on to it.  It's more of a fad game that will fade away and not be remembered.  I ended up refunding this game after a few hours of playing.
2017,PUBG,"Seriously after selling millions of copies they can't even improve a bit the game?  Bad graphics, awful optimization, isn't original at all. IS A ****"
2017,PUBG,"Its great game to play online or could be. Its 03.2018 and game is still broken, you can still die just by explosion of your bike on road or other physics glitches. And what devs doing with that? They giving us emots! freakin joke.  e-sport ready my ass. LOL"
2017,PUBG,"Everyone is hacking / cheating to ruin the experience for everyone else and the majority of them don't get banned. If all the cheaters were banned, half the playerbase would be banned. You can just do a quick google search and bam, tons of premium hacks available that you can buy, that don't run on your computer, the makers say, run a VPN and connect to our server, you'll never be banned.Everyone is hacking / cheating to ruin the experience for everyone else and the majority of them don't get banned.

Every single match ends with, someone knowing exactly where I'm going to be and lining up a head-shot minutes in advance, because they see every player position on the damn map with their hack.

2017,PUBG,"Developers cashed out and are no where to be seen.. are you guys even working on the game anymore ?  do not waste your money on it, they say out of early access ?? yet still full of lag, glitches and bugs.. makes for some funny YouTube videos but impossible to play - congrats .. cant wait for the next update that gets us.. absolutely no where."
2017,PUBG,"Register at metacritic just for this comment:2 things ruined this game completely:1) cheaters, many, many, many cheaters2) wery, wery, wery bad network code - you hit enemy 5 times??? - Hah, no, enemy already killed you 2 sec ago."
2017,PUBG,"While pubg isn't bad, it surely isn't great. I have enjoyed my time on pubg, but EFT's style is much better. Basic and buggy, just like most games these days. I am truly shocked how many people got sucked into pubg.. I will play it more, but it isn't great."
2017,PUBG,A game that looks nice on the surface until you realise that in at least 50% of games you will just die to some hacker who a. knows where you are b. can hit you with every single bullet and c. has no recoil. The game runs fine and I have no issue with lag at all. It's just worthless because its not at all fair.

So, you have that sort ofOh man, if you like buggy garbage that is only hidden and never addressed fully, you've come to the right place. First, lets look at the developer: A social justice warrior snowflake that cries about being bullied and then blames users as being racist because they inquire about region locks to keep out the Chinese hackers (which the game is infested with). So, you have that sort of brow-beating lecturing crap from the headshed right off the bat. Performance wise, you have a tic-rate of no more than 17 causing horrendous server performance because, guess what, they developed it on the Unreal 4 engine with too large of a player base for it to handle. That being said, Fortnite runs the same engine and same player numbers and is at least able to run a stable 18 tic rate. When I said 17, I meant you'll basically cross that threshold, re-cross it, and then cross it again in what will amount to a graph looking like the skyline of the Himalayan mountain range. Instability. But oh man, you finally got that one game that runs alright, and things are finally looking up! Oh but the loot crate hoarder from Asia with a 400ms ping speedhacks up to you, kills you with a recoil hack, and then speeds away with your loot. Even when your buddies shoot at him to avenge your death, the client-side only hit detection gives him the advantage with a high-ping and they can't hit him either. ""Git good bro"" is the SJW's recommendation. You report SpeedyHackerino to the SJW, and your report is looked at 5 months later, as you notice the email is finally sent to you notifying you of such. A 3 day ban is awarded, and SpeedyBingBing is back at it. Hardware bans are racist says the SJW as he laughs while shopping for a new **** on Amazon with your money, soon after coming over here to MetaCritic to pay for that artificial reviewer score of 85.I'll give this game one point for concept. I'll give it another for potential, and even another for the small glimpses of actual fun that can occur when you're not being plagued with server performance issues, hackers/cheaters, or hearing the developer run his mouth about how your opinions are morally wrong in between forging one-eyed purple headed warriors with his chocolate starfish.\"

Armor does nothing.7. Cannot remap keys8.  Cars make a a stupid sound despite the fact most cars are not heard these days9. Blue circle which contracts is an idea but would be better executed by contracting zones by area (e.g if 30 players in one area blue circle contracts for those 30 players only  while another zone with 20 player contracts this way the groups fight till there is 1 player or team in each area then the circle gets wider again for 5 minutes then recontracts at a central stage.10. They should use two sets of planes (set a and set b) (set a sets off along line x while set b sets off online y) - This would allow more players to potentially find each other and actually have mid range fights around cover , which doesn't happen in this.This game is not a shooting game its a RNG collecting game where you collect x loot and go wow i got this , this and this and then cry cause it taken away by 2-3 hits where you have no idea where it come from. Game badly needs indicators to at least give players a fair chance at actually shooting there gun.Good with others bad alone.  It gets boring picking up loot to engage in no action what so ever cause someone else got a sniper rifle and a 4x scope and you got an uzi and no scopes.\"

We appreciate the active participation of all players in coming forward and reporting the bugs and glitches in the game so that our dev's can fix them. It really means a lot to us!Fortunately, our dev team is aware of the particular issue that you have reported and we plan to fix this issue in a subsequent future patch.Thank you for your patience and understanding. We hope you continue to support the game.--------------------------------------------------------------------------So at least the support staff was prompt and polite. As of posting this however, the problem is still occurring. Neither player unknown battleground or steam would refund the money which was unethical as it was a fully released game that was effectively unplayable.I might come back to the game once the bugs are fixed and will rerate at that time. End of the day the devs rushed a beta into production just to be front of the races for the battle royale craze and they did it on the backs of a lot of unsuspecting gamers who paid $40 for a nun functional game.\"

It could do without the hackers, Chinese and weird damage values, but it is definitely worth getting if you have friends to play with. I am giving this game a negative review because of the fact that the developers are slow to fix issues even though they definitely have the funding to fix them. It could also do without an awful lead dev who will call his North American player base Xenophobes and defend cheaters for ridiculous reasons.\"
2017,PUBG,This game still needs work. Why is it at times i can empty a clip into some ones head they turn around and hit me once and kill me. Sometimes its hard to pick up guns and other things i have to keep walking back and forth over them to pick them up. Lot of glitches in scenery and game play. And its not my PC its way more than good enough to play this or any game.
2017,PUBG,"The only way to enjoy this game is with a team of friends in first person. You can play it in a team of randoms, but the average player is 9 years old so I wouldn't recommend it.

You can play it in a team of randoms, but the average player is 9 years old so I wouldn't recommend it. With a team engagements are more tactical and someone from the team will always be able to spot an enemy team, so reflexes, aim and angle of engagement become important. It's also easier to find high power scopes and lvl 3 armor with 4 people looting, which are extremely important to survive, and the best strategy is being very aggressive. That's a good thing.Solo, it's a nightmare. Luck plays a bigger part while looting, and camping is the only viable option, due to the absolutely massive advantage of being able to hear anyone that sprints in like a 50 meter radious while being locked in a room 3 buildings away, which is complete nonsense. You just blow up anyone that gets too close, they have no chance, and the same will happen to you once you have to relocate. Every match ends with a faceoff between the people who randomly camped at the place closest to the last circle area and didn't have to relocate too much, where they just run into the last circle area, usually in a field somewhere, and the guy with the biggest scope on his Kar98 wins. It is a complete waste of time.So yeah, if you have a team of friends and can coordinate your play times, the game is worth picking up. Between servers lagging, different things breaking on different days due to how the servers are behaving that day, and people crashing randomly, you might eventually get a 20 minute match that is uninterrupted and smooth for everyone. That one match will be fun. In any other case, stay away from the game.\"
2017,PUBG,Game is ruined by Chinese cheat creators collaborating with the developers to avoid cheat detection for a share in profits. 95% of games are filled with Chinese hackers no matter what server you play on.

Now the newest Zelda game is finally here and puts players back in Hyrule where theyThe Legend of Zelda\s prolific, seminal history has been striking the hearts of players across the globe for three decades. Attachment fans have with the series has withstood the test of time thanks to its immense and vibrant world of Hyrule, memorable characters, iconic set pieces, composition, and more. Now the newest Zelda game is finally here and puts players back in Hyrule where they must protect the kingdom from the ferocious evil that is Calamity Ganon after being asleep for 100 years. Breath of the Wild breaks out of a lot of classic Zelda traits, while instilling new ones and simultaneously making the world and game familiar for veterans, as well as accessible and eye-opening to new players alike. Breath of the Wild is unlike anything we\ve ever seen before, not just for Zelda standards, but for gaming as a whole.From the moment you get out of your slumber, you\re invited into the stunning portrait of Hyrule, painted in an exotic green, with the perfect blue hue of the sky and red rays of the sun. It doesn\t take long before you\re on your own and adventuring out into the wilderness, trying to recollect who you are and find your way back as a noble swordsman like you once were.Breath of the Wild\s map size is huge. Really huge. The gigantic portion of the Great Plateau in which you begin is only a spec on the massive open world you\re put into. However, despite the size, it is surprisingly easy to find your way around thanks to landmarks and other cues that guide the player through the story and where they need to go next, but that doesn\t stop you from going off, exploring, and climbing wherever you please \ or even going straight to Ganon if you so choose. It\s quite remarkable how Nintendo was able to build a game so big yet so coherent without ever losing a sense of value or direction. Everything you do feels like it has a purpose, and even if it may not seem like it right away, there will always be something down the line that rewards you for your efforts in whatever it is you do and how you choose to explore. Side quests among other tasks all have a reason and aren\t there to artificially increase the longevity of the game. Every task, every quest, every action impacts you and Hyrule as you see it.Hyrule is your playground. Now that you have the ability to go anywhere and do virtually anything, you\ll have to be well equipped \ not only with a hefty amount of stamina to climb and run, but with equipment as well. Your weapons will deteriorate and inevitably break over time, which is why you should always be on the lookout for new ones, especially those that enemies drop. Sometimes you\ll feel like you\ve conquered a certain area because you see it as \the easy part of Hyrule\, only to get hit by a flame arrow seconds later that take nearly eight hearts off of you in one hit. Always be on your guard, and if you see your weapon is about to break, you can always throw them directly at an enemy for a critical hit for one last hoorah before having to switch (snap) over to another to defend yourself further. The same will apply to your shield and arrows, and each have their own attributes and strength, so carry whatever you feel is necessary. Even if something is of an extremely low value, when you don\t have much with you, it\s always good to take it with you just in case. I can\t tell you how many close calls I\ve had only to be saved by my measly low level laughable weapons thanks to throwing and headshots. A battle of wits will always conquer a battle of strength.Breath of the Wild introduces a new cooking system, and it\s an exciting mechanic to say the least. Those familiar with creating recipes by combining various materials gained from monster parts the items scavenged throughout the world in Monster Hunter will have a lot to look forward to. You can take just about any five items in your inventory and throw them into a cooking pot, and chances are it will make something worth having. I\ve noticed, however, that combining elements that make the most sense will give you the most reward. It\s no different from cooking in real life. Vegetables go very well with other vegetables, but sometimes meat will complement the dish as well. Maybe you\d like a nice steak with a side of carrots? Go for it. You\ll gain ten hearts for that alone. Or maybe you\d want to go the seafood route and cook some salmon with suateed mushrooms? Go for it. That\ll restore fifteen hearts and give you a temporary stamina boost as well as an increase in cold resistance. It\s all left up to the player how they want to cook, and with enough food to make the world go round, the possibilities are endless. Every dish will provide you with something useful, even the extremely gross ones.This game is just simply stunning and amazing! Game of the Century. Called it here (first).\"

I can't wait to see what they will do with the next Zelda title and where they take the games direction this time.\"

El juego te da la oportunidad de hacer lo que quieras y es algo jamas visto, marca un antes y un despues. Jugablemente es preciso y precioso. Gracias Nintendo por estos juegos."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"The fact that there are so many people hating, giving zero instead of an appropriate score, only shows how the excellence of this game is disturbing. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is the best game in gaming history so far, already surpassing Ocarina of Time as the highest critically rated game."

2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"This game is probably one of the games that will never die; it seems timeless. Nintendo for sure know how to get their fans excited, and it is never disappointing."
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"I'm absolutely blown away. Games like this come once every decade. Everything we had hoped for and more. I was very concerned at first, as Nintendo kept delaying the game. But damn was the delay worth the finished product. An incredible and immersive open world. Funny, lovable characters. Excellent combat. I'm about 6 hours in and the game is starting to  get quite difficult. You'll noticeI'm absolutely blown away. Games like this come once every decade.

Funny, lovable characters. Excellent combat. I'm about 6 hours in and the game is starting to  get quite difficult. You'll notice this once you can leave the Plateau and are given free reign to travel wherever you want. I got absolutely wiped out by the Guardians patrolling the field in front of the castle. I'm gonna explore the world more and more, before committing myself to the main quest. I really love how this game gives you freedom that is lacking in most open world titles. I don't think that I've been this struck in awe since the days of Ocarina of Time on N64. Bravo Nintendo! Way to prove that you guys are still the best in the business. I give this is absolute 10/10. A perfect game for the greatest video game franchise of all time.\"
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"This game is amazing and on the grandest scale ever seen on a console based game.The artwork is amazing, the gameplay draws you in, and the concepts are completely innovative and jaw-dropping.This is truly one of those games you must play before you die."

2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"This is a game that takes the best aspects of gaming goliaths such as The Elder Scrolls, Dark Souls, Portal, and Assassins creed, then mixes them up in a cooking pot with the traditional Zelda games beloved by so many. The result is a game that can rival the near perfect, polished game that was Ocarina of Time. While not truly innovative (but let's be honest, innovation of a concept is farThis is a game that takes the best aspects of gaming goliaths such as The Elder Scrolls, Dark Souls, Portal, and Assassins creed, then mixes them up in a cooking pot with the traditional Zelda games beloved by so many. The result is a game that can rival the near perfect, polished game that was Ocarina of Time. While not truly innovative (but let's be honest, innovation of a concept is far less important than perfection of that concept), Breath of the Wild brings together dozens of mechanics and systems, both new and old to the series, and blends them all seamlessly to create an intuitive and exhilarating experience that few games can achieve. With so much content and so many ways to tackle that content, this is a game that can keep people enthralled and immersed in the world of Hyrule for dozens of hours with its simple but deep combat system and its fantastic platforming and physics puzzles. While this game is nothing short of a masterpiece, there are minor flaws. It's voice acting is often flat and due to the open nature of the game the story doesn't feel like a pressing matter. The former never really detracted from the experience, but it certainly didn't enhance it, while the latter is simply a tradeoff for the wonderfully open world where players are given enough freedom to make a libertarian blush. The last complaint that I can make and have seen other people make is about framerate. Nintendo does not make strong hardware, they never have, and Breath of the Wild pushes that hardware to the extremes sometimes, resulting in chugging framerates and sometimes even complete pauses in gameplay in the most stressful of situations. This isn't due to poor coding or an unoptimized game (see any Bethesda game), but is due to a hardware limitation fully out of their control. To complain about the game's performance is to complain about the hardware, and because these slowdowns hardly detracted from my enjoyment of the game I can look past them. Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a game that brings together so many amazing things from so many amazing games and blends them seamlessly and intuitively. I cannot articulate how intensely I believe that everyone should play this game. This is the defining game of this generation and if you enjoy RPGs in any capacity this game should be right on the top of your list to buy.\"
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,Everything in this game is just brilliant and amazing. I've played it for the past day and I just love exploring the map. There's so much to do!One of my favorite things to do is to slide on my shield and flying off ledges
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"It's quite funny to see how many people can't stand getting a game a highscore because it isn't available on their platform of choice, It's a huge problem of Metacritic that every **** can rate a game they probably just have seen in a 30seconds commercial. Will I give Horizon Zero Dawn a 0/10 because some Sony Fans have nothing better to do than hating on this great game? No, as soon asIt's quite funny to see how many people can't stand getting a game a highscore because it isn't available on their platform of choice, It's a huge problem of Metacritic that every **** can rate a game they probably just have seen in a 30seconds commercial. Will I give Horizon Zero Dawn a 0/10 because some Sony Fans have nothing better to do than hating on this great game? No, as soon as I'm completely done with Breath of the Wild I will play Horizon Zero Dawn on my PS4 and hopefully enjoy it too. Gosh grow up kids, this is getting ridiculous here.I have to admit, I'm not a huge fan of Open World games and if you are also not a fan of those you probably might end up enjoying Breath of the Wild less than previous games of the franchise. Don't get me wrong, I also play open World games but beside of bugs that are always present - which is kinda fascinating because I haven't seen a single bug in Breath of the Wild, yes it has some slight framerate issues, but nothing that makes it certainly less enjoyable - there are always things that could have turned out better in a less open world. For example Red Dead Redemption (for me a 8/10): it's huge Wild West world is great, has a lot of atmosphere and the story is pretty nice, but - not mentioning other flaws here - a stronger focus on the story would have me pleased more. Sure there are also examples where an open world IMO simply works, but that's mainly because it doesn't get to big which is kinda an issues in most modern open world games, bigger is not always better. Well, Zelda IMO doesn't have these problems, there is always something to do, being it enemy's, something you can hunt, NPC and so on... getting to your goal you might pretty much always find something interesting that can distract you if you wish for it. For it's enormous size it's surely an amazing world, it feels like it's breathing... living and way less like an simple scenery you have to complete your quest in. You don't need quest to enjoy it, but while there are is an enormous amount of smaller sidequest, I wouldn't have mind to have a few more main quest, be it as it be if you can enjoy yourself in a huge sandbox you most likely will love this game. The two biggest issues I have with this game are for once the story, I know you don't have to expect to much from a Zelda game but I have fallen for their trailer and expected that they would finally give us more, this game breaks pretty much all conventions this series has in the last 30years so why not? Yeah... don't expect to much, but if you have seen the trailer you will already know a good chunk of what there is available in form of cut scenes... I surely would love a Zelda game following the events that happened a hundred years ago... unfortunately Breath of the Wild doesn't give me enough to fulfill my expectations. The other issue I have with this game is that it kinda lacks of being ""The Legend of Zelda"", probably I would give it a 9.5-10/10 for being the best Open-World game out there but it wants to be a Zelda and with that in mind you might end up disappointed about all those broken conventions , IMO they took it a little step to far. It wouldn't have hurt the game if all the shrines weren't solvable without Items you HAVE to find in a Dungeon or somewhere in the world, those always have added variety to the Zelda games an I simply miss it, there is a good chunk of shrines but you can solve them all with the functions of the sheikah-slate (and a bow), needing a hammer/boomerang/magic rod which you can find in this world wouldn't have hurt but as a Zelda fan I would have wished for a few big dungeons with ""unbreakable"" Items to find and use in those shrines. Don't get me wrong, those Titans are pretty close to a Zelda Dungeon (beside the bosses not having a certain week point due to the lack of special Items) but just four of these in these BIG open-world wasn't enough to satisfy my thirst for ""The Legend of Zelda"", hell not even Hyrule Castle is a god damn dungeon, why Nintendo? WHY?All in all Breath of the Wild is an amazing Open-World game and on it's own it outshines similar games - while you shouldn't expect a story driven RPG as The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt of course - but as a Zelda it comes a bit short in terms of having big and complex dungeons in which you can get lost for hours, well at least you will find yourself exploring this world for a good chunk of time even if you intend to walk pretty straight to the Titans and beat Ganon.\"

You can see explosives inside the cave also but how to detonate them if you don't have any fire arrows? There are couple ways: there is a bonfire nearby and you can fire your arrows and shot the explosives or you can see a fire lamp right inside the cave and you can shot it down with regular arrows. There are so many different ways to accomplish the things and you feel extrimely satisfied when you find out the right way!Atmosphere, battle, controlls, I like everything so far.\"
2017,Zelda: Breathe of the Wild,"A return to form for one of the most beloved franchise in video game history. The open world is stunning, interesting and entertaining. Probably the best Zelda ever and maybe the best game ever."

Just from the size and activities to do in the first zone, I can tell this is going to be a very long adventure.It looks beautiful, it SOUNDS beautiful (man, all the footstep noises and weapon clinks and detailed sounds are amazing), it feels great to play and it feels open. The only thing to say negative about it is, of course, the frame drops. But that alone is certainly not worth docking a point for. (Especially when the other big brand consoles can't even achieve 1080p@30fps with their current games.)Worth your time, regardless of whether you are a ""Zelda fan"" or not.\"

I've waited five years for this game and throughout each delay, i knew it would be worth it. Sure, the conventions may have been broken and we have a new layoit for the Zelda series, bt Breath of the Wild is in every way, the way Zelda was supposed to play from the beginning. The gameplay is astonishing, the voice acting is not problematic, and the story is quite the thing to unfold. I understand that there are fears in this games huge open world, but fret not, its full of so many things to do. From the beginning the Breath of the Wild was always focused on this expansive open world. It doesnt force exploration, rather it encourages exploration. In fact, you have many open choices from the beginning. You can go face the final boss right from the start if you feel so inclined to.Breath of the Wild is a true thing of beauty and is worth anyone's time. We only get so many games like this every once in a blue moon. With all that in mind, Breath of the Wild deserves a true 10/10.\"

They're insecure that the new Zelda game is leagues above their new exclusive, Horizon. These aren't paid reviews. This game is really this good. Allow me to elaborate.In almost every 3D Zelda, you're put on a liner path that progresses you through the game. While they still incorporated aspects of exploration, they lacked the formula that was present in the original Legend of Zelda. This game puts you through a short tutorial in the beginning and then lets you wonder off. No hand holding. Hyrule becomes your kingdom to explore. The game has also implemented a quest system that is similar to Western RPGs. There is a main story quest and a bunch of side quests. There are also over 100 mini dungeons known as shrines which feature puzzles that greatly vary in design. The gameplay is quite similar to  Dark Souls/Shadow of Colossus. Certain enemy hits will completely deplete your health. Guardians will absolutely destroy you at the beginning. The music is very subtle and its ambience allows you to enjoy the sounds of nature that echo throughout this game. This game is a masterpiece. It scored 98 for a reason. Ignore the user score. Like I said earlier, it's being flooded by insecure Sony fanboys who are upset that this scored way higher than Horizon Zero Dawn.
