"Playstation Official Magazine UK","100","There simply isn't anything else like LBP on any system, anywhere. It's a beautifully elegant and powerful creative tool that puts unlimited potential in the palm of your hand. [Nov 2008, p.92]"
"Maxi Consolas (Portugal)","100","LBP is a unique game. It disguises itself as a 2D platform game but surprises the players with a set of editing tools and level sharing absolutely amazing. With a distinctive style and an everlasting future potential, we can say that Sackboy already conquered this industry. [Oct 2008]"
"Gameplayer","100","LittleBigPlanet is like a magic trick, and in that respect it feels less like a videogame than an incredible concept executed perfectly. LittleBigPlanet is like LEGO (the blocks, not the game), it’s like Monopoly, it’s timeless... it’s lightning in a bottle – and if Sony play their cards right it could well save the PS3, and propel the console into the stratosphere."
"Total Video Games","100","Undoubtedly one of the finest games in recent years, LittleBigPlanet deserves every single shred of a 10. You won't find a more polished or rewarding videogame this year, and for quite some time we'd imagine."
"GamePro","100","There's really nothing I can say other than this: if you own a PS3 and you don't buy LittleBigPlanet, you are robbing yourself of one of the most unique gaming experiences ever designed."
"Edge Magazine","100","It’s a multiplayer riot, a visual landmark, a feat of engineering, and one of the most charming games ever made. But even those accolades are dwarfed by its scope, its potential, and the apparent endlessness of them both. [Dec 2008, p.76]"
"G4 TV","100","It’s so satisfying to finally have a game that not only lives up to the hype but exceeds it so many ways it’s almost unfair."
"Kombo","100","LBP is one of the most important games to be released this decade. A tall order with the hype machine running overtime for the game but the way it reinvents how video games are played is sure to have lasting effects indefinitely. It is impossible not to fall in love with all the charm LBP oozes."
"Game Revolution","100","Little Big Planet is just what Doctor Sony ordered: universally appealing gameplay with an appealing everyman hero that is connected to streaming delivery of new content. Sony should be lauded for such a gamble, and Media Molecule should be praised. This is a rare toy that has the capacity to inspire the inventor, the explorer, and the gamer."
"1UP","100","Yes, it's the most charming game that I've ever played, and it's one of the most enjoyable. But the real beauty of LBP is even less tangible: creative empowerment at its finest and an unparalleled motivator to want to create."
"ZTGD","100","Consider the purchase of your PS3 more than justified."
"Gaming Age","100","LittleBigPlanet is a beautiful, happy, extremely eye-pleasing game that will put a smile on anyone's face who plays or merely watches it. Like Sackboy himself, it's impossible to not find the game both attractive and aesthetically pleasing."
"DarkStation","100","The best game I’ve played all year. It is an extremely fun platformer with stunning graphics not to mention the most extensive level creation tool I’ve ever seen."
"The A.V. Club","100","When Sackboy drifts into freefall while skateboarding down a steep incline, that sinking feeling in your gut means that the game's exquisitely tuned physics are working."
"D+PAD Magazine","100","LittleBigPlanet is gaming’s equivalent to YouTube: an unprecedented channel of collective talent that offers a level of creative freedom never before seenin a commercial videogame. It does for the platform genre what Half-Life did for shooters and what Gran Turismo did for racers; injecting innovation into a rapidly-staling genre and paving the way for the future of the side-scrolling platformer."
"Thunderbolt","100","LittleBigPlanet is much more than simply a game or even a tool, it’s an experience. The sack people are an infectiously charming bunch and as soon as you’ve settled in you’ll want to stay for the foreseeable future."
"TheSixthAxis","100","A stunning, powerfully confident title that deserves all the praise it’s ever been awarded, the Media Molecule guys should be so pleased with what they’ve managed to accomplish and just as much good feeling goes the way of Sony for putting so much faith in the game and getting behind it 100%."
"Giant Bomb","100","When it's at its best, LittleBigPlanet offers excitement and the thrill of discovery in ways that no other console game ever has."
"Gaming Nexus","100","Media Molecule has created an amazingly fun and deep game that will allow people to create their own games and explore the creations of others."
"DarkZero","100","The developers should be applauded for creating a profoundly personal work that still overtly appealing to the audience at large. But even though it is not the best platformer out there, the game can quite easily be classed as something entirely original for the genre, casting off a brand new tangent filled with wondrous sights and provocative ideas that are enchantingly imaginative and creative enough to be considered truly exceptional."
"Playstation: The Official Magazine (US)","100","It's too early yet to declare a new era or direction in gaming, but LittleBigPlanet feels like the birth of a revolution; like through sharing our collective creativity we'll somehow become better, stronger, closer to each other. [Holiday 2008, p.56]"
"AceGamez","100","The online community is brimming with endlessly different styles of maps, as each of the creators' personalities are poured into the fun of constructing them. LittleBigPlanet will undoubtedly keep you up at night, constructing the next big hit for the community - and if you don't care for that then you can still play the plethora of maps being produced by countless others."
"Electronic Gaming Monthly","100","Yes, it's the most charming game I've ever played, and it's one of the most enjoyable. [Dec 2008, p.72]"
"Cynamite","100","Little Big Planet is something for everyone. Inventors enjoy the extensive level editor, friends of action-packed Jump & Runs enjoy 50 levels. Still, the biggest fun is to explore the planet together with friends."
"Playstation Official Magazine Australia","100","I think the fact that you can go to sleep dreaming of a game, thinking of not just gaming but creation, breeds new life into an industry that is already known for its creativity. [Christmas 2008, p.62]"
"Eurogamer Portugal","100","LittleBigPlanet is effectively “The Next Big Thing” in the videogame’s world, a game where the imagination, the feelings, the cooperation, friendship, beauty and genius are hand in hand."
"WonderwallWeb","99","One of the most original and fun games yet on the Playstation 3, it is going to take something very special indeed to better this."
"Game Chronicles","98","LittleBigPlanet is a fantastic platformer game that many people are sure to love with its wide variety of elements and content. Level design may not be for everyone but you are sure to have plenty of levels with the community as well as those in the game."
"IGN UK","97","It’s a celebration of inspiration and human interaction and a hugely welcome, utterly invigorating experience among usual roster of nihilistic shooters jostling for shelf space this Christmas."
"MEGamers","97","The single player game alone is worth the price of admission. It offers a level of detail and value that no other game on the market right now can match. The multiplayer game adds a whole new dimension to the game. The editing /level design sections have to be seen to be believed."
"PSM3 Magazine UK","97","The game PS3 was waiting for - fun, richly creative, and truly fresh. [Dec 2008, p.60]"
"PSX Extreme","97","Media Molecule has created a game that'll go down in videogame history as one of the best gaming achievements ever, and you'd be extremely foolish to pass this up. There is absolutely nothing out there that can give you this much bang for your buck."
"GameZone","97","LBP has managed to do what few other games have – it breaks demographic barriers easily. LittleBigPlanet is a robust game that is huge in concept, with endless replayability and a real sense of joy."
"PGNx Media","97","LittleBigPlanet is one of those games that seemingly comes out of nowhere and redefines what you think is possible in a videogame."
"Gaming Target","97","This is a gaming achievement, not only for its sharp gameplay and beautiful visuals, but for its vast create-a-level mode as well."
"Computer and Video Games","96","You'll look for inspiration for levels, mechanical dilemmas or puzzles in every corner of your life. And in your sleep. It will take over your conversations with fellow players. You will become obsessed. You have been warned."
"Games Master UK","96","An amazing achievement and every bit as intuitive and addictive as we'd hoped. [Dec 2008, p.62]"
"HellBored","96","What is a simple fact is that this is a must purchase if you own a PS3. My local retailer has entirely removed its ‘Coming Soon’ section for the PS3 so there’s nothing to wait for. This is, by far, the best game on the system and certainly a serious contender for game of the year."
"Meristation","95","Little Big Planet is revolutionary thanks to its flexible, fun and powerful editor. Creating a quality level takes time but the feeling of achievement is overwhelming. A must for everyone who loves creativity or likes to explore what the creativity of a passionate community can produce."
"IGN","95","Media Molecule has created a brilliant platformer, and then given you the tools to recreate the whole thing over again, or better yet, to create your own ideas from scratch. It's not perfect - the controls could be tighter, automatically shifting between planes can be problematic, the editor isn't quite as robust as you might hope - but what's there is nothing short of astounding."
"PTGamers","95","LittleBigPlanet is a rarity, able to conquer even the bitterest of players. Its identity is one of a kind, it plays in familiar but exquisite ways and the creation tool is a never-ending discovery of possibilities. It's only a platformer, sure, but it's everything we should expect from one."
"Playstation Universe","95","LittleBigPlanet is innovation at its finest. It’s beautiful, hilarious, completely unique, and incredibly fun. You can’t afford to miss it."
"TotalPlayStation","95","This game belongs in every single PS3 owner's collection. It's that good."
"Game Informer","95","LittleBigPlanet is a gaming epiphany – one of the rare titles that opens new horizons on the landscape and changes the way you think about interactive entertainment."
"GameFocus","95","There’s a ton to do in LittleBigPlanet, this is one of those games that is quite literally hard to describe because it’s hard to choose what to say first about it. Between the levels provided, the complete customization, and user created levels, this is one LittleBigPlanet that will capture the hearts of millions for a very long time."
"PALGN","95","Fantastically creative, wonderfully cute, and most of all splendidly fun, LittleBigPlanet reminds us of what 'play' is all about."
"NZGamer","95","LittleBigPlanet is just one of those instances where a brilliant idea - a product of the times - combines with smart, polished game design to create something that should be a marker for things to come."
"Console Monster","95","LBP delivers in just about every way promised. It brings some solid platforming gameplay combined with some seriously impressive creation and community tools. If you own a PS3, you should get this game."
"Game Over Online","95","So if you’re looking to do some playing, creating, and sharing this holiday on your PlayStation 3, I totally recommend picking up LittleBigPlanet."
"DailyGame","95","This game is a true delight, making us point proudly to our PS3 and say ""THIS is why I play video games."""
"InsideGamer.nl","95","LittleBigPlanet is the culmination of every aspect ever associated with the term ‘next-gen’. The game revolves around fun, but also impresses from both an artistic and a technological point of view. The endless possibilities it offers in terms of playing and creating, mixed with the cute Sackboys and ultra-hip overall look, turn LittleBigPlanet into what could very well be a milestone in gaming history."
"Vandal","95","LittleBigPlanet is already a milestone. Never before had a game have such a user content creation focus, nor had offered them such solid yet simple to use tools for achieving it. This risky Sony project has survived and surpassed the hype, becoming a very great game."
"Play UK","94","LittleBigPlanet is certainly more difficult to master than we first imagined, but it pays off on its promise and then some. Media Molecule has created a game that deserves to take the world by storm, and this really is just the beginning."
"GameTrailers","94","LBP lives up to its promise of playing, creating, and sharing. It’s a strong 2D platformer that darts into the shadow of trouble once in awhile, but it’s ultimately redeemed by its daring design."
"Gamer 2.0","94","While LittleBigPlanet’s launch may have been a bit rough with the recall and such, the game itself definitely lives up to the hype with a very enjoyable story campaign and has almost limitless potential in the level creator tools for the community aspect of the game."
"Worth Playing","94","LittleBigPlanet is a fantastic game. It's a great platformer with incredible artistic direction and sound, and with some great gameplay to back it up."
"Play.tm","93","LittleBigPlanet is one of the most inviting game world's ever imagined, the concept is a masterstroke, the implementation slick."
"Gamers' Temple","93","This is a planet that you'll want to visit time and again, and that will be different on each return."
"IGN AU","92","Where LittleBigPlanet stands out is in the genuinely amazing integration of deep, deep content creation tools and incredible variety of objects with a community mode that truly makes content exchange and rating not just easy, but practical and even essential."
"Cheat Code Central","92","The game is everything it promised and more: striking level design, great music, easy controls, addictive gameplay, tons of features and collectables, and amazing physics."
"3DJuegos","92","LittleBigPlanet is a triumph in every single sense of its concept, and brings almost everything we were hoping for. If Media Molecule polish its little gameplay limitations it is possible for this franchise to become another reason to buy a PlayStation 3."
"GamingTrend","91","Families will enjoy Little Big Planet because of the ease of gameplay and the four player co-op. Hardcore gamers will enjoy Little Big Planet because of the collection aspect and the user created content. Future game designers will love Little Big Planet because of the incredible level editor."
"GameShark","91","Play. Create. Share. These three simple words make up developer Media Molecule’s little big blueprint for a charming and unique game that wonderfully brings out the creative side in people. Apparently there are already plans for a sequel, but I can’t imagine how the developers can possibly top this."
"GamingXP","91","The idea around the Sackboy is great - and the gameplay also - easy and intuitive. A game for the young and the old, which can also be a competitor for the Wii."
"Eurogamer","90","We're just happy to see a flagship game for a modern system that's about running from left to right and jumping over things. New ideas are great, great old ideas are better, and LittleBigPlanet has both: it's the future and the past of videogames, rolled into one."
"Kikizo","90","A quantum leap in concept and design, and one which falls inches - nay, millimetres - short of a perfect score. There's no better reason to own a PlayStation 3."
"VideoGamer","90","LittleBigPlanet may well save the PS3 (if it indeed needs saving), it may be the most creative game of all time, it could well usher in a new era of user-generated gaming, and has a chance of bringing about a 2D platforming renaissance, but all those things are down to you. The game Media Molecule has created won't do these things alone, but if gamers create the levels we think they're capable of, we might be looking at one of the most important games this console generation has seen."
"GameDaily","90","It also has some of the best graphics and audio on PlayStation 3. All of the textures, from a sun drenched African landscape to Sackboy's realistic looking burlap skin look amazing, as do the various special effects."
"GameSpot","90","Little Big Planet is a novel, imaginative, and highly customisable platform game."
"Level7.nu","90","Little Big Planet could very well be a modern classic. Relying heavily on user content this game will only grow in splendor with time. The game does hold it's own though with great levels, beautiful graphics and fantastic four player co-op. A somewhat unrealised potential with regards to the controls and movement of charaters is the only thing standing in the way of a perfect score."
"LEVEL (Czech Republic)","90","A fabulous platformer game and powerful editing tools in one package. Creative players will reach heaven with possibilities this game offers, and others can enjoy fruits of their work.  [Nov 2008]"
"GameSpy","90","Truthfully, LBP is a game rooted in production and consumption. The experience is hinged upon consuming and collecting in order to expand your depth and range when it's time to move into conceiving and concocting. Not everyone is going to offer a vision for others to experience, but the revolutionary nature of LittleBigPlanet ensures that gamers worldwide will be enriched a little more each time they turn on their PS3s."
"Gamer.nl","90","LittleBigPlanet is one of the best and original games we've ever played. The gameplay is perfect in it's simplicity, because the game can be played with only a few buttons. And thanks to the brilliantly designed levels the simple gameplay never gets dull but instead stays fun and fresh. For both the casual and core gamer LittleBigPlanet will be an irresistible game. You'll even get a great editor, free of charge, Offering you tons and tons of extra things to do and to discover. You probably won't play a better game than LittleBigPlanet this year."
"Extreme Gamer","90","Little Big Planet is one of the years most stimulating games to be released."
"games(TM)","90","We may have seen level creation before, but LittleBigPlanet is a stirring glimpse of the future. It manages to be both curring edge and classic simultaneously, with neither quality stifling the other. [Issue#76, p.110]"
"Gamervision","90","It’s fantastic, fun, beautiful, creative, and unique—pretty much everything you would want from any game and everything you would expect from a game that came with so many months of hype and excitement. With unlimited replay value and potential, you will probably be playing it for months—if not years—to come."
"BigPond GameArena","90","In reality, LittleBigPlanet is a game with all the right ingredients - maybe just not quite the right mix."
"Boomtown","90","LittleBigPlanet is everything you could possibly imagine, stuffed into miniature craft based levels, and executed remarkably well, and although everyone is still getting used to the tools, there are some real gems available online already for the keen player."
"Gamestyle","90","LittleBigPlanet is a must have purchase for a system that needs more AAA titles in its library. As a PlayStation 3 exclusive, it's almost worth buying a system to experience."
"Metro GameCentral","90","Describing it as an online community arts program is possibly not the most enticing of descriptions, but it's nevertheless the most accurate."
"Destructoid","85","As a product, LBP is amazingly solid with firm foundations outside of minor movement issues. As an experience, LBP is immeasurable and defined by the community. Let’s hope designers keep designing and further the bar as the game grows older."
"Gameplanet","85","Sony's exclusive title shows potential, but it has several areas that need improving. It's refreshing to see a title that has such fun gameplay and amazing customisation options, and we're sure LittleBigPlanet will be around for a long time to come."
"Variety","80","Coupled with a robust sharing system that borrows the best elements of YouTube, LittleBigPlanet is less a game than a platform for making and downloading videogame levels. Ultimate success beyond a niche of wanna-be game developers will depend on an extraordinarily active community that gives everyone else a reliable dose of new creations. [*Note: All Variety scores are provided to Metacritic by Variety's Games Editor - Metacritic is not estimating here or on any other game review.]"
"Jolt Online Gaming UK","80","If you’re after a fairly intuitive 2D level editor with a vaguely disappointing platform game attached and it absolutely has to be on the PS3, we guess LittleBigPlanet will do. Just don’t believe all the hype."
"Armchair Empire","75","Having a continuous supply of new levels helps LittleBigPlanet remain fresh – there’s always something new to fool around with, even though there are plenty of half-assed levels out there."
