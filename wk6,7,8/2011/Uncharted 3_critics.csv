"Push Square","100","It's more than just the best entry in an outstanding series though - it epitomises the very reason many of us play video games. And that's its greatest achievement."
"Playstation: The Official Magazine (US)","100","Viewed strictly as a videogame, Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception represents the height of technical achievement--the state-of-the-art, if you will--for the interactive console experience. [Holiday 2011, p.49]"
"GamerNode","100","Uncharted 3 isn't quite as memorable as its predecessor, but that doesn't mean it isn't one of the best games to come out this year."
"DarkStation","100","With amazing graphics and groundbreaking gameplay Uncharted 3 earns its place among its predecessors and should rank highly with anyone who sits down to play it."
"Impulsegamer","100","Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception is not just a game but a true masterpiece in the gaming world which is a must have title for all owners of the PS3."
"Gaming Nexus","100","Even with some control and difficulty issues, Uncharted 3 tells a fantastic story and has graphics and gameplay to match. You can do no wrong in picking up Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception."
"Game Chronicles","100","Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception is the perfect symphony of interactive, cinematic, action-adventure; a crowning achievement in game design so amazing I want to replay the entire series from the beginning. This is the adventure of a lifetime and definitely a contender for Game of the Year."
"Game Revolution","100","One of the most technically impressive adventures you can find, matched with a detailed and unique multiplayer, all while making it easy for a newcomer to pick up and enjoy. Drake's Deception is why most gamers play video games-experiences that keep us awed and engaged, and extra content to keep us coming back for more."
"Digital Spy","100","Despite this minor gripes, Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception is a masterpiece and a strong contender for game of the year. Like its predecessors, it pushes the boundaries of what's cinematically possible in the medium of video games, and is a thrill ride from start to finish."
"Guardian","100","Uncharted 3, perhaps for the first time, represents what we all hoped games would eventually evolve into. Its production values are sky-high, and it puts you at the centre of a gloriously rich and irresistible world, controlling a character who is heroic, but also convincingly human. It's also mildly didactic, and feels less dumbed-down than any mainstream movie we've come across in years."
"Destructoid","100","Uncharted 3 jumps from one extraordinary set piece to the next, pushing the way a videogame narrative can be presented. Equal parts exhilarating and emotional, I can't say I have ever played a more perfectly paced game."
"PSX Extreme","100","All that can be remains to be said about Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception is that it both defies and defines everything a videogame is and should be. In that order."
"Games.cz","100","The visuals are breathtaking, the story is fascinating and the gameplay is never-ending. Uncharted 3 is like a fast-paced locomotive that cannot be stopped. The expectations were high, but Naughty Dog met them and even added an action-oriented frantic multiplayer. This third title clearly honours its parents, but as a child it does tricks with its pulsing vigour."
"Eurogamer Italy","100","An absolute masterpiece that deserves attention from any gamer out there. If you own a PS3 you can't miss it and if you don't... well, you should consider buying one just for Naughty Dog's latest product."
"Gamereactor Sweden","100","Uncharted 3 will make you laugh, stare and just watch the TV in shock and awe. There is no doubt about it, Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception is the best game of 2011 so far."
"Playstation Official Magazine UK","100","For the second time in succession, Naughty Dog has created a game that can claim to not only be the best on PS3, but also one of the best in gaming history...A visual, technical and narrative tour de force that takes the sky-high expectations of an entire community and blows them out the back of a jumbo jet, replacing them with more show-stopping moments than you could hope to find in a dozen other games combined. [Dec 2011]"
"TheSixthAxis","100","There's no question here: this isn't just the best Uncharted game Naughty Dog have made, it's probably the best PlayStation 3 game anyone has made – and I'm not sure what other praise I can offer."
"Gameblog.fr","100","Uncharted 3 has but one shortcoming: it's where we wanted it to be. To an exhilarating solo adventure, even though it's less surprising and a tiny bit less well-paced than the second episode, add in a gorgeous multiplayer offer that's well-crafted and well thought-out. Drake and his friends take us on a marvelous journey once more, but the formula may have found its own limits with this third episode, at least on this generation of machines."
"IncGamers","100","A stunningly constructed action game that puts the competition to shame. The quality comes not only from its individual elements, but from the seamless manner in which they're connected. Essential."
"1UP","100","In some ways, it helps to think of Toy Story 3 or The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King when explaining Uncharted 3. Similar to this third game, both films are satisfying final acts that deliver entertaining and unique stories with respect to their previous installments."
"Giant Bomb","100","The only thing that might surprise you about Uncharted 3's relentless roller coaster ride is that it doesn't advance the standards for video game action like its groundbreaking, mind-blowing, superlative-generating predecessor did. But it certainly does match them. There's a slight sense of ""been there, done that"" in the way this game hews so closely to Uncharted 2's masterful blend of puzzle-solving, parkour, and dizzying action scenes."
"PlayStation LifeStyle","100","The entire Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception experience comes together and delivers an unforgettable adventure rich with cinematic eye-candy, intense action sequences, and a multiplayer component that convincingly entertains."
"IGN","100","From start to finish, single player to multiplayer, this game sings. The characters, the graphics, the sound, the story – they're all top notch. If you're willing to skip Uncharted 3, be prepared to miss one of gaming's finest moments."
"GamePro","100","Overall, the combination of a robust multiplayer, a surprisingly compelling co-op adventure, and a thrilling ten-hour single-player campaign add up to a title that is, quite simply, a must-own"
"PSFocus","98","Words almost can't describe a game that nears perfection. And that is exactly what Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception does."
"Cheat Code Central","98","The pacing, storytelling, drama, and comedy roll together to give one of the most remarkably cinematic experience in gaming today. Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception simply raises a bar that didn't even need to be raised. But now that it has, we will never want to go back."
"Multiplayer.it","97","Uncharted 3 is the very best in the series yet, a true jewel that keeps  the player excited from start to finish. A visual masterpiece with a great direction and very compelling multiplayer experience.  Definitely a must buy."
"3DJuegos","97","The single player campaign is one of the most memorable off-line gameplays that can be experienced now, and its multiplayer modes are very interesting too. Uncharted 3 is definitely the best reason to own a PlayStation 3."
"Gaming Target","96","Gamers who experienced Nate's extraordinary journey to find Shangri-La in 2009 should recognize the familiar gameplay, but still welcome this new adventure with open arms and a Sully-sized hug."
"PSM3 Magazine UK","96","Confident storytelling, astonishing visuals and obscenely ambitious setpieces make Uncharted 3 the best of the series and an absolute must-have. [Dec 2011, p.90]"
"Vandal","96","The most solid game in the series and also a materpiece of storytelling, which raises again the bar of visual quality in consoles. It adds new elements to its gameplay to avoid aging, and provides a great multiplayer mode offering tons of options. A must-have for PS3 owners and one of the best games of the year."
"Gamers' Temple","95","Uncharted 3 delivers a compelling story and backs it with some great gameplay."
"Official PlayStation Magazine Benelux","95","For adventurers who prefer a stealthy approach, we have good news: the balance between shooting and taking enemies out with your fists is much better balanced this time round. Nearly every confrontation can be handled in various ways.  [Nov 2011, p.58]"
"Armchair Empire","95","Others have come close before (and Batman Arkham City is as close as it gets), but as one of the two or three best games of 2011, Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception defines what an interactive movie gaming adventure truly is and solidifies its place as the best PS3 franchise ever produced."
"MEGamers","95","It's the reason you have a Playstation 3. This is the second best exclusive I have played this year, Resistance 3 being the other one."
"Da Gameboyz","95","For fans of the series Uncharted 3 is a more than a competent and completely rewarding continuation of the Nathan Drake saga and worthy of a purchase this holiday season."
"Console Monster","95","Uncharted 3 will undoubtedly be compared to its predecessor, for the two standalone leagues ahead of their genre. The sheer level of intensity, played out in the most cinematic blockbuster action packed scenes to grace a gaming platform, with a surprising level of variety and detail that resonates development passion, then there's a wealthy multiplayer on top too!"
"Playstation Universe","95","Uncharted 3 sets the bar for adventure games, it's an epic journey that you'll want to relive over and over again."
"Cynamite","95","Uncharted 3 is a must have title for every PS3 owner. Seriously, buy this game."
"BigPond GameArena","95","As all sequels (or three-quels) should, this third outing significantly raises the stakes and is by far the most personal."
"GamingXP","95","Uncharted 2: Among Thieves is one of the best PS3 games around, no action-adventure could stand up to it by comparison – until now! Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception combines the good elements of its predecessor with some new, fresh features like the enhanced multiplayer in a stunning setting. The atmosphere and the story really capture the player's interest and will have them lost track of time. A great game – thanks, Naughty Dog."
"Machinima","95","If Uncharted 3 proves anything, it's that Naughty Dog may be the most versatile studio in videogames. Their ability to craft tightly paced cinematic action, lighthearted narratives, endearing characters, and paint it with technical wizardry is unparalleled. Every single aspect of Uncharted 3, including its surprisingly robust multiplayer, is staggeringly well-executed."
"Game Informer","95","Around the edges of Uncharted 3, there's the vague sense that things are a bit too pat, that it's all beginning to feel a little formulaic. You could draw comparisons to Call of Duty, another series that relies heavily on high production values and popcorn-movie bombast. However, Uncharted 3 still affects me, not only because it's such sublime fun, but because it's telling the tale of characters I have a real affection for."
"GameTrailers","95","Its near-perfect sequence of peaks and valleys demonstrates how restraint can imbue some moments with increased impact. It's a short campaign, but the multiplayer makes it worth the asking price.. Drake's Deception is one of those games that has something for just about everyone, and if you own a PlayStation 3 it shouldn't be missed."
"Everyeye.it","95","Uncharted 3 is one of the most incredible adventures you can ever live in a videogame. Storytelling, digital acting, tireless pace, and brilliant solutions to hide the linearity are there, as well as a dense multiplayer, to entertain any kind of gamer."
"Computer and Video Games","95","All of which makes this a big step on from Uncharted 2 in terms of visuals, gameplay and performance - but its biggest achievement is that, barring minor lapses, the threads are brought together into a superbly cohesive whole."
"XGN","94","Uncharted 3 brings a unique adventure that you'll never forget. We love the Hollywood cinematics, we love the gameplay, we love the graphics. The game can be linear but the fantastic storyline and the spectacular cut scenes will keep you going until the credits appear."
"AusGamers","93","Drake's Deception is driven -- like previous Uncharted games -- by the compelling and flawlessly executed story which is matched perfectly by the stunning visuals. Without doubt it's at the pinnacle of storytelling in video games. The puzzle solving is also a boon, intricate in detail with enough leeway to let you do all the thinking. It's a little disappointing then, that the shooting mechanics have the same shortcomings as Uncharted 2 and that it takes too long to get going."
"SpazioGames","93","Uncharted is still an incredible cinematic experience, but its own issues remain the same: limited interactivity, often too linear. Despite this, it's still one of the best adventure titles of the year, one you shouldn't miss. Multiplayer is just an add-on, but a very well crafted one."
"Videogameszone.de","93","The new Uncharted game offers one of the most entertaining adventures of all time. The animations, the characters and the story are well presented. You are going to feel like beeing the hero in a Hollywood movie. Also the puzzles of the game are brilliant. Some Uncharted fans will probably miss some innovations."
"Digital Chumps","92","A great game that should have been superb. The experience is tainted by several gameplay mechanic problems that just shouldn't be there for this third game in the franchise this generation. Ultimately the good far outweighs the bad, but I can't escape the notion that I feel that the full potential of this sequel was not realized."
"GameFocus","91","A well-written story, a thrill-ride, summer tent-pole film presentation, and a much more fleshed out multiplayer experience all add up to one of the best games we've seen this year. Naughty Dog has once again given PlayStation 3 owners a reason to fire up their console."
"Games Master UK","91","A polished visual treat, but quality competition means it isn't as outstanding as it once was. [Christmas 2011, p.62]"
"GamingTrend","91","Even with the plot issues the series has, Naughty Dog has done a tremendous job with Uncharted 3 and they should be proud of it.  It's an excellent game, and definitely one of the highlights of 2011."
"Gaming Age","91","Uncharted 3 doesn't make any huge strides over its predecessor, and might not be as technically impressive as the leap from Uncharted to Uncharted 2 was. But it's more of what made Uncharted 2 so damn good, and it's hard to complain about that."
"Playstation Official Magazine Australia","90","The characterisations by the actors is second to none and even though this tall-tale takes you to fantastical places and events, the script is never once unbelievable. You never feel like an outsider. If anything, you'll feel right at home, ensconced in the constant drama of this loveable cast of returning reprobates and reprehensible villains. [Dec 2011, p60]"
"LEVEL (Czech Republic)","90","Only a few camera troubles stopped us from giving Drake's Deception the highest rating. Uncharted 3 is without doubt the best PS3 exclusive game of this year. [Dec 2011]"
"Total Video Games","90","At times you're left with the impression that Uncharted 3 could have been bolder – the blueprint of success from Uncharted 2 has perhaps been adhered to a little too closely here. Beyond the slightly out-of-place gun combat and familiar box of tricks though, this third attempt is still a genuine innovator thanks mostly to an otherwise stagnant genre."
"Play UK","90","It's frustrating and deflating to have to admit it, but Drake's Deception isn't another defining experience on PS3. It's still fantastic fun in the most part and worth picking up, but overfamiliarity holds it back from true greatness. Sorry, Nate."
"Gamer.nl","90","Drake's Deception takes its time to shape a story, and the result is a game that really comes together in the second half. When it does, it's really spectacular and questions that have been lingering in the background are answered in interesting ways. If the exciting singleplayer isn't enough content for your liking, the multiplayer offers a fun pastime."
"GRYOnline.pl","90","It's an amazing game with an engrossing singleplayer campaign and a complex multiplayer mode that allows for months of fun. But don't expect a massive quality leap from Uncharted 2."
"Worth Playing","90","I could ask for better in the manner in which Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception gets rolling, but once the ride hits full speed, it never disappointments."
"The Escapist","90","A brilliant romp. The controls can be frustrating at times, but the overall journey is exceptional."
"Gameplanet","90","Uncharted 3 has the ability to elicit high excitement from its players through a tight and polished combination of gameplay styles, and through it's unmatched art direction. It's let down only slightly with a kind of shallowness, and a linear quality unbefitting a game of this quality. But these small niggles aside, Uncharted 3 will have players leaning forward through some of the best action sequences in gaming, and will be a favourite for both long time fans and those new to the series."
"DarkZero","90","It's a close call between Among Thieves and Drake's Deception to the crown of best game in the franchise, however I think the unpredictable twists that are woven into the fantastic story let the newest episode reach a new pinnacle and I recommend everyone to play it."
"PALGN","90","Multiplayer, both competitive and co-operative, has been genuinely improved and provides an exciting alternative for PlayStation 3 owners. At the end of the day, for what it lacks in complexity, Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception makes up for it in spades in delivering thrill and adventure."
"Level7.nu","90","The third installation in the Uncharted series is bombastic and looks simply amazing. The highly scripted gameplay doesn't feel as fresh as it used to and the story loses its focus about halfway in, but a surprisingly good multiplayer experience saves the grade."
"Eurogamer Portugal","90","With Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception Naughy Dog delivers another great adventure that reaches the quality standards of Uncharted 3, even surpassing them at certain times. However, it was expected a longer longevity and a reinterpretation of the structure of the game."
"GameSpot","90","This is a beautiful, cohesive, and, most importantly, fun adventure that cements the Uncharted franchise as one of the best around. More of a good thing is welcome here."
"Eurogamer Spain","90","The campaign can be a bit disappointing, but with Naughty Dog still inanother league, and with a great co-op and multiplayer, Uncharted 3 is a game you shouldn't miss."
"Meristation","90","Uncharted 3 is the seal to one of the best franchises of this generation. Packed with intense action scenes, as usual, the script is the most exciting we've seen in the series so far. The superb graphics allow the game to show incredibly recreated locations such as the desert of Arabia. The multiplayer is much improved, becoming a real alternative to the main game. The only problem? Not as good and surprising as the second game, and a slow beginning."
"Eurogamer Sweden","90","Following on the best game of 2009, Uncharted 3 doesn't disappoint. The action is even more over the top, the close combat is improved and the acting is amazing. The controls are a bit too loose though, and Drake's platforming antics border on being a parody of itself, but apart from that this is a real gem."
"GameOver.gr","90","Naughty Dog once again delivers a unique cinematic experience that has no equal. With superb graphics, unbelievable set-pieces, superb story telling and great characters, Uncharted 3 is a genre-defining game. Next time though, we'd like to see better shooting mechanics."
"Metro GameCentral","90","No longer just an imitation of cinematic blockbusters but an interactive roller-coaster of outstanding ambition, technical ability, and genuine heart."
"NZGamer","90","I may have come down hard on the story, but that's because I hate to see potential unfulfilled. Uncharted 2 remains my favourite, simply because I value well-realised characters above anything else. But if you're less of a fussy bastard than me, and if you want a game that will wow you with sheer spectacle and keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish, then get this game."
"Telegraph","90","Naughty Dog have rediscovered an art that seemed lost with those Hollywood adventures. Conjuring a Spielberg-esque bounce and flow, sweeping you along for the ride and, in Nathan Drake, offering a hero that's neither emo, arrogant or Shia LeBeouf. Just cocky, vulnerable and a bit handy at climbing around and kicking people in the head."
"Gamer.no","90","Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception's visuals are absolutely stunning, from beautiful and life-like surroundings to characters that look like they could walk into your livingroom any moment. And when Drake returns this time, developer Naughty Dog has perfected the balance between storytelling and gameplay. They've practically ticked all the boxes this time, and Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception may very well be one of the best games this year."
"Edge Magazine","90","The present console cycle is expected to last nearly a decade, and there will inevitably be developers advocating the need for more sophisticated tools. But just like Machu Picchu, the Pyramids and every other engineering marvel of antiquity, Uncharted 3 will stand as a reminder to future generations of gamers that enough problem-solving imagination can turn any old trowel into a magic wand."
"games(TM)","90","The puzzles are refreshingly taut, the design and scope bewildering and its conclusion a triumphant crescendo of storytelling. It's completely iterative, derivative and formulaic, holding few surprises during its eight-hour campaign, yet Naughty Dog twists these familiar tropes into an invigorating rush of agile gameplay and seamless cinematic spectacle, proving once again that Nathan Drake is without equal."
"VideoGamer","90","At its best when being guided by Naughty Dog's meticulous hand. It's a genuine adventure; strap yourself into the single-player campaign and it's a white-knuckle ride with some of gaming's most engaging characters. Uncharted 3's trivial flaws are buried beneath a tidal wave of big-budget spectacle, and a genuine narrative warmth far beyond most blockbuster titles."
"GamesRadar+","90","While it never quite reaches the highs of Uncharted 2, Uncharted 3's slick, relentless action, beautiful visuals and beefed-up multiplayer ensure that it stands well enough on its own."
"Joystiq","90","Moment to moment, it outshines just about every other game on the market, and while it doesn't exactly break the action-adventure mold, it fills it with such practiced substance that you don't really mind the familiarity of its shape."
"ZTGD","88","Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception is a fantastic game that should get even better when the aiming and shooting is patched. It's an absolutely worthwhile experience for anyone who loves the series or simply enjoys a heart-pounding adventure. Unfortunately, the pacing, puzzle segments and platforming just aren't quite as good as those found Uncharted 2: Among Thieves."
"Pelit (Finland)","87","Amazing visuals, solid gameplay and an enjoyable story - Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception has them all and then some. It's a great game that could have been a truly excellent one if not for some slight shortcomings (platforming and puzzles are too easy, too much shooting in the latter part of the game, last minute escapes start feeling old after a while...). Still, it's an experience not to be missed. [Nov 2011]"
"CD-Action","85","Uncharted 3 shines in every artistic and technological aspect and offers one of the greatest adventures in the history of gaming. It would be a mistake not to embark on it. [December 2011, p.78]"
"Absolute Games","85","The execution is flawless as usual. Backgrounds, animation, lighting,music, sound, visual effects are breathtaking, well-directedcinematics are peppered with snarky dialogue. It's a bona-fideHollywood blockbuster."
"Extreme Gamer","84","Uncharted's third engagement into the uncharted leaves another lasting impression. Although slightly underachieving in its innovation, Drake's magnetic pull for trouble provides another memorable adventure."
"TotalPlayStation","80","Were Uncharted 3 any other game, if it didn't hit with dizzying highs to offset the abysmal lows, it would be infinitely skippable. Instead, compelling (but difficult) multiplayer and enough ""wow"" moments mean it's worth seeing, but not owning."
"D+PAD Magazine","80","Despite its unquestionable quality however, the praise we can lavish on Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception is tempered slightly by a sense that the template might be reaching its breaking point and that even more treasure could be found with a little more diversity to accompany the astonishing moments of technical and cinematic wizardry."
"Wired","80","Those thrills, ripped straight from summer blockbusters, tend to be both Uncharted 3's biggest strength and biggest flaw...Drake's Deception never lets up on the action, and it has an obsession with constantly one-upping itself. Before the end of the game, you will have escaped from a burning building, outran a massive wave of water aboard a sinking cruise ship and traversed a seemingly endless desert...These segments are thrilling, heart-racing stuff, but predictable."
"Gamereactor Denmark","80","The production values are incredible. This is truly an amazing game to look at. This time around the story feels a bit more like something you could get away with if it was a tv-series - too many loose ends and not something that fits a game release schedule. Drake is still great to look at, and the multiplayer is a blast. And you know more than anyone if that is enough for you."
"Gamekult","80","Quotation forthcoming."
"Eurogamer","80","It is a majestic tribute to cinema, a movie game in the literal sense, and your enjoyment will be in precise step with your appreciation of that objective - and whether or not you believe it to be Drake's great deception, or Drake's great delight."
"GameCritics","75","Following the hyper-approachable formula used by Apple in the electronics industry, Naughty Dog has crafted another Uncharted game that a majority of players will feel is a welcoming and praiseworthy achievement. However, in comparison to many of its contemporaries, the gameplay ultimately feels stale and doesn't emphasize the more unique and rewarding qualities that separate video games from other media."
"GameShark","75","Uncharted 3 isn't a bad game, there's plenty of visual style and action to be seen, the characters are likeable, and there are a few puzzles that will make you think. The problem is that Uncharted 3 sometimes doesn't feel like a game at all, but a movie I'm watching play out without my participation."
"GameWatcher","75","Although the action in the final scenes is some of the best the title has to offer, the delivery of the narrative's closing stages is rushed and ultimately seems rather weak."
"The A.V. Club","50","Two years after Thieves, Uncharted's gameplay mechanics and conventions are no longer dated; they're borderline archaic."
