"Gamer.no","100","This epic role-playing game might be Bethesda's best game yet, and offers an unique and spectacular world filled with fun. The freedom ensures a great experience for both the casual and hardcore gamer, as you're free to play the game how you like."
"Thunderbolt","100","A magnificent hive of creativity and technical clout, and holds a world so open it frequently threatens to overwhelm. Skyrim is forever charming and consistently engaging, and will carve a completely different adventure for every player put under its dazzling spell."
"Total Video Games","100","A masterpiece of free-form gaming; one of the most ambitious games of this generation."
"Gaming Age","100","If you're looking for just one RPG to pass the time with this year (and probably next), Skyrim is definitely it."
"D+PAD Magazine","100","The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is so immense and chock-full of content that we could conceivably rant about it for pages, but to do so would only detract from the time you should spend physically playing it."
"DarkStation","100","Skyrim is the game that I would highly recommend to damn near anyone.  It's not too hard to figure out and it's got such an enormous amount of stuff to do that anyone would be able to see what is so special about the game."
"ZTGD","100","Simply put, this is a beautiful game. The scenery on display here is almost unparalleled in the genre. From scenic viewpoints atop snowy mountains to the rushing streams and waterfalls I found myself often just stopping and admiring for a while."
"Gamestyle","100","Skyrim, an absolute masterpiece, the more you invest in the game, the more you get out of it. A truly epic game that deserves all of the plaudits. It is more than a just game, it is an experience."
"GameShark","100","The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is a remarkable achievement that despite from a few niggling bugs is an undertaking unlike any other. This could quite easily be the only game you purchase for the next several months and still provide you with a complete sense of satisfaction. There are few titles that offer such an incredible level of value without resorting to multiplayer and for that I applaud Bethesda. Skyrim is a role-playing masterpiece."
"The A.V. Club","100","Skyrim lets these rough edges show, because the element of chaos lets players feel like the game is happening to them, and they are alive in it-not just cogs in a pre-fab Game Experience. That's what sets Skyrim apart from some of its contemporaries. Where many games with lavish production values seek to direct players' imaginations, Skyrim seeks to ignite them."
"Eurogamer Spain","100","The greatest thing about Skyrim is that Bethesda has created a world whereour imagination does not have to fill in the blanks: you just have toexplore them and live them."
"BigPond GameArena","100","Skyrim is completely and utterly addictive in every aspect and quite possibly, I'll say it, the greatest RPG of all time. It affords you the luxury of playing it your way and doesn't try to constrain you. It wants you to get lost in a winter wonderland and believe me, you will. Kiss the rest of your life goodbye."
"Meristation","100","After a trajectory of excellency with Oblivion and Fallout 3, Bethesda reaches a new level this generation, showing they have reached maturity in their unique way of making worlds. Thanks to their generosity, will and ambition, single players fans looking for huge worlds of high adventure can still keep dreaming. Skyrim is an absolute triumph."
"Digital Spy","100","If a deep combat system, an engaging plot, a wonderful cast of characters and a stunning, open-ended game world sounds like something you might be interested in, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim should be at the top of your list."
"Wired","100","The game's greatest accomplishment is that it is a paradise of escapism, a lavish love letter to immersion. Diving into Skyrim's world feels both thrilling and comforting, like riding a rollercoaster or swimming in the ocean. There is very little padding. There are very few scripted quests that aren't worth experiencing."
"The Escapist","100","An absolutely first-rate roleplaying game that combines an abundance of content with an abundance of quality. The outdated design elements are unfortunate but not so distracting that it ruins the depth of the story, the openness of the setting, or the visceral joys of combat."
"Game Revolution","100","A testament to the strength and importance of games that create living, breathing worlds, while affirming the value of long-term commitment over instant gratification. The absence of companion control, though a glaring flaw, ultimately does not spoil its purposeful, refined, and genre-defining design. Endlessly replayable and a phenomenal landmark in gaming, Skyrim deserves a place in every true gamer's collection."
"GamePro","100","Like every other game in the series, Skyrim is going to eat hundreds of hours of my gaming time over the next few years. It has that sense of wonder that makes he Elder Scrolls games so great, and with the changes to skills, the Shouts, and dual-wielding, I think any gamer is going to have a lot of fun with Skyrim (and its eventual expansions) as well."
"GamesRadar+","100","Skyrim is sprawling, generous, gorgeous and ambitious. It does what few games can: thoroughly follow through on its ambitions. It could be possible to play only this game for the next year and still not discover all of its mysteries."
"AusGamers","100","If you can only buy one game this holiday season and want your absolute money's worth, there's no looking past what is arguable the industry benchmark for sandbox and emergent gameplay with player-choice at its helm, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. A work of sheer genius."
"Gameblog.fr","100","Take what you loved in Morrowind, cut out what you hated in Oblivion, multiply by 10, mix well, and there you go: you get Elder Scrolls V Skyrim. With its deep background, enticing prophecy, new gameplay mechanisms, Skyrim mesmerizes us into diving in its world completely and forgetting about the usual shortcomings of the series (except the poor animations - they really are too bad to be overlooked). If you like the series, but don't love it, get this game. If you love the series, you better get yourself a pair of fresh undies, and fast."
"Guardian","100","Skyrim is one of the most gargantuan undertakings gamers will experience all year. The sheer size of the adventure, both in terms of its environment and in the amount of activities available to the player, is mind-blowing."
"Gamereactor Denmark","100","It is not often I get lost in a game like I did with Skyrim. Everything about this game screams quality and adventure. While Bethesda hasn't exactly got a track record for delivering bug-free games at launch, this has been a pleasant, polished and amazing experience so far. A much improved third-person view, amazing music, a living breathing world, a menu-system that's amazing and a game filled with interesting stuff to do. Truly a masterpiece."
"Gamereactor Sweden","100","Skyrim is bigger, better, deeper than it's already excellent predecessor and a true masterpiece. This is not only a contender to be the game of the year, but maybe even the best role-playing game ever."
"Official Xbox Magazine","100","Skyrim is the kind of game you can completely lose yourself in for at least a hundred hours, even if you somehow manage to complete the main quest in fewer than twenty. If you aren't normally drawn to role-playing games, get over it - to miss out on this extraordinary gaming experience would be positively criminal."
"Digital Chumps","100","The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is breathtaking, engrossing and deep. With gameplay and visual improvements, Bethesda set a new standard in The Elder Scrolls series with Skyrim, and with the action/RPG genre. This most certainly should be the game of the year."
"AtomicGamer","100","The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim may not deliver on every hope, wish or fervent demand you've been formulating ever since you realized how many flaws Oblivion was carefully hiding with its immense charm, but it most certainly lives up to the name Elder Scrolls and will easily qualify for millions of gamers' best-of-the-year lists."
"Official Xbox Magazine UK","100","Skyrim may frustrate you at times, but it will work its way inside your skin and replace the marrow of your bones. It never gives you an opportunity to neatly stop playing. Even if you manage to tear yourself away, the locations and the people will rattle around in your head. It'll give you stories to tell your friends, (although you should remember that many people simply won't be interested), and it'll give you an entire region to bend, beautifully slowly, to your will."
"Giant Bomb","100","No other game I know of operates with this many moving parts to create such an immense world filled with this much choice in how you engage its excellent, endless fiction. It's one thing when a game offers dozens of hours of gameplay; it's quite another when that gameplay is good enough you'll want to live in its world for that long."
"Joystiq","100","This is the deepest, lovliest world ever created for a single player to explore, and one that no one should deny themselves. This is a game about following Emerson's advice, leaving the trail and finding that the most powerful force on Earth or Tamriel isn't fire or sword, but the ever-insistent desire to know what lies beyond."
"Eurogamer","100","In weaving together the extraordinary craftsmanship evident in the music, storytelling, adventure and world design of Skyrim, Bethesda has created a very special game indeed - one that's likely to remain in the affections of gamers for many years to come."
"Destructoid","100","The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is every single reason to love a Western role-playing game, condensed into a single comprehensive experience with nothing lost in the conversion process."
"Xbox World Australia","99","While a few bugs are evident, Skyrim is the most solid effort Bethesda has launched and it's an even more impressive feat given the scale and scope of the world on offer. A captivating land, filled with captivating people, does more than enough to keep us as gamers and fantasy-enthusiasts to keep us coming back for more."
"Xbox Achievements","99","Simply put, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim has raised the bar in the RPG genre, offering a plethora of engaging and unique content in one of the most immersive and beautiful game worlds ever created. Plus, any game that uses the word ""lollygagging"" deserves eternal praise."
"Impulsegamer","99","If you are sitting on the fence about whether or not to get Skyrim, get it. It is worth it a million times over. The amount of time you could spend in this game is practically endless. The only potentially bad thing is that you could lose sleep because you won't want to stop playing."
"Game Chronicles","99","Bethesda has refined the RPG genre, crafting what is quite possibly the best RPG ever made."
"Games Master UK","98","Staggering detail collides with unprecedented scale. The game doesn't stop giving. Essential. [Jan 2012, p.57]"
"Vandal","98","A colossal and unique roleplaying game, incredibly generous in content, full of amazing details that we think only Bethesda can surpass in the future. One of the best games in history."
"Gamers' Temple","98","So back to the big question at hand: is Skyrim too much like Oblivion to the point where it loses credibility? In a word, no. If Skyrim had the exact same game engine and mechanics of Oblivion it would most likely be a contender for game of the year. But by addressing every issue from the last game and improving everything else, Skyrim leaves little room for error for the next game in the series."
"TeamXbox","98","This is easily one of the best RPGs to come out in this generation of consoles. You must own this game."
"GameFocus","97","Skyrim is the largest, and most compelling work that I've had the opportunity to play this year. It's engaging, engrossing, and will take over your gaming life for many months to come. Not only is Skyrim among the best that 2011 has to offer, but for me, this is, without hesitation, the Game of the Year."
"Multiplayer.it","97","This is the best Bethesda could afford with The Elder Scrolls series and if you're a real RPG player, you simply can't miss Skyrim."
"XGN","97","The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim does not only equal its legendary predecessor Oblivion; it surpasses it. The immense and atmospheric world and insane amount of content will have gamers captivated for months, while the more dynamic level structure and improved fighting possibilities won't allow for a single boring moment. Plus, Skyrim has dragons. Epic!"
"MondoXbox","97","The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is, undobtedly, Bethesda's masterwork: a deep, pure and vast RPG capable of satisfying both fans and newcomers to the genre thanks to great gameplay and an involving story. A strong contender to the title of best game of the year and of the entire generation."
"Planet Xbox 360","97","Whether you're wondering around the wilderness, enjoying the melodies from a bard in an inn, casually strutting about town, or going head to head with a dragon; the music and sound effects add to the immersion in the same way they do in a Lord of the Rings or Star Wars film."
"XboxAddict","97","Every aspect of Skyrim is done to pinpoint perfection and has the makings of a game that will be played and enjoyed by millions for years to come."
"Extreme Gamer","96","The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is a role-playing fans paradise."
"ActionTrip","96","The defining element of Skyrim is the choices that are given to players in every conceivable way. Weapon upgrades, character development, storyline progress, solving quests, exploration, NPC interaction, are all impressively crafted elements that almost feel like separate games molded into one unforgettable adventure."
"3DJuegos","96","Skyrim is one of the most captivating role-playing games of this generation. Each setting looks amazingly special and the artistic side of the game is just brilliant. This game is deeper and bigger than anything we have seen this year."
"SpazioGames","96","One of the best action RPGs to date. Crazy depth, lots of quest and dragons: Skyrim is everything the RPG fans are looking for."
"GameOver.gr","95","Improved from Oblivion in almost every way, Skyrim delivers an adventure beyond everything we've seen till now in the genre."
"PALGN","95","Just about the finest example of core, yet accessible, Western RPG and open-ended gameplay. In The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, Bethesda have realised the game they wanted to make since the inception of HD gaming."
"Gamer.nl","95","Skyrim is Bethesda's magnum opus. The game combines the best elements from Morrowind, Oblivion and Fallout 3 and makes it an outstanding adventure. The quality and quantity on offer here is incredible."
"Console Monster","95","Even with these issues there is only one way to describe Skyrim and that is epic. There is so much to see, do and experience that it's exceedingly easy to get lost in the fantasy. It's not a remarkable or radical departure from Oblivion, so if that game left you cold, Skyrim will too. For those who embraced that lifestyle, you will find Skyrim is Oblivion+++."
"Gameplanet","95","Where Oblivion may have caused many to sit on the fence when faced with any new Elder Scrolls release, Skyrim stands tall in redemption. It is, without any shadow of doubt, the best RPG experience available right now."
"Totally360","95","This is a title that deserves a spot in your gaming library.  The environments are stunning, the level of control you have over your own experience is amazing and, simply put, Skyrim is an epic experience."
"Machinima","95","Sometimes I feel like role-playing games have forgotten about the whole ""roleplaying"" part of the genre. So it's refreshing to play a game like Skyrim that imbues so much effort into immersing you in its world. Quit your job. Divorce your spouse. Give your children up for adoption. Do whatever you need to do to find the time to play Skyrim."
"NZGamer","95","Glitches aside, Skyrim is a big, beautiful game, that will overwhelm with its physical and emotional depths. And after thirty-five hours of playing I feel like I've only experienced a hint of what the Skyrim world has to offer. I love the way it manages to combine sandbox-style gameplay without sacrificing story progression or big political moments that lend credence to the experience of a real culture."
"IGN","95","Featuring the same kind of thrilling freedom of choice The Elder Scrolls series is known for along with beautiful visuals and a stirring soundtrack, playing Skyrim is a rare kind of intensely personal, deeply rewarding experience, and one of the best role-playing games yet produced."
"GameWatcher","95","But, assuming you're fine with that, then Skyrim is, in a word, amazing. Sure, it has its problems, it's oddities, and again some of these are just down to how the game is made and others just need some extra patching or work done to it. There is always a danger with games like these that you'll get bored, or you'll lose your drive - Bethesda have done a wonderful job of staving off that feeling in this game."
"Game Informer","95","It's one of the biggest, most content rich games I've ever had the pleasure of playing."
"Computer and Video Games","95","If you're an Elder Scrolls veteran, you'll already know what you're in for. This is not the next evolutionary stage of the series: rather a loving refinement of what made Oblivion and the now-aged PC title Morrowind so special. It's those games with better voice acting, a slicker interface, a richer world and an improved story. It's also the most polished and user friendly games in the series, with smarter character progression and a gentler learning curve."
"GamingTrend","94","Skyrim delivers a mind blowing level of content wrapped in a package that would be worth the experience at twice the price."
"GamingXP","94","The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim might not be perfect, but it is by far the best RPG experience of the year. The huge and wonderful province of Skyrim serves as a great setting for an even greater story evolving around a mystical hero."
"Game Over Online","93","The folks at Bethesda have built themselves quite a world, and while not perfect it is a joy to inhabit for a couple of hundred hours."
"Ten Ton Hammer","93","For those who crave ultimate RPG immersion to sink into for weeks of world exploration and questing Skyrim is a must-have."
"GameTrailers","93","The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim is extremely ambitious, and at its core, extremely successful. While overreaches in certain areas, it has much to offer in terms of freedom and volume of content. When you look back on the experience, it's not the rough spots that'll stand out, but the broad, heroic feeling of being the powerful and change-affecting center of a richly constructed world."
"Pelit (Finland)","92","The best Elder Scrolls game released so far. The atmosphere is just amazing and the fights against the dragons cause goosebumps every single time. There are still some stupid leftovers from Oblivion, but most of the errors from the previous game have been fixed. [Nov 2011]"
"Gaming Nexus","91","There is a substantial amount of content in Skyrim and while it's easy to nitpick on all the flaws present, Bethesda has still delivered a product that even a jaded gamer like myself can still be awestruck by."
"1UP","91","I've dabbled in Elder Scrolls games before, but they always seemed to be the wrong combination of intimidatingly huge and mechanically clunky (not to mention kind of ugly). Skyrim is the chapter that's finally pulled me in, and suddenly I find myself smitten with the series. Not just the games, but the lore, and the insane level of thought that's been invested in the world of Tamriel."
"Cynamite","90","Quotation forthcoming."
"X-ONE Magazine UK","90","Easily in line for a game of the year nod and one of the finest adventures this generation has seen. [Issue#79, p.64]"
"games(TM)","90","A picture-perfect playground designed to engender pure love in those willing to lose themselves within it. [Christmas 2011, p.90]"
"Eurogamer Portugal","90","Skyrim is epic in every sense, there is no other word for it. It is one of the biggest and best RPG ever made."
"Armchair Empire","90","Skyrim's pretty damn awesome."
"Metro GameCentral","90","Easily Bethesda's best game yet, with an impossibly detailed and beautiful game world and a new gold standard for Western style role-playing."
"Videogameszone.de","90","Skyrim is huge, beautiful and absorbing, filled with secrets, quests and adventure. Even though the story has its flaws and quests offer little freedom of choice, Skyrim still stands out as one of the best open world RPGs to date."
"Everyeye.it","90","With 300 hours of gameplay, some mechanics refinement and a complete new world, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is the perfect ""sequel"" to Oblivion. An epic game that RPG fans should not miss."
"Eurogamer Italy","90","Surely the greatest console RPG of the year and maybe one of the best chapters in the Elder Scrolls series. Skyrim is definitely one of the best gaming experiences of this generation."
"Worth Playing","90","In The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, the snow-capped peaks of the Nords relentlessly beckon me back to pry loose one more artifact, dungeon or secret. Skyrim's lavish world is tailor-made for adventurers who are eager to satisfy their curiosity of what is beyond the next bend in the road, not those who want to know which attribute scores play into which skill. There's little question that this is a gorgeous epic, but it's also a stark reminder of what it leaves behind."
"IncGamers","90","The bottom line is that, most of the time, Skyrim is a genuinely amazing game."
"RPGamer","90","Skyrim is one of the finest embodiments of an open world RPG, as there is never a dearth of places to go or quests to complete. What Skyrim lacks in tough role-playing choices, it more than compensates for with interesting things to do."
"GameSpot","90","Whether you're slashing a dragon's wings, raising the dead back to life, or experimenting at the alchemy table, Skyrim performs the most spectacular of enchantments: the one that causes huge chunks of time to vanish before you know it."
"Edge Magazine","90","These moments are why you play Skyrim, because in the instance of breathless excitement, triumph or discovery, you invest completely in its world."
"Cheat Code Central","90","In the end, Skyrim will be hailed as both the best and worst title of the year depending on whom you ask. RPG gamers who look for subtle storytelling and endless replay value are going to love every minute. But gamers that have even a slight problem with impatience will quickly become frustrated. However, even the most devoted naysayer has to admit that Skyrim is at the top of its genre, and that's no small feat."
"VideoGamer","90","Skyrim is easily one of the strongest and best examples of the Western RPG, and it further establishes Bethesda's reputation as one of the most talented and creative forces in the gaming industry. Moreover, it offers players a world so vast they could easily become lost in it, and so beautiful they may never wish to return from it."
"RPG Fan","88","The latest Elder Scrolls has such confidence in the allure of its open-world structure that it shirks the need to compete. And, it largely succeeds in being better than the sum of its parts."
"Gamekult","80","Quests are better structured, the dramatic moments abound, and the atmosphere of the northern title is incredibly immersive. There are also, inevitably, small bugs, pathfinding problems, inconsistencies, repeated load times and other annoying issues which punctuate the experience bit by bit."
"Da Gameboyz","75","Oblivion is good, but it's a flawed good. It's a different experience in many ways to previous Elder Scrolls games, but, at the same time, it's still the familiar world Elder Scrolls fans know and love. It has the usual kickass story, but the difficulty curve is a bit wobbly, to say the least, and, in general, it's a story of give and take."
