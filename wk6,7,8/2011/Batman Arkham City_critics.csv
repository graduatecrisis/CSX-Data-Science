"X-ONE Magazine UK","100","A Batman game like never before. Fans will feel like they're dreaming, whereas everyone else has an incredibly large and in-depth world to enjoy and engage with. It doesn't get much better. [Issue#78, p.80]"
"Gaming Nexus","100","Arkham City is not just one of the best games of the year, but also one of the greatest comic book games of all time!"
"GamerNode","100","Rocksteady Studios has done it again. It may not be perfect, but it has taken it's predecessor's place as the best superhero game of all time. One of the best that this year has to offer."
"GameShark","100","Arkham City, on the other hand, is a game about saving a city, Gotham City, and the experience is all the better for it."
"PALGN","100","Believe the hype. Arkham City is one of the most important games made for this generation and it's also a masterclass in design, execution and treatment."
"Eurogamer Italy","100","Arkham City easily beat its predecessor Arkham Asylum in every possible way. It's a must-have and a serious contender for the ""Game of the Year"" title."
"Gaming Age","100","Arkham City is huge, filled with secrets, and if you're a big Batman fan you'll love all the appearances tossed in, both for the good and bad guys. The addition of a New Game Plus mode also provides an astounding amount of replay value, and if you're any kind of completionist, you'll spend dozens of hours exploring the city for every little secret it contains. It's easily one of the best titles I've played all year."
"ZTGD","100","Batman: Arkham City is a rare treat, much like its predecessor. Not only is it a great licensed game, it is quite possibly the best superhero game ever made."
"Gamer.no","100","With one of the best open worlds in any game and an immaculate mix of great side missions, tons of content and a fantastic atmosphere, Batman: Arkham City stands among the greatest action experiences in recent times."
"Official Xbox Magazine","100","A week after beating the main campaign (at which point, we dove right back to side missions), its final image is lodged in our heads. And that's okay, because every time we think of Arkham City, we smile."
"GameWatcher","100","Arkham City is stuffed to the edge of the disc with content and replay value (in addition to the gigantic campaign there's an expanded Challenge Mode and New Game Plus), is incredible amounts of fun, is polished to perfection, has had real love poured into every aspect, and most importantly, it makes you feel like Batman."
"GamePro","100","There's a real sense of progression to Arkham City in its gameplay, in its story, in the variety of its missions (the abundance of open world side-quests will keep you busy for a long, long time), and in the evolution of its pointy-eared protagonist, that really deserves to be commended."
"Guardian","100","Stands head and shoulders over its previous efforts. Despite facing stiffer competition than its predecessor, Batman: Arkham City is easily the best Batman video game of all time."
"Digital Spy","100","The richness of the world is helped by the fact that Arkham City is a stunning looking game. This is one of the most detailed, rich and vibrant open worlds ever created, whether you are gliding over its skyline or striding down the broken-down streets. Considering the size of the world, the rich detail of the interiors is incredible, putting many more linear games to shame."
"BigPond GameArena","100","It's the best treatment of a comic book character outside of graphic novels ever. It's the best Action Adventure/Open World game ever. It's the best game I've played this year. And finally, it's the best superhero game you've ever played."
"Gameblog.fr","100","Rocksteady delivers a new masterpiece, enhancing the original in almost every way. Batman Arkham City offers a better story, masterfully paced storytelling, more freedom, more surprises, secondary missions and tasks, an intensified combat with new moves... To sum it up, a follow-up that met our expectations, without forgetting the strengths of the original, and growing up to be a spot-on tale of adventure and excitement: a serious candidate for the GOTY title."
"GamesRadar+","100","Batman: Arkham Asylum was the greatest superhero game of all time. The sequel, Batman: Arkham City, is five times bigger and about a billion times better. You do the math."
"Telegraph","100","A wonderful, startlingly complete package tailored for the single player. In these days of multiplayer crowbarred into any old game, it's a relief, a bold statement of intent that Rocksteady have created such a supremely focused but hugely expansive video game. It's a brave, committed, confident piece of work."
"Eurogamer Sweden","100","Rocksteady Studios surprised us all back in 2009 by delivering one of the best games that year with Batman: Arkham Asylum. This year they show us that they are a force to be reckoned with when Batman: Arkham City more than lives up to expectations; it surpasses them in what is a very strong contender for Game of the Year 2011. No multiplayer? Who gives a bats a**?"
"Giant Bomb","100","It might not rewrite the book on Batman video games, but when you're building off of such a strong position--and you're only shipping the second game with such similarities, rather than a third or fourth--it's hard to bicker too much about what changes the developers did or didn't make."
"1UP","100","Controlling Batman as he completely terrorizes his victims, whether via the invisible predator gameplay or the brutal combat, is an experience rivaled by few others. From its memorable Bourne Identity-esque opening to its shocking ending, Batman: Arkham City secures its place as my favorite superhero game since Freedom Force."
"VideoGamer","100","It doesn't take the world's greatest detective to spot that this is an expertly crafted adventure, one that maintains a breathtaking pace and invigorating rhythm from beginning to end. Dizzyingly extensive and lovingly detailed, Rocksteady has created an intricate, spirited and unequalled playground worthy of one of the most iconic characters in modern fiction."
"Game Informer","100","This game could be one of the biggest and most enjoyable time sinks of the year. Arkham City not only lives up to the standards set by Arkham Asylum, it bests its predecessor in every way and stands tall as one of Batman's greatest moments. [Nov 2011]"
"GameFocus","99","Every aspect of the game has been improved in ways that made it difficult to put the controller down."
"Extreme Gamer","98","Unparalleled in its representation of the Bat, Batman: Arkham City is a pedigree of gaming making and content adaption that no Batman fan should be without."
"NZGamer","97","Even Catwoman's playable missions, which I initially considered to be a cheap selling gimmick, add a lot of value to this game. Her titillating character plays in a completely different manner to the Caped Crusader's and the change in tempo works well."
"AusGamers","97","A perfect sequel, and a near-perfect action game. It's stunning to look at (seriously, just watch the snow flakes hit his suit for a minute), plays as smooth as they come, offers an unprecedented sense of player-choice in an open-world, despite being caged in a makeshift prison, and harbors among the best voice-acting and scripting the Batman universe, and games, have ever seen. It's dark, brooding and relentless in adult themes, yet requires no gore to relay any of this."
"Games Master UK","97","Brave, brutal, brilliant - the gold standard by which all future videogames should be judged. [Dec 2011, p.67]"
"Xbox Achievements","96","An outstanding sequel in every department, with stunning gameplay, an immersive world to explore and fantastically well-realised characterisation. The music and voice-acting is exemplary and the visuals are gorgeous. Batman: Arkham City is an incredibly well-crafted, labour of love and no mistake. In short, it's genius."
"Console Monster","96","As someone who doesn't really enjoy Superhero games, Arkham City and I hit it off from the word go, as I was pulled into the story and role of a crime fighting genius."
"Xbox World 360 Magazine UK","96","Predictably and brilliantly mind-blowing. In every way that matters, this really is ""The Dark Knight"" to Arkham Asylum's ""Batman Begins.""  [Christmas 2011, p.92]"
"Xbox World Australia","96","Sequels this good rarely come along. To best a game as technically and thematically sound as Arkham Asylum takes some doing and Rocksteady have delivered in spades. It matches its predecessor's narrative finesse, and excels in every other aspect. What it lacks it 'whoa' value, it makes up for with a host of side quests, collectibles and nods to Gotham's history that is sure to keep any Batman enthusiast occupied."
"XGN","96","Batman is coloer than ever in this all new adventure. You'll fly from one magnificent moment to the other, with absolutely no time for boredom. Batman: Arkham City offers you the ultimate package, the best of the best and has everything you can ever ask for from a superhero game."
"Planet Xbox 360","95","Improved gameplay, new mechanics, and an even stronger story denote whether you care about Batman or not, it's still a game worthy of your time. With some easter eggs possibly hinting at plots for a third game, let's hope Rocksteady isn't quite done with the Dark Knight."
"Gamer Limit","95","All in all, outside of a few minor issues, I couldn't ask for a better Batman experience. If Arkham City was a graphic novel, it would be considered a classic."
"TeamXbox","95","The formula that Rocksteady started with Arkham Asylum has been all-but perfected in Arkham City. This game hits you hard, hits you where it hurts and leaves you begging for more."
"Game Over Online","95","Batman: Arkham City is an absolute must for anyone who loved Arkham Asylum. If you didn't play that, then do that first because the storylines tie into each other."
"XboxAddict","95","So now the stage has been set, the characters are all in place, the battle lines drawn, and Batman is up against his greatest challenge yet."
"GameOver.gr","95","Bigger, better and more versatile than its predecessor. Arkham City is a superb gaming achievement, and with it Rocksteady earns a rightful place in this generation's most talented developers."
"Totally360","95","Not only is this a really amazing Batman title, it is a really amazing action adventure title overall.  My only complaint is that some of the boss battles were a little annoying, however, the game overall is a masterpiece."
"GRYOnline.pl","95","Batman: Arkham City is an excellent production and undoubtedly one of the strong candidates for the ""game of tye year"" title. The sequel is a better game in all aspects. It doesn't allow you to step away from the screen due to great gameplay solutions, a really interesting story and rich content. I assure you that Arkham City isn't a game to be put on a shelf after one or two nights. If you're a fan of the pervious game, you don't need a recommendation. If you're new to the franchise - quickly get to know the entire series. I wish there were more games like this one."
"3DJuegos","95","Rocksteady already proved that they're an amazing studio with Arkham Asylum, but with Arkham City they now belong to the Olympus of the Action/Adventure genre. This game is the ultimate superhero experience."
"Gamer.nl","95","Arkham City is better than its predecessor in every way. The gameworld, the move set and the story have all grown. The numerous subplots and villains that take the stage make this game almost too much of a good thing."
"Gameplanet","95","Arkham City does what everyone hoped it would yet feared it couldn't; expand and improve on Arkham Asylum. Indeed, Arkham City is a bigger and better game in all regards, delivering an immaculately presented, rich, compelling play experience and gripping story while simultaneously respecting its source material's legacy and pushing the Batman myth further forward."
"Everyeye.it","95","Arkham City is a masterpiece. The improved free-flow combat system and various new gadgets contribute to brilliant gameplay, while a complex screenplay delivers a breathtaking experience. But it's the number and the characterization of villains and personalities that stand as an incredible surplus value."
"Machinima","95","Combat is extremely fulfilling due to the fact that you can string together attacks, counters, gadget quick attacks, and special moves completely flawlessly."
"IGN","95","Batman: Arkham City isn't just better than Batman: Arkham Asylum, it's better than most games on the market."
"Computer and Video Games","95","It's a belief in the character and, most importantly, a belief in itself that has seen the studio deliver one of the greatest Batman interpretations of all time. And you know what? Maybe even one of the best games ever."
"MondoXbox","94","A great game, that successfully builds upon the foundation of the first title delivering us one of the best super heroes and action games around. It lacks highly memorable moments like the ones in the original game and delivers a quite disappointing final boss fight, but its incredible content richness and great gameplay make it an highly suggested buy."
"SpazioGames","94","Rocksteady managed to clear up the few things that didn't work in Asylum and widen its scope. The result is another real Batman experience, offering an in-depth look on the charachter that even Nolan's movies (at least until now) cannot offer, and an unforgettable gaming experience."
"Game Chronicles","93","Batman: Arkham City is easily the most immersive superhero game I've played since those open-world Spider-Man games, and quite possibly a contender for Game of the Year."
"Multiplayer.it","93","Batman: Arkham City isn't just better than Arkham Asylum, it's one of the best game ever made and it's also one of the very few satisfying experiences that has been produced in the last few years."
"Vandal","93","It is not as surprising as Arkham Asylum, but it improves upon it, updating and enhancing all its elements, and also allowing us to feel like Batman patrolling the troubled streets of Gotham. Although with few new features in gameplay, it is the best Batman game ever made, and one of the best games of this year."
"GameTrailers","93","Arkham City feels like a logical extension of its predecessor, wholly embracing and expanding upon all the elements that made it great. It most certainly is the definitive Batman game, but to leave it there would be to damn it with faint praise. Simply put, if you admire painstakingly-realized worlds rich with secrets and game mechanics that never cease to surprise you, then you it to yourself to experience Arkham City. Your interest in the source material is irrelevant."
"Pelit (Finland)","92","Arkham City continues to amaze. If you thought Arkham Asylum was great, City is even better. Gliding around the open world is great fun and the combat system has surprising depth in it. The story suffers a bit from the sheer number of many supervillains in it, but otherwise Arkham City is one of the best games of 2011. [Oct 2011]"
"ActionTrip","92","Finishing Batman: Arkham City was an immensely rewarding experience. It's a shame the main story didn't last a bit longer. However, we weren't bothered by this, because the game doesn't shy away from offering a ton of content even when you're done with your first playthrough."
"Videogameszone.de","92","The new Batman is bigger, better and much more dangerous than Arkham Asylum. The atmosphere is brilliantly designed like Batman himself. There are wonderful side-quests and well designed puzzles as well. Players that did not play Batman: Arkham Asylum will feel left alone a bit because there is no real tutorial."
"The A.V. Club","91","Arkham City and The Dark Knight (film) have something much more important in common: They're so sublime, they render their predecessors nearly forgettable by comparison."
"GamingXP","91","Great sequel to a already great game. Lots of variety, all of the tools Batman has to offer, great graphics, and a stunning atmosphere transform this into a must-have title for Batman fans."
"games(TM)","90","Arkham City handles its side-stories gloriously. [Christmas 2011, p.102]"
"D+PAD Magazine","90","Batman: Arkham City isn't the surprise that the first game was and instead has to live up to the hype and remain fresh by bringing in new ideas whilst building on the old ones. This sequel handles the challenge admirable, making for what is so far the closest thing gamers have to a definitive Batman experience."
"CD-Action","90","Arkham City is a wonderful game that we expected it to be but regrettably despite all the enhancements it introduces it is not clearly better than Arkham Asylum. [November 2011, p.36]"
"Eurogamer Spain","90","Arkham City was one of the most anticipated games of the year and ends upbeing one of the best. This is an exemplary sequel, better than the firstgame in every respect."
"Cynamite","90","With a gripping fighting system, lots of diversity and a great atmosphere, Batman: Arkham City is one of the best superhero games out there. Some may even say it is one of the best games of all time."
"Level7.nu","90","The successor to the critically acclaimed Batman Arkham Asylum is bigger, looks better and contains even more content in form of more villains, more riddles and more side quests then its predecessor. Though it's near perfect in almost every way, the large amount of characters included from the Batman universe paradoxically becomes a flaw as there's too many of them to present them all in a logical and deserving way. Still, Batman Arkham City is a wonderful masterpiece that should not be missed."
"The Escapist","90","An action-heavy realization of what makes Batman such a compelling hero, complete with a fascinating world, a smart story and loads of rewards for exploring it all."
"DarkZero","90","Whether you loved the previous game, or have had no experience with Rocksteady's Batman series up until now, Arkham City belongs on your shelf, in your console, and in your life."
"Gamereactor Sweden","90","Batman is back, better than ever with new tools, new areas to explore and an exiting adventure. Arkham City is better that it's predecessor in every possible way and in the end one of the best games this generation."
"Da Gameboyz","90","Batman: Arkham City is about as good as it gets when it comes to action adventure video games. Engaging storyline, slick combat, superb visuals and deep single player campaign mode makes Batman: Arkham City a must own title this holiday season."
"Games.cz","90","The best Batman video game? Certainly. The best comics video game? Very likely. The best video game of the year 2011? Who knows… The sure thing is that Arkham City is a paradise for all of you in love with dark worlds thick with interesting characters, events and great gameplay. Bravo!"
"DarkStation","90","Batman: Arkham City is the best superhero game available, it is a perfect example of how a license should be used in a game. It's not quite as open world as I would have liked, but it is polished to near perfection."
"AtomicGamer","90","If you had nearly any kind of fun with Rocksteady's previous effort or you're just looking to jump into a good comic book game, then Arkham City should be at or near the top of your list."
"Gamereactor Denmark","90","Arkham City is a display of power. Its predecessor was one of the best licensed games ever, but it's as if Rocksteady has found another gear, just as we thought they were already running at top speed. It's an amazing game, and one of the greatest releases this year."
"Cheat Code Central","90","This ""broader scope"" is actually where Arkham City delivers tenfold upon expectations. While in Arkham Asylum, players got a really good sense of Batman ""trapped."" Now, Arkham City isn't so much about Batman being trapped in the city, but about the inmates being trapped inside Arkham City with Batman. And we couldn't be happier about it."
"Edge Magazine","90","So if Arkham Asylum was defined by its limits, Arkham City is a careful, considered exercise in stripping those limits away. Its open city lets players be a different kind of Batman to the stealthy predator of Asylum – this is the Batman of dropped smoke pellets and theatrical getaways, the Batman with an ear to the ground for the strong picking on the weak, and the Batman who floats above the city with a gothic majesty."
"Wired","90","Weighed down by bloat though it may be, Batman: Arkham City is still one of the year's finest games, filled with the capacity to surprise even players who've skulked through every inch of its predecessor."
"Metro GameCentral","90","Not just the best superhero game, but one of the greatest action adventures ever made - set in an expansive and engrossing virtual world unlike any other."
"GameSpot","90","From the speedy exhilaration of soaring high above the streets to the atmospheric thrill of discovering long-forgotten secrets in the tunnels below Gotham, this is an unforgettable adventure that will keep you coming back to the cape and cowl long after you've seen the credits roll."
"IncGamers","90","No matter what though, what can't be denied is the quality and entertainment-factor of the overall product. Whether you like Batman or not, you'll find much to like here. In the matter of only two games, Rocksteady has managed to create a Batman franchise that provides us with not only the best videogame incarnation of the Caped Crusader, but the best videogame incarnation of any superhero."
"Joystiq","90","Rocksteady has made the greatest Batman game ever crafted, and they've done that before. But breathing life into a staggeringly beautiful world; one which hums not only with opportunity, but ambition? That's a new trick altogether."
"Official Xbox Magazine UK","90","The game doesn't benefit from the novelty of Rocksteady's first, pitch-perfect effort, but based on the quality and beauty of Gotham's pair of correctional institutes, we're perfectly happy to be incarcerated again."
"Eurogamer","90","It's a role-playing game in the most literal sense of the phrase, a game in which you're encouraged to give in to the fantasy, and to see what life is like when it's composed of rooftop brawls and zip-line getaways. Animations, traversal mechanics, takedowns: they're all building towards the same thing. In Arkham City, you become Batman."
"GamingTrend","88","A fantastic romp with the Dark Knight through a suitably dark and depressing city, with your fists, your toys and a fantastic new take on the story. While it engages more sandbox gameplay, it ultimately is a true sequel to the Arkham Asylum in both feel and presentation and is a worthy purchase, even if it isn't that long or that large."
"Armchair Empire","85","Batman: Arkham City is still one of those games that will have a strong presence on list for Game of the Year and it deserves that kind of attention but it didn't quite grab me the same way Arkham Asylum did."
"Worth Playing","85","When all is said and done, Batman: Arkham City is an enjoyable game with plenty of content to explore. Just know that despite a fresh coat of paint, there's nothing really new here. If you enjoyed Arkham Asylum and simply want more of the same, you're going to love Arkham City. Those who were hoping for an evolution in play, however, are going to be left wanting."
"Destructoid","85","It doesn't quite reach the highs of its predecessor, but Arkham City rarely sinks low. When it's all said and done, you'll be begging for more, but not because there wasn't enough. It is just too damn fun to be The Bat."
"Gamekult","80","Even if there is still some reason to quibble here and there, Arkham City is undoubtedly the result of which we dreamed, rich and surprising in many ways. A feat which makes it a must-see title of 2011."
