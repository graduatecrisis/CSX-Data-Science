"X-ONE Magazine UK","100","A truly spectacular sequel that reaches previously unthinkable heights. Portal 2 is an experience to be cherished and already a strong contender for the best game of 2011. [Issue#72, p.78]"
"Gamers' Temple","100","Portal 2 is really a worthy successor to Portal, and is a great example of a very well-designed, well-implemented game. I recommend it highly."
"Gamestyle","100","There is no such thing as perfection, no matter how much we strive for it, therefore a couple of minor niggles do not distract from a top score. Portal 2 is the Game of the Year so far, it will take something special for it not to take that accolade. Sometimes the anticipation of a games release can leave the final thing feeling a little flat. That is not the case here as Portal 2 lives up to all expectations and then some."
"GamerNode","100","It's hard to overstate my satisfaction. Play Portal 2 as soon as you can."
"The A.V. Club","100","If there was ever any doubt that Portal could be expanded into a big, narrative experience with all the bells and whistles of a mainstream gaming hit, have no fear. Valve solved that puzzle with Portal 2."
"Game Revolution","100","Impatience aside, Portal 2 is an exceptionally well-crafted, intelligent, entertaining, humorous game. You will laugh. You will feel like a freaking genius. You will want more. And yes, you will probably be hearing quotes from Portal 2 for the next three years."
"GameSpy","100","Sporting some of the best writing and voice work in years (as well as some deviously designed puzzles), Portal 2's single-player campaign is superior to its predecessor in every way. It's the co-op mode, however, that makes this 2011's first must-play game -- even for those gamers that don't like first-person or puzzle games."
"GamesRadar+","100","Portal 2 couldn't be Portal, but it's the next best thing. It's a longer, funnier, more emotional plummet through Aperture's perplexing laboratory, and its meticulous detail, perfect pacing, and kinetic, mind-expanding puzzles make it a blazingly memorable experience. It's so damn memorable, already feel nostalgic about it."
"Total Video Games","100","Genius is an often overused word but Valve's work on Portal 2 is genius in the truest sense. The studio has exhibited exceptional creativity in the game, even compared to some of its other masterpieces. If we could give it 11/10, we would."
"Gaming Nexus","100","Portal 2 is a masterful execution of one of the key components of gaming, fun. Valve has really outdone themselves this time, and managed to make me say, ""What's episode 3?"""
"1UP","100","While it's unclear if we'll ever see GLaDOS or Chell again, this much is certain: Portal 2 is one of the best games of this generation."
"GameWatcher","100","Never before has a review embargo had us screaming inside so badly that our mind eventually goes hoarse. We've wanted to shout from the rooftops about how Portal 2 not only betters the original Portal, but completely annihilates it...If you thought the original Portal was a masterpiece, prepare to have your mind blown."
"GamePro","100","Bigger, tougher, and funnier, Portal 2 manages to expand on its perfectly succinct predecessor in just about every way. Boasting two excellent campaigns, each rife with satisfying puzzles and even more satisfying ""Eureka!"" moments, Valve's latest is an absolute must-own, plain and simple."
"VideoGamer","100","A mere ten minutes here will yield more memorable moments than you're likely to squeeze out of the entirety of most other games this year. In all aspects of its design, Portal 2 is genius."
"Telegraph","100","It's a work of masterful craft, mechanically constructed with military precision, artistically wrapped in a tremendous story and environment. Most impressively, its achievements feel effortless."
"Eurogamer Italy","100","Portal 2 is a masterpiece. Valve did everything possible to evolve the original concept, creating an almost perfect experience only disturbed by a couple of minor issues. With both an intense single-player mode and a perfect co-op multiplayer Portal 2 is a true must-buy."
"Giant Bomb","100","Despite being so much bigger than the original, I actually felt a little melancholy once Portal 2 was over, simply because it's so rare to find a game this smart, this funny, and this rich with detail. It elevates Portal from an odd, memorable experiment to one of the most significant series in Valve's stable with a unique voice and an incredible level of quality that all developers should aspire to."
"Guardian","100","Valve has created a masterpiece in Portal 2. The depth of content, the mind-bending mechanics and fantastic experience are almost certain to satisfy ardent fans of the first game; and to all newcomers to the series, it's as simple as this: prepare to have your mind blown. Over and over again."
"Official Xbox Magazine UK","100","While it's worth replaying to catch the dialogue you missed the first time round - a spectacular rarity in any game - and to hunt out the hidden Rat Man rooms, there isn't enough variety in the way you solve puzzles to sustain repeat runthroughs. We're going to need DLC, and plenty of it, to keep our co-op partnership going."
"AusGamers","98","Portal 2 is a triumph in every sense of the word, a wonderful experience from start to finish and one that you won't soon forget."
"GamingTrend","97","Portal 2 is hands-down the best game thus far released in 2011."
"XGN","97","Portal 2 is better in every possible way when compared to its predecessor. The writing is brilliant and the voice actors have managed once again to bring the robots to life perfectly. Valve proves to be an amazing developer and brings us what could be the best game this generation has ever known."
"Play.tm","97","A joy to play. There is no other way to describe it."
"GameFocus","97","Without a doubt, Portal 2, if not the best game of 2011, will be amongst the top of the heap when the year closes out. The fantastic story, excellent pacing, interesting and engaging puzzles and other incredible facets to the game make it one that people should experience at any cost."
"Vandal","96","It starts slowly and at first might seem like an expansion, but it has many epic moments waiting for you. It is not the perfect game, but comes dangerously close."
"Digital Chumps","96","With Portal 2, Valve willfully defied common logic by creating an exceptionally detailed yet mainstream friendly experience out of, essentially, a puzzle game."
"IncGamers","96","By concentrating on iteration rather than re-design, Valve have created a sequel that improves upon the original and yet stays true to its memory. The puzzles, the story and the expert way in which players are taught to use the new tools all combine to create what is very possibly the most absorbing game the puzzle genre has ever seen."
"Xbox World Australia","95","Valve took a great concept, and turned it into an interesting, intellectual marvel that stopped the gaming world. They then took that marvel and made it better again. Portal 2 is an achievement in writing, and I'll be stunned should it be robbed of appropriate accolades. Not many games this year will be as funny, charming and intellectually puzzling as Portal 2, and that's no surprise – because it's so damn good."
"XboxAddict","95","You're not going to find better writing, dialogue, and perfect voice acting anywhere else. The script is so brilliant and was the single reason I kept playing. The wit and humor is so amazing that you'll be laughing out loud at some of the one liners thrown your way. I'm elated that it wasn't just a longer drawn out Portal experience and has its own merits to be a game all of its own."
"GamingExcellence","95","Fantastic writing, excellent gameplay, and a level of polish and playtesting so high that you know it's got to be a Valve title, Portal 2 is simply a game that can not be missed."
"MS Xbox World","95","The gameplay, while brilliant and innovative, can drag a bit at times, but the writing carries the game through those times, and the mostly great graphics and perfect audio seal the deal. There's a lot more content than most may be expecting, too. On the whole, it's an amazing game from a company known for making amazing games. It's a truly worthwhile sequel that lives up to its predecessor, and that alone is rare enough that the game is worth checking out."
"Meristation","95","Portal 2 is the great game that fans hoped. GLaDOS is back to make our life difficult. It doesn't allow us out of this hell that is the Aperture laboratory. Vegetation, more puzzles and many new challenges for one or two players."
"Official Xbox Magazine","95","Portal 2 isn't dessert - it's a delectable multi-course meal at a five-star restaurant. Make your reservation now."
"Totally360","95","Overall, Portal 2 is an absolutely amazing title. Everyone (including myself) was disappointed when Portal 2 was delayed earlier this year, however, it was more than worth the wait. Portal 2 is a masterpiece that I can see myself playing for years."
"Game Informer","95","The game's quality stays consistently outstanding throughout; there isn't a minute of filler content to be found anywhere in single-player or co-op."
"IGN","95","Makes the original look like the prototype it was. It's filled with a larger cast of characters vividly brought to life through brilliant writing and some of the best voice acting in video games...From the beginning of the single-player story to the end of the co-op mode, Portal 2 is a novel, unforgettable experience."
"Game Chronicles","94","Portal 2 may be the best game of 2011. It may be the best game of all-time. It is certainly the best game you can play right now. I loved every moment I spent with Portal 2. I'm even enjoying looking at the game sitting on my shelf knowing how much fun I will have again someday when I revisit Aperture Science, alone or hopefully with a friend who may not have played the game. Portal 2 proves that you don't have to kill things to make a great game and more importantly…science is fun!"
"Da Gameboyz","94","Portal 2 is a top notch experience throughout. Whether you're a fan of the first game, looking for a grade A title, or simply looking for an experience other than the myriad of shooters out there today which, with Portal 2, you can't go wrong here. If the story doesn't keep you coming back the cooperative multiplayer or puzzle based gameplay will. Portal 2 is another great title from Valve and definitely worth the price of admission."
"TeamXbox","94","It is engaging, clever, genuinely funny, and all-around unique. The puzzles are always a challenge, but none of them go into the realm of the impossible – clever thinking and analysis is always enough to solve them, and gives a sense of accomplishment when you get it right."
"Videogameszone.de","94","Wonderful humour, a thrilling story, innovative new gameplay elements and hours of mind-boggling puzzles - Portal 2 is a masterpiece. If you liked the prequel, you will love this one."
"Cheat Code Central","94","Portal 2 includes groundbreaking gameplay, a collection of deep and nuanced characters, a completely insane story, and some incredible gaming moments you'll probably never forget."
"Game Over Online","94","Portal 2 has an enormous warmth that makes it easy to adore, even when you're up against its many frustrating brainteasers. An amazing gameplay experience merged with a very unique, engrossing concept. Truly an exceptional experience that almost any gamer should give at least one go."
"SpazioGames","94","The qualities of Portal 2 are rarely seen in a videogame. Compelling, lasting and smart: each and every minute of gameplay is filled with incredible content. If you love gaming, you can't miss this masterpiece."
"Xbox Achievements","93","Valve has worked its magic yet again with Portal 2, creating a mind-blowing game that's simply superb in both single-player and co-op. In other words, it's hole-ly essential."
"Computer and Video Games","93","Imaginative, challenging, hilarious and sometimes a bit exhausting, Portal 2 is one of 2011's most interesting, challenging blockbusters. Just make sure you take your sweet, sweet time with it - because you'll probably feel a hole in your head once it's done and dusted."
"Xbox World 360 Magazine UK","92","A huge and stunning sequel, as witty as it is brain-bendingly challenging. [July 2011, p.98]"
"Planet Xbox 360","92","Really, don't miss Portal 2. Even if you've never played the first game, the sheer brilliance that has gone into this game's design shouldn't be missed. It's wonderfully fun and creative, while looking and sounding like a true sequel should. Don't be surprised if this one pops up on our best of 2011 list."
"Multiplayer.it","91","Portal 2 shows how a sequel has to be: longer, more varied and with a big plot. However there are several minor flaws: from the technical aspects to some lows of the single player campaign."
"Thunderbolt","90","Indeed, this is both mathematical and storytelling art-work; it teams a gripping narrative with an inventive gameplay mechanic that makes for an excellent and unforgettable ride."
"Gamer.nl","90","Portal 2 is an amazing puzzle game that, thanks to ingenious puzzles and an especially homourous story, keeps you gleud to your screen for hours on end. And you'll play it all with a big smile on your face."
"Wired","90","Portal 2 is in the business of defying players' expectations. Valve never wants you to predict what's going to happen at any moment, and delights in subtly setting those pins up and knocking them down. Even more than the clever gameplay mechanics and sharply written story, the smiles and laughter that such a carefully crafted game can extract from you mean this one will stay with you for years to come."
"Eurogamer Sweden","90","The original Portal was a delicious dessert in the five-course meal that was The Orange Box. Portal 2 is a much more meaty affair altogether and incorporates humor, great puzzling and a wonderful co-op mode while still being true to the original."
"Joystiq","90","Between real, actual co-op and Chell's adventure, Portal 2 provides a stupendous package. So stupendous, in fact, that I feel tremendously guilty admitting that somewhere, way deep down in whatever critics have in place of a heart, I kind of wish it didn't exist."
"Worth Playing","90","Portal 2 is more of the same, but only in the best of ways. Valve didn't mess with a winning formula, and the end result is that Portal 2 is a better game than its excellent predecessor."
"GameZone","90","Ultimately, Portal 2 is pure genius. With gameplay that never stops becoming addictive and new characters that always threaten to steal the spotlight, Portal 2 is one of the best games of 2011."
"games(TM)","90","From gloriously glib opening to predictably musical finale, Portal 2 is a genuine delight and a game of rare quality. A well-judged sense of humour meets with some truly ingenious puzzle design to create a gaming experience that will linger long in the memory."
"GameTrailers","90","Just like its predecessor, this sequel manages to wring every last ounce of enjoyment out of seemingly simple core concepts. If you're strictly into action its slow, plodding, calculated pace will be a turnoff. Yet, somehow Valve has managed to make a puzzle game that will make your pulse rise with a never ending daisy chain of positive reinforcement."
"MondoXbox","90","Portal 2 builds upon the great gameplay of the first game, adding a compelling and humorous story and a great co-op campaign. If you played the first Portal, this game won't feel as fresh and innovative to you and the developers lowered the difficulty bar too; nonetheless, this is a very recommended game that every lover of logic puzzles should buy."
"GameOver.gr","90","It could be argued that Portal didn't need a sequel, such a unique and complete experience as it was, but since it got one, it might as well be this; a game that stays true to the spirit of the original, while at the same time expanding and adding onto it, without over-complicating the experience. If this is how Valve chose to spend their time instead of developing Episode 3, we're not going to be the ones to complain!"
"GameSpot","90","Your return to Aperture Science is a joyful one in this immensely appealing, laugh-out-loud funny, and thoroughly satisfying sequel."
"Gamers.at","89","By no means as revolutionary as the first game, but still lots and lots of fun. For some the overall playthrough time might be too short though, but Aperture is a place to visit again and again."
"Extreme Gamer","87","Even with its high praise, Portal 2 isn't perfect, but it's imaginative, it's sophisticated, and one of the best puzzlers we've played in years."
"Gamer Limit","80","While it doesn't quite feel so new or exciting, the central premise is as brilliant as ever and Valve has enough tricks up their sleeves to keep it challenging, interesting, and hilarious as always."
"Level7.nu","80","The puzzles in Portal 2 are truly great, the co-op mode a welcome addition and the dialogues are sometimes hilarious. The constant ""enter a room, solve the puzzle, enter a new room"" formula does, however, get repetitive in the long run."
"The Escapist","80","The best sequel we could have expected. The levels just plain aren't as challenging, but the new toys and characters manage to distract enough from the cracks in the paint to keep the whole ride breezing along. It astounds in some ways and disappoints in others, which, while not perfect, is good enough for science."
"Gamekult","70","Emancipation complete for Portal, which gets rid of his ""bonus game"" condition with a second episode that is certainly no revolution but still manages to justify its new status."
