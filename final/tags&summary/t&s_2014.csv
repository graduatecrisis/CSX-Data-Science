It has been voted as Best Strategy Game of 2014 by PCGamesNMain Features Smart AI Commanders Ultimate General Gettysburg does not use “AI gameplay cheats” because it does not need them The game’s difficulty is accomplished only by nine distinctive AI personalities, each with their own advantages and special skills AI Commanders are able to evaluate and gain tactical superiority in real time, reacting according to their different commanding skills, aggressively or defensively, heroically or cunningly and resemble different, competent human players Each one of the AI generals is a formidable, non-scripted opponent who can actively try to flank you, secure strategic locations with artillery, keep reserves and reinforce areas that it attacks or defends The AI will try to win the battle with tactics that fit to its personality For example a defensive opponent may not attack ferociously in the first engagement and progressively advance its forces in the next battlesWhat players say “Fantastic AI - don't know what kind of brain you put in this game but it works”Multi-Day Dynamic Battle On the morning of July 1st 1863, the two armies meet near Gettysburg Reinforcements arrive from historically accurate directions as the battle progresses, however, random events, delays and tactical differences are always a possibility that can change the results of each engagement compared to historyCan you re-enact Pickett’s Charge? What if Lee attacked the center of the Union Army early in the morning of July 2nd of 1863 instead of attempting to flank the extreme left in the afternoon? What would happen if Meade counter-attacked on July 4th 1863? These questions and more can be answered within the game engine of Ultimate General GettysburgThe battle is dynamically fought in time phases and can last up to 4 days Each day can be separated by up to 3 time phases and the armies’ condition and positioning on the map are savedAccording to battle events, you have the possibility to take decisions that can change the tide of the battle based on your prior tactical prowess For example, when leading the Confederates, on the morning of July 2nd, you can choose to attack at Cemetery Hill and not make a delayed flanking maneuver at Peach Orchard… if you have managed to take Seminary Ridge the previous day! You can even choose to defend and wait for your AI opponent to take the initiative between days These choices greatly increase the number of possible battle outcomes and challengesWhat players say“9 different AI profiles, multiple outcomes, multiple strategies, casualties carry over This game is a different experience every time Well worth it, can't wait for the next one”Easy Controls & Unit Self-Awareness Drag simple movement arrows to command large forces easily Units do not need your micromanagement because they are able to act on their own initiative and re-align, switch targets, withdraw and form battle lines without player input Consequently, you are able to give generic commands to your units and can rely on them to fight efficiently without the need for “babysitting” What players say “Innovative movement system - this is by far an awesome system they developed It’s not only insanely easy to learn, but also incredibly innovative”Detailed Map of Gettysburg Utilizing satellite images and historical maps, every major location, house, ridge and hill are depicted as accurately as possible within the game’s unique art style If you are an American Civil War enthusiast, you will be especially happy to notice the amount of precision and information that the map provides Not only will you be able to better understand the historical layout of the map, you will also be able to make use of each location and landmark in battle, thanks to the simulation of cover, concealment, terrain and high ground in the game What players say “Incredible Gorgeous Map - I had to capitalize that because this map is by far one of the best maps of Gettysburg I have ever seen either in a game or even in books”Advanced Line of SightElevation and obstructions affect unit visibility realistically Units may make use of concealment and cover to survive artillery barrages, stage ambushes and more, but beware – the AI will attempt to do the same to you The units enter or exit the Fog of War gradually with a fade in/out effect that helps you perceive their hiding and course seamlessly What players say “The way Game Labs implemented Line of Sight in this game should be held as an example to other developers to do the same”Numerous Tactical Factors In Ultimate General Gettysburg, you will realize that army units are not “machines” that blindly follow orders, but they need to conserve strength and courage for decisive battle actions Every basic tactical element that is expected for a strategy game is incorporated into gameplay Most importantly, morale is affected by many factors including flank or rear attacks, casualties, volley shocks, artillery fire and fatigue What players say “ positioning of units matters You really bring the struggles of 19th century warfare to life here”Historically Accurate Forces and Leaders Ultimate General Gettysburg includes the full order of battle for the Union Army of the Potomac and the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia Unit sizes range from the small artillery batteries to vast infantry brigades with cavalry and skirmishers in betweenAll brigades have troop numbers and differing competencies based on historical facts Additionally, all artillery battery numbers and types are correctly simulated Lastly, major generals and officers actively participate in the battlefield to organize and support the armies and appear in after action battle reports to help you monitor battle progress What players say “Immersive American Civil War feel sounds, portraits and general historical authentic really make this one of the most immersive historical games I have played, and I am a total history buff”Furthermore, every inch of the map has a strategic role Sloping, terrain type and obstructions affect unit movement realistically Elevations, ridges and hills provide excellent firing positions and give increased sight, morale and accuracy to troops stationed thereBy placing your units close to each other, they become more resilient to charges and flank attacks but get more vulnerable to projectile fire Thus, forcing your enemy to keep his lines dense while you shell him with artillery can be a valid tactic As the condition of your units changes dynamically during the battle, the effectiveness of your whole army is affected For example, units fire more coordinated volleys when they have high morale and have more discipline and tight formationsThese and many more deep gameplay mechanics are packed into a simple and intuitive GUI that aims to ease the game experience for the player without overwhelming with complex statisticsEvolving Multiplayer ExperienceThe game currently offers 18 maps for 1vs1 matches and is continuously improved according to user feedback What players say “Well, actually, the AI in this game is about the best ever seen (except for chess), and there is a working multiplayer with about always at least one battle going”Ultimate General Gettysburg is developed by Game Labs and designed by Nick Thomadis, known for his successful and popular “DarthMod” seriesHow to Play Please read our guide"

it’s takes on platforming, dungeon-crawling, and RPGs is unique and well mixed together so that one type of play benefits the other It also has some incredible visuals, with very detailed character designs and a classic cyberpunk attitude, but not also without a bit of whimsy as well (one derelict has given up on his mission, becoming a toymaker and has begun recreating his simulation with child-like automatons)"" -GamingSymmetrycom""So after encountering this on Rock Paper Shotgun, I was ready to declare my indie game of the year Because any game made rock solid out of derelict, insane robots just makes my not-so-inner geek squeal How insane are the robots? Each is actively running a matrix like test bed, and Well, one was building a mining simulator, decided that was too depressing, and started making toys Another is trying to capture the artistic essence of the soul, but cant seem to make anything run for more than five seconds The next is attempting to rebuild humanity out of two tissue samples Then there's the one still running straight, he seems curiously nice And the last one's dead and frozen But still drawing powerThen there's the coffee pot Which is you Sort of And hey, bonus!

Damned is a randomized online horror game for up to 5 players (4 survivors and 1 monster) You’ll be able to play as one of four people trapped in different haunted places (hotels, hospitals, etc)As a survivor your main objective will be finding your way out, as well as helping your friends get out too You’ll often find yourself on the edge, hearing and seeing ghostly things, trying to find keys and items to help in your escape And sometimes you’ll find yourself running desperately from a monster, who’s there only to find and kill you and your friends You’ll also be able to play as the monster The game will feature different monsters, each one unique in its gameplay and hunting style- What kind of horror game is Damned? Damned explores the sense of being defenseless against a powerful supernatural force The survivors can’t directly affect the monster in any way When it’s there to get you, your only chance is to run and hide This perception of being defenseless is very strong, primal and terrifying, it builds up anxiety and makes you really scared, fearing any unexplained noise or movement This is how Damned creates horror in a multiplayer game session, and we believe it to be super effective! (tested and approved!) - Why is Damned a randomized game? Every stage in Damned is randomized Almost all the objects in a stage may or may not appear; The item system is fully random too, randomizing which item will appear in the game, and where it'll be; The way to win a match as a survivor is also randomized;Even the stage may trigger random events to scare the survivors inside- Why is Damned a competitive and cooperative game? Because in a full game, with 4 survivors and 1 monster, there’ll be a survivor “team” cooperating to try and escape together, and at the same time they’ll be competing against a monster, trying to flee from him and deny each one of its attempt to hunt and kill a survivor - How to play as a survivor? As a survivor you’ll be cooperating with your friends (up to 4 survivors in a single game session) You and your friends will be searching the level for keys and items to help in your escape; Each survivor will have a flashlight that can be turned on and off, helping you see your surroundings, but at the same time letting the monster know where you are; The survivors will be able to manipulate objects throughout the hotel, like drawers, doors, safes, cabinets, wardrobes; Challenge yourself to find the exit and get out alive- How to play as the monster? As the monster, your game will be all about competing alone against the survivors team The game will feature different monsters, each one unique in its play style It's up to you to play a few rounds with each monster and decide which one works best for youHow are you going to hunt and kill the survivors?- Why is Damned worth buying? Because it’s fun! It’s really scary, you’ll find yourself on the edge a lot of times, trying to evade the monster or trying to pay closer attention because you don’t know if the sound you just heard is some random noise or if it is the monster haunting you It’s a real horror game, it explores deeply the feeling of being completely defenseless against a powerful force that can finish you easily Your only choice is to run and hide! And also because it’s really fun to play as the monster as well You’ll keep haunting and building up anxiety in people, making them terribly scared of you We really put you in the skin of a terrifying monster - Links and contact Got any questions and/or suggestions?

pros and consWeapons and devices need more pointsDeck Cube need less,the cheap deck can be used to collide enemy ship hull,Higher deck give the weapons longer shoot range and protect devices behind itBut more decks make your ship heavier,penalize you in low move and steer speedSome weapons are more effective in numbers,such as single mortar has low accuracy,but plenty of mortars shoot at same time make enemy hard to escapeSo it's better to allocate points in several kinds of weapons than buy all kinds all devicesBesides,combined weapon is mush more powerful than scattered ones Critical SkillThe top most 3 kinds of devices can use Critical Skill in game  by clicking the Critical Skill buttonMore devices need more cool down time,which are more powerful as wellAfter you release the critical skill,the weapons will keep in critical model for a short timeEvery device has special critical skillSome weapon increase attack point,some weapon increase fire rate,the thrust increase force,Energy shield refill its energy and increase energy regenerate rate,Armor refill health point and increase defense rateUse critical skill at right time is the key to win a battle,some critical skill can be used together,such as use critical thrust to rush to enemy then use critical armor to collide itUse both critical thrust and critical cannon to fall back and push the following enemy

This Game,Fantasy Grounds is an application acting as a virtual online gaming table primarily intended for pen and paper style narrative role playing games  It is designed to perform many of the things you can do while playing at a conventional gaming table and move it onlineShop DLC in the updated Steam StoreYou can browse by category more easily from the SmiteWorks Publish Page link belowSmiteWorks Publisher PageA Note about DLC for Fantasy GroundsFantasy Grounds has a wealth of DLC available as add-ons Each of these DLC add-ons expands Fantasy Grounds to support a brand new game system or to add new adventures and supplements from your favorite game publishers and artists SmiteWorks has negotiated license deals with several dozen different RPG Game publishers and artists, both large and small, to bring you a very large variety of gaming options Our agreements with these publishers and artists provide royalties for every purchase made through Steam and elsewhere, so that a purchase of DLC for Fantasy Grounds is the equivalent to or better for the publisher than walking into a game store or book store and buying a physical book from the publisher Each and every purchase is directly helping fund and grow the RPG hobby industry The share that SmiteWorks retains for this helps pay our content and programming developers and helps us add support for more and more games In many cases, the content you can buy as DLC can be built directly by you within Fantasy Grounds if you already own the material in another form The DLC provides a convenient option for time-strapped gamers who also wish to directly support the gaming industry* This is not a stand-alone game This game features no computer controlled AI and relies upon another user acting as a Gamemaster to control the story, action and enemies you faceOverviewFantasy Grounds is a hybrid application which allows you to play and create your own RPG games It facilitates this play and provides some optional add-on Adventure modules which can be loaded and played with very little preparation Each game will require a GameMaster (GM) and one or more players Games may be played in a session as short as a few hours or continued with multiple sessions over a series of days, weeks, months or years A GM will typically install the application and choose their game-system of choice, which we refer to as a Ruleset Fantasy Grounds comes pre-loaded with Rulesets supporting compatible play for Dungeons & Dragons 35, Dungeons & Dragons 4E, Dungeons & Dragons fifth edition and the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game (R) Additional Rulesets are available for free and for purchase from our Workshop The 35E, 5E and PFRPG rulesets are good places to start for new GMs and for people new to Fantasy Grounds These Rulesets come pre-loaded with some basic Library modules full of abilities, spells, monsters and items that have been marked as Open Gaming Content (OGC) by their respective copyright holders  The 5E ruleset contains all the content from the D&D Basic Rules for D&D fifth edition Additional rulesets, such as that for Call of Cthulhu or Savage Worlds are fully licensed versions and contain otherwise closed and proprietary content that we've licensed from those publishers As of April 2015, Fantasy Grounds acquired an official license from Wizards of the Coast for D&D fifth edition This means that the 5E ruleset supports basic understanding and gameplay for D&D fifth edition but you can also buy fully preloaded data packs and adventures that are licensed from Wizards of the Coast as DLC here on SteamPlayersFor players, Fantasy Grounds will allow you to connect to a game being hosted by a GM and control one or more characters within the game You will be able to update and maintain your character sheet, much like you would in a face-to-face RPG game, but with some degree of automation and support for dragging and dropping abilities and items from the Library modules (for rulesets which support them) Whenever a GM shares a map image, you will be able to move a token representing your character and initiate attack rolls against enemies visible on those maps when it is your turn You will be interacting within the GM's game session with other players and every action you take will be communicated to the GM and connected players along with any chat messages you enter into the chat window At the conclusion of the GM's game session, you will log out and your character sheet and progress will be saved to the GM's session When you meet back up and a pre-scheduled time with the GM for the next session, you will be able to continue where you left off  Scheduling of future game sessions is handled outside of Fantasy Grounds via email communication, the Fantasy Grounds forums and Game Calendar, Steam discussions or through whatever source the GM defines  SmiteWorks hopes to improve the match-making features at a later dateGameMastersFor GameMasters, Fantasy Grounds will allow you to outline and prepare your future game sessions You will be able to create story entries and link them together or to specific maps You could, for instance, create a story entry which links to an image of a dungeon and then each room could in turn be linked to individual story entries -- each containing room descriptions, secret GM notes, a list of NPCs and monster encounters or links to more images and player hand-outs Depending on your game master style and the availability of pre-entered monsters and enemies, you can also run without preparation You can create and maintain multiple Campaigns, each with their own content and players When you are ready to run your campaign, you will need to spend some time recruiting players and establishing your preferred frequency and length of play, methods of communication when you are not connected with Fantasy Grounds and whether or not you want to use a voice application such as Skype or Google Hangouts alongside Fantasy Grounds Most GMs tend to use a combination of in-game text-based chat within Fantasy Grounds *and* a voice application to help facilitate quicker and more natural playWith this version of the product, you canRun games as the Gamemaster (GM)Host games as a GM for other players and GMs who are connected as playersHost a demo game for 1 player who is using only

2014,"Probability 0","Indie,Action,Platformer,Rogue-like",",About This Game,Probability 0 is a downward-scrolling infinite arcade platformerThere are a million ways to fight for survivalDescend as you combat the darkness, improve yourself Build yourself up as a star-thrower or a teleporting menace Learn to traverse the pit's many dangers, from threatening monsters to unforgiving gravity Walk across spikes that once frightened you Punch through walls that would have doomed you You'll never be invincibleDescend enemies grow more numerous They will destroy the floors beneath your feet, spit death at you, and cannibalize and infect each other in their mad swarming Your foes will be invisible, or reckless, or explosive, or seemingly untouchable Deeper dangers will always find a wayDescend and die, as you did last time and as you will next time But find your way deeperThere are a million ways to fight for survival There is no way to survive~Let's talk like people, now, and not like the back of a videogame boxI designed Probability 0 years ago, and released its first version for free in late 2009 Back then, it embraced a randomly-generated landscape (so I wouldn't get bored of it), introduced higher-order enemies to the spawn queue in a random order (so I wouldn't get bored of them), and allowed you to buy upgrades from a vast and unrestrictive talent tree (so I wouldn't get bored of those) Oh, and death wipes everything (so I wouldn't just get everything and then get bored of playing & replaying the whole thing)On top of that, the enemies and powers are designed to be significantly different from one another There's an enemy who literally eats other enemies and spits their digested corpses at you (Mechanically speaking, their 'digested corpses' are always the same handful of red globs -- but what fun is it, thinking like that?) There are more mundane enemies, of course, but one who moves in random, erratic angles is very different to fight than one who always moves straight towards youThe set of powers, on the other hand, were made to offer you a lot of choices There are ~36 of them and contain nearly zero arbitrary prerequisites Buy the powers you want to have, not the boring ones you'll need for the future Every time you level up, a new row opens up and you can buy anything from any row except for abilities that build on a lesser version of itself -- you can't get the 'never take fall damage' powerup without first having the 'take less fall damage' one There are also none that don't augment your choices in an interesting way You're not choosing between +10% armour and +10% damage; who cares, when you could instead be choosing between immunity to every spike in the game and upgrading your punch to kill any enemy in one hit? Those aren't even top-tier powersI'm still not bored of this game, and remember that it started in 2009 There are boss enemies who appear intermittently, to shake things up There are enough abilities to try thousands of different builds, if you're feeling a little stale There are enemies who don't even appear until you've gone deeper than I can most of the time You'll probably die before seeing any of these things, but don't let that stop you Keep dying~Don't forget about JMickle's dynamic music Its layers fluctuate as you dive deeper the bass comes and goes; the chords swell and die; and the sirens scream as death approaches You can hear it in the trailer, in the game itself, and even more below -- click on the soundtrack in blue and the remix album in magenta"

While the main story may take you between two to three hours to complete, you can search for hours for all the little hints and references to real world events, as well as dozens of hidden collectibles and all-round secret content Always in control As seen in our previous, much smaller game They Breathe, The Working Parts are devoted to telling stories in new ways while keeping interactivity at the forefront That's why Residue isn't a point-and-click, but rather a visceral platform adventure where you're always in control, whether you're monkeying around the ship graveyard or diving through underground tunnels, navigating old Jumagul through dark corridors with a flickering flashlight, or ascending the side of the gigantic stranded drillship with Nikolai's makeshift grappling hook Around every corner, Residue will show you something new"

Have a good adventure!Why create a game for Neo Geo?Several reasons pushed us to develop for this console The Neo-Geo is a legend amongst consoles, and is the one we dreamed of throughout our childhood and teenage years For this reason, when we decided to bring our main character “Ninja Pony” to life, we wanted his early adventures to take place in the Neo-Geo universe Thus we are offering our beloved Pony this welcoming present to be born into the world of this “Rolls Royce” of consoles Having our character emerge on cartridge is a way of enshrining him in the Pantheon of video game heroes, alongside Sonic and Mario It's a way of going back in time! It also made sense with regards to the character's back-story Crouching Pony Hidden Dragon relates the teenage years of Ninja Pony This parallels the advent of the Neo-Geo in the history of video games this console personifies gaming's teenage years Last but not least there were technical challenges we were eager to overcome We realized that there were very few traces of the tools and documentation required to develop games on Neo-Geo What's more this arcane knowledge was gradually disappearing! We had to become archaeologists, investigating, looking for clues, piecing together how these games were developed We created our own software and hardware pipe-lines, started working directly in pixel art again, etc We were able to leverage our experience working on “modern” video games in returning to blow the dust off these old techniques It was an exciting job, a true act of video game craftsmanship!Why bring the game to PC?When we announced the Neo Geo version many expressed regret at not being able to play the game Since our main ambition at Le Cortex is to offer original play experiences to as many people as possible we wanted to avoid restricting the release to Neo-Geo connoisseurs and collectors So we decided to port the game to the gamers' platform of today the PC And in case you were wondering this is indeed a full native port, not the Neo-Geo ROM being run via an emulator!About Le CortexLe Cortex is an independent French Studio located in Paris We design, write and develop games which aim to offer brand new play experiences"

2014,"Near Impact","Strategy,Action",",About This Game,The nations of Earth were on the verge of war when the first asteroid struck  It was soon followed by a second, then a third, then more falling in a cascade of burning death and destruction  Much of the world was turned into an inhospitable wasteland by the sudden onset of impact winter  As the people of Earth set about building new floating cities to survive above the devastation, scientists studying the impacts realized that Earth had not encountered the asteroids naturally; we’d been attacked  The Orbital Defense Department (ODD) was founded to protect the planet from future attacks, and to prepare a scouting mission to find out who had launched the asteroids,In the years since the attack, ODD has completed construction of humanity’s first starship and is preparing for its maiden voyage  But deep space sensors have picked up a new wave of asteroids, far larger than the first, and it’s uncertain that the starship will be ready in time  ODD has deployed one of the starship’s exploration and defense drone robots, controlled by a crack team of drone operators, to hold off the asteroids and protect the cities of Earth while the starship prepares to launch,Features,Drone vs Asteroid Combat – Players will have access to rapid-fire railguns, target-seeking missiles, short range high-energy plasma cannons, and rocket-powered fists in their attempt to halt the asteroid attack,Orbital Mechanics –The drone robot is in motion circling Earth, so players have to compensate for their changing position  Earth’s gravitational pull affects the player’s missiles and railgun rounds, causing them to follow shifting arcs of fire  Asteroids speed up as they approach Earth and those that appear to be near misses may curve and hit the planet, or be sent into long orbits that will bring them back around as a later threat,Ground Force Management – Players can click on a city and, using currency earned by destroying asteroids, commission ships, submarines, aircraft, tanks, and ground installations, all equipped with railguns and/or missiles, to provide a final line of defense around high population areas,Upgrades – Players can click on a city and, using currency earned by destroying asteroids, commission upgrades to improve the drone robot’s fighting abilities  Players can commission increased projectile speed, range, and damage for each of their weapons, as well as new sensors to make the asteroids easier to hit  Players can upgrade the capabilities of their defensive units in the same manner Once an upgrade for the drone robot is ready it will automatically be launched to the supply pod that is in orbit, and the robot has to go obtain it  Any upgrade to a tower unit will automatically be deployed to the particular tour unit ,The Team – Players can choose a team of four drone operator characters from a selection of candidates  In addition to letting players know when important events occur (like running out of ammunition or picking up a new asteroid on the sensors) and talking back and forth as they attempt to one-up each other, the characters can provide bonuses to whatever drone robot system they’re assigned to,Ascending Difficulty – The longer a player lasts, the more difficult the game becomes  The number of asteroids per wave increases, they begin spawning from new angles of attack, and new, more resistant types of asteroid are introduced,Variable Play Styles – Players who balances all of NEAR ImpactTM’s elements have the potential to score higher than players who pick and choose, players have a range of options for playing the game their way  Players who dislike shooters can play NEAR ImpactTM as a tower defense game  Players who dislike tower defense can play the game purely as a shooter  Players can get through asteroid waves without changing their orbit, or they can take manual control of the drone robot’s thrusters and have to rendezvous with upgrades and ammunition"

2014,"Koya Rift","Indie",",About This Game,Koya Rift is an action-packed platform shooter that is built around circular, adaptive gameplay that emphasizes replay value by challenging the player with procedural content tuned to their skill level In Koya Rift, the player must enter a hostile planet and destroy an alien race so the planet can be colonized Each game, the player is dropped off at the surface and must venture into procedurally generated caves, earning upgrades and buying units as he goes along The difficulty adjusts precisely to the skill of the player over time, providing them with a consistent challenge The goal of the game is to provide a challenging, yet casual experience that’s easy to pick up and put downA game of Koya Rift is pretty straightforward – you find yourself above ground standing in front of one of the delivery pods from the mercenary mothership Your minimap hides the area below ground – and you have no idea what awaits you The terrain of each level is procedurally generated (meaning it uses advanced algorithms to make itself different every time, providing nearly endless possibilities) Below ground lies a web of tunnels and caverns that is different every single time you play It’s impossible to know what awaits you behind every corner Procedural generation isn't just in the level – all of your enemies will seem different too Their size, speed, color, health, damage, and weapon behavior will be unique for each one you fight Your own weapons are generated the same way – the Lances you bring along with you to levels are generated out of endless possibilities One gun may fire large, single shot energy blasts that slow down and weaken all enemies in a large radius, where another gun will shoot bursts of many bullets that curve in every direction with a waving motion, another gun that fires several shots at once but can pierce through walls and home after enemies, and another that heals and enhances your alliesYou have to venture down into the unfamiliar cave system and eliminate all of the Phantom Crystals (Where the enemy soldiers are grown) Unfortunately the Phantoms are hunting you the whole time, while their crystals evolve and grow If you manage to destroy all the enemy crystals, you win the levelDon’t get too proud though – if you beat it too easily the game will know and will be sure to adjust the difficulty for next time Game difficulty in Koya Rift is complex – it’s not a simple modification to the amount of health you have, and it isn't a simple easy-normal-hard scale Difficulty is a very precise unit of measurement that expands near-infinitely in either direction in this game If you beat your last couple of levels easily it will slightly increase, if you keep getting beaten down without a fight it will decrease to help you out Difficulty adjustments affect almost everything in game – from the reaction speed of the Phantoms, to the speed at which they grow and evolve, to the cost of your allies, the experience they need to level up, the accuracy, size, fire rate, and density of your energy weapons,  the rate of health recovery, the effects of special weapons, the size of the levels you play on, the health and damage of your enemies, the speed and fragility of your allies, the cash value of killing an opponent, the swiftness and force of enemy attacks, and even more There are so many values that change, and when they do change, they change with such subtlety that you will not be able to pick out exactly why this next game seems like more of a challenge for you than last, or why you’re finally able to beat that one level that you were stuck on for so longThese items combine to create an excellent formula for expandable gameplay – in the end you have a game that you can always come back to and find something different, and always be challenged regardless of your ability"

2014,"Abalone","Strategy,Casual,Board Game",",About This Game,Discover our new version with brand new graphics inspired by the latest edition of the famous strategy game Abalone has been one of the best games around for nearly 30 years, known for its hexagonal board and black and white marbles The goal of this abstract board game is simple push your opponent’s marbles off the board! But beware, it’s not easy to master, so keep your wits about you and rise to the challenge! HAVE A PLAN OF ATTACK Create a plan of attack to push your opponent’s marbles off the board On every turn, you can move one space in any direction with 1, 2, or 3 lined-up marbles When you’re in a Sumito position (that is, when your marbles both outnumber and are in contact with your opponent’s) you can push their marbles out! For example, you need three black marbles to push one or two white marbles There’s no use in rushing; it’s better to take your time and think of every possibility since one hasty move can put you in a bad position and let victory slip through your fingers AND HAVE A STRONG DEFENSE If you want to win, the key is not to attack, but rather to take specific positions with certain combinations of moves Just like in chess and checkers, you can try to create traps by sacrificing marbles or strategic positions to block your opponent The most dangerous contact points are at the edges of the board, where a bad move means losing a marble or the whole game! Sometimes, it’s better to be patient if you want to win! DON’T CONFUSE FORESIGHT AND HASTE The keys to victory are looking ahead and analyzing your opponent’s play Although the game is easy to learn, it requires strategy and thought To hone your strategic thinking, the game offers several modes that let you review your games play by play For example, Challenge Mode helps you become a true Abalone master, one move at a time The challenges get harder as you advance For example, at first you must push out a single marble only to win a challenge, then two, and the master will get progressively tougher PLAY ALONE OR WITH FRIENDS Play alone against the computer with Challenge Mode and Free Play Mode, or play against your friends With Pass & Play Mode, you can duel on the same device! Tired of playing your friends? Face the best players in the world with Online Mode by logging in to your Asmodee account! Features Solo- 3 levels of difficulty against the AI (Easy, Medium, Hard)- A solo campaign with unique challenges- A game mode that lets you create your own game, your own rules, and place the first marbles Multiplayer - Pass & Play Mode- Online Mode Available in English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, and Dutch"
2014,"Movie Studio Boss: The Sequel","Simulation,Casual,Indie",",About This Game,You have just been appointed the head of a new Movie Studio and have been given 10 (now 50) years to make it the most successful studio around You are up against seven other computer controlled Studios all trying to be the best Studio in the world You are judged in three ways - most turnover, most profit and most awardsAs the Studio Boss you have lots of decisions to make, including controlling the budget, deciding what type of film you are going to make, hiring a scriptwriter, getting the best director, trying to get the screenplay right, negotiating with the stars, handling problems on set, getting the post-production right and that’s all before you worry about the cinema release You’ve got marketing costs, web publicity, test screenings, how many screens to show the film on, when to hit the International markets, when to sell it to TV, how long before you put it on DVD and much, much more! Turn based (each turn represents a week), yet has time pressure Players have around 10 minutes to make all their decisions each turn and can end the week early if they want  More than one way to win Bosses can win by being the best at making high turnover, profitable or classic award-winning films  Each section of the game is designed as a ‘mini-game’ in itself  Success is firmly in the hands of the player Decisions they make (and they have many to consider) always affect their box office  Covers pretty much the entire movie making experience  You are up against seven other computer-controlled players  We keep the numbers sensible - you do not see $1,067,345 ever in our game Just $1M This helps to keep the game from looking too much like a spreadsheetBack in the late 90s I thought it would be fun to create a game about running a Movie Studio in the style of a soccer management game This genre is one I know well having worked on Atari ST/Amiga games like Kenny Dalglish Soccer Manager and Gazza's Super Soccer – it's hard to believe that these titles are now over 25 years old! So Movie Studio Boss was born and released around 2001 on our experimental website/shop PlaceforGamesJump forward to 2014 and I thought it would be fun to get back into writing games again So what to do first? I thought it would be sensible to update some of my old titles and as Movie Studio Boss was always a favourite I thought I'd start with that one Movie Studio Boss is certainly showing it's age – I'm pretty sure Hollywood doesn't release too many titles on video now! Plus technically it's screen resolution was fixed at 800 x 600 – which looks like a postage stamp on modern computer screens So MSB The Sequel it is My old artist friend Gary agreed to collaborate and Movie Studio Boss has been updatedBesides giving me the chance to get it to run on screens which have larger resolutions there's lots of technical benefits including improved audio (players of the old game will be pleased to note that the tunes I wrote have been replaced with a great score from some new friends Guy, Tim & Bradley) and the ability to have more people on screen In MSBTS every film has a Production Assistant who will dress in a costume relevant to the film and will walk around the Studio letting you know what stage of production the film is inAs well as updating the gameplay – introducing Blu-ray and updating the financial model –  and pretty much all the graphics I got the chance to add in new features; animated films, musicals, age rating, personnel profiles, more detailed film credits, more reports, notification icons and moreThanks For Your TimeEdward"
